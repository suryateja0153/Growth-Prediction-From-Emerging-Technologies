 Hola amigos qué tal, Stuart here from Spain Speaks with an update of the current situation here in Spain day 30 of the lockdown that's right day 30 30 days we have been confined and no end in sight yet firstly thanks to all of the people that left comments on the last video more than 500 comments on the last video so thanks for that keep those comments coming along in the section below a huge thanks to people that decided to support the channel you can see your names there and remember that if you want to support the channel there are ways to do it in the section below as well now let's get stuck into some of the news that has happened over the last couple of days and firstly hot off the press we can see that fatalities have dropped again after yesterday's rally 517 in 24 hours and we can see here in the graph that the trend is definitely on the way down which is good news but if we go down here and have a look at the people infected and the fatality rate we can see that there's a hundred and sixty nine thousand four hundred and ninety-six official cases in Spain with 17,000 489 fatalities and a fatality rate here of more than 10% which is remarkably high now today Monday some non-essential workers can go back to their places of work after a two-week hibernation period and we can see here some of the things that can and cannot be done in the new phase of the alarm state non-essential services that stopped with the hibernation decree may return to work but confinement is maintained for the rest of the population obviously some people are not happy about having to go back to work but the government thinks that it is necessary for these non-essential jobs to pick up again a lot of people are scared and we can see here from this person's comment no se pod kennedy 'this tenemos que polar bear to see now for them in their star separado x' and in english that means i don't know why the hell we have to go back to work if there is no way to be a part so these are some of the worries that people have going back to work are they going to be protocols in place are people going to be wearing masks are people going to be wearing gloves are people going to be separated enough in order to be safe those are the questions that people are asking and I know personally that if I had to go back to work I would be a little bit apprehensive having to take a metro or other means of public transport that can normally be crowded in the mornings in the big cities here in Spain so who can and who cannot return to work let's have a look here so employees who cannot telework from companies or factories in non-essential sectors these are mainly in the industrial sector officers such as law firms and construction however it is stipulated that if your construction activity is not outdoors you're not allowed to return to work so people that are doing renovation works let's say in private homes and not allowed to return to work who cannot leave home home confinement and the travel invitations of the first alarm status decree will remain in place citizens can only go out to buy food or sanitary products go to work go to the bank attend the elderly children or dependents and other displacements due to force majeure you can also walk the dog in the vicinity of your home - cannot go out for a walk or to the park now which activities remain stopped so we can see here that the stoppage of work activity continues on all those service jobs facing the public or non-essential that is bars and restaurants except food delivery hotels leisure establishments cultural activities or sports centers the shops with the exception of those for food or basic necessities will also continue to have their shutters lowered classrooms will remain empty and educational centers of all levels domestic workers cannot work unless they have to care for the elderly - or people with disabilities now had a comment on one of my podcasts from a lady called Janice who because of health reasons is doing it a bit tough at the moment she says that she has sore joints and sore knees and she wanted to know if from today she would be able to ride her bike around the answer to that Genesis know people are still confined to their homes and remember that if you are caught doing these activities there are quite heavy fines in place so Janice the answer is no you can't ride your bike around now an interesting headline that caught my attention is that the IBEX companies those big companies in Spain are preparing for the reactivation and they're considering health passports for immune employees and what they mean by this is that they are considering using the equivalent of a health passport to identify workers with a new to this virus and they would be the first platoon to rejoin with full guarantees for having generated the antibodies and not being diffuses so people that have recovered from the virus people that have gone through the virus could get a health passport which means that they are able to go back to their places of work and people that haven't gone through the situation yet will obviously have to remain at home or remain working from home now somebody in the comment section also pointed out that the European Parliament will investigate whether Sanchez's state of alarm has violated fundamental rights apparently in the opinion of a Spanish lawyer what the government takes pretends to be limitation constitutes in reality an effective suspension of the rights of free movement which is a fundamental right of the person included not only in the European Convention on Human Rights but also in other international human rights treaties and of course in the Spanish constitution to this lawyer obviously thinking that these measures in place here at the moment are anti constitutional now the newspaper in question got in contact with the Human Rights Commission of the European Parliament and they confirmed the receipt of the complaint and they say that we are currently studying the case and it was presented by a Spanish lawyer Jose Ortega so here we can see that some people obviously feel that their human rights are being violated and a lawyer has decided to take the case to the European Parliament so it'll be interesting to see how this situation ends up what's your opinion on this are our rights being violated or in a state of alarm does the government have the right to do whatever it feels necessary and finally another headline that caught my attention about Sweden remember that Sweden is one of the countries that has decided to do things a little bit differently we can see here that Sweden now acknowledges not having done enough to combat the virus and the Prime Minister is preparing the population for thousands of deaths but resists imposing the same confinement of other European countries so again I'll ask our viewers in Sweden to comment on this are you happy with the way things are being dealt with there do you think things should have been done sooner with stricter confinement rules or do you agree with how things have been going down there so leave those comments in the section below now let's have a look at the comments on the last video the first one here is from John C he says hi Stuart, great videos shame you don't do them daily with a recession on the horizon are our save safe in Spanish banks what's your opinion John from Spain now John to be honest I haven't thought too much about this the little money that I have is in Spanish banks and I haven't thought about moving it but I understand there is some concern about the strength of banks at the moment all around the world not only here in Spain remember that the Spanish banking sector went through a crisis about six or seven years ago which was fairly severe and the government does have guarantees in place to protect savings of up to a hundred thousand euros and I don't think there's been any changes to that legislation as yet so money up until that amount apparently is still guaranteed from the government however you could argue does the government have enough resources so I'll open that question up again for the viewers what's your opinion is our money safe in Spanish banks or in other European banks at the moment?Another comment here from Adam he says online education is coming governments will unburden themselves in a big way this will result in burdening working parents beyond reason it will also result in decimating the education sector currently the largest public employer as one single online teacher can reach hundreds of thousands your good comment Adam it is true that at the moment a lot of schools have been forced into an online learning scenario in fact there are lots and lots of online learning platforms out there in fact that six or seven years ago I did a post graduate course in online education so I know a fair bit about it but it remains to see whether traditional schools will follow this model in the future but you are right that online education does have that potential to reach a lot of people and the traditional classroom situation could be in danger but who knows again I'll let you guys discuss it in the comment section another comment here from Mary Ann Miller she says thanks George for keeping us in touch we're from Ireland but living in the province of Granada and really appreciate your regular updates as we are fairly isolated like so many as you described it much easier to enter a lockdown than leave it we are really interested to know how Spain and others are going to do this any thoughts incremental extensions to lockdown are obvious a bit like Adelaide Ryan Air flight keep up the good work Mansilla and Marian it is true there is a rumor that the lockdown is going to continue beyond April 26th maybe go through to May 10 possible even longer thing official yet the Prime Minister did hint in the last parliamentary session that they're most likely will be an extension beyond that April 26th but I'd probably put my money on there being an extension at this point another comment here from Helen she says thanks so much for the updates jus you've kept me informed while in quarantine and a familiar voice to hear when none were around on my way back to Australia now enough is enough for me stay strong and keep laughing so interesting here Helen obviously an Aussie that's been in Spain decided enough is enough and she's been able to get a flight back to Australia and I suppose it is the case of a lot of people that are in this situation they don't want to be in Spain or they don't want to be in another country while this is going on they'd prefer to be back home because the situation is a little bit better in Australia at the moment there aren't as many cases but again we don't know how this is going to pan out in the future for any country around the world really but Helen decided to go back to Australia and leave Spain now one hear from Andy he says my Spanish friend went to the pharmacy today and was provided with a free face mask however when I went to collect the prescription today from the same pharmacy there wasn't any masks available I asked but I was told they didn't have any I noticed that all the Spanish had masks I've lived here five years and it's the first time I felt like we are not welcome here and there is a clear bias against us immigrants now sorry to hear that Andy I wasn't aware that there was any discrimination going on I'm not sure exactly where you are in Spain but if it is the case it sounds like there's a bit of a problem I haven't heard any other comments about this happening so maybe it's an isolated case I did get another comment here from Stephen who's in Alicante and he said that the police are calling it every house handing out masks good on him obviously it depends on where you are but I don't think Spanish pharmacists would be discriminating against people if they're not Spanish but if anybody else has had a problem like this please let us know in the comment section below John van Campen says I fear Spain is under estimating the sociological problems that already exist and still have no solutions I see a lot of unrest rising soon popular comment this one it got 12 thumbs up John I don't know it's all speculation they could be unrest a lot of people are probably getting sick of being confined who knows what's going to happen in the future I can only imagine that the longer this goes on the more difficult it's gonna be for the police to keep people confined I can only say that from a personal point of view I hope that there isn't a lot of civil unrest and were able to come out of this confinement as smoothly as possible one here from Betty Boop she says update from very very south direction al Qaida's since this morning armed masked police at every round about stopping and checking all vehicles papers and purposes friendly but very firm cast iron tight security shops normal supplies no fancy goods stay Fitness they safe Spain speaks fans yeah thanks for the update there I didn't see that there was an increased police presence around some of the coastal areas obviously they were trying to stop people from going to second homes to spend the east the week and I think that's one of the reasons why they were increased police controls and checks and a lot of roundabouts especially in coastal areas one here from J of how they say please throw in some Spanish if you like with subtitles it makes it more interesting bueno para algunos como ves sería interesante ver mi hablar Castellano pero de momento no lo voy a hacer simplemente porque la mayoría de la gente que esta canal habla inglésy no habla Castellano, a lo mejor no habla Castellano perfectamente entonces no lo voy hacer la verdad que es que hacer subtitulos es un coñazo así que no lo voy hacer de momento gracias por el comentario Leslie says here I noticed you often use the diphthong for your C and s sounds which is regionally proper but you don't use them when saying Barcelona no biggie I'm just always expecting to hear barthelona thank you for your reports now thanks for the comment normally it depends I realized sometimes I'm not very consistent on this sometimes when I see a word like Barcelona I just say it as I would in English but if I see another word like al-kifah des or hadith I would probably say it like I would say it in Spanish so sorry for the inconsistencies a I'll try to improve it in the future and finally a comment here from dgn one stay strong stew and keep up the good work this will end remember this is just the blip in the long history of our world it will get better yeah thanks for the comment there dgn I agree with you this will end eventually it is just the blip in the long history of our world as we are all just a small blip in the bigger picture and things will get better eventually I don't know when exactly but I am optimistic that things will get better so on that note I'll wrap the video up questions or comments please leave them in the section below debate the situation out as you normally do I'll see you in the next video hasta luego stay safe
