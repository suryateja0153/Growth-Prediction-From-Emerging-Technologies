 hi I'm dr. battle on mesh Co the medical futurist and today I'm going to tackle a special topic I never thought I'm going to address conspiracy theories especially not through a whole video on them but during a medical crisis like the one we face today lies are not just misleading they are outright dangers so I feel like it's my duty to debunk them because the only way we can overcome a crisis like this is to understand the challenge and to fight it together not to entertain ourselves with half-baked campfire stories let's dive in so one person in one eats an uncooked bat and your local Walmart runs out of toilet paper this is such a surreal scenario that it's no wonder people are looking for alternative answers to how their normal lives got blown into pieces in the matter of weeks and in this age of misinformation when the trust in our governments and the media are at an all-time low there are plenty of conspiracy theorists who will rise to the challenge and try to push their own agenda for the susceptible population and why the truth is usually complex and oftentimes hard to understand these clean-cut conspiracy narratives are designed to prey on your pre establish suspicions so they can seem like viable alternatives and unfortunately in our ever connected social networks these theories have a tendency to spread just as rapidly as Kovan 19 does let's start with the most widespread theory that the virus escaped from a Chinese laboratory this rumor came to light because Wuhan has one of China's only level 4 by laboratories where researchers have been studying coronaviruses for a long time along with lots of other more nasty viruses I have to say this theory is at least plausible there are maps spreading on Facebook that show how close the laboratories to the Wuhan Webb market the suspected epicenter of the outbreak and our brains are naturally wired to look for patterns so people who come across this information can see this finding a missing piece of the puzzle and who doesn't like a good detective tale but first things first a level-4 by laboratory has the highest level of bio containment precautions to isolate dangerous biological agents this is a universal standard set by the CDC that is no level-5 this is as good as it gets and the chances of viruses escaping a level-4 environment are extremely low and with most conspiracy theories if you take a deeper look we discover a hidden agenda the idea that the new coronavirus originated from the Wuhan lab came from a documentary produced by the epoch times an english-language news outlet with links to a Chinese religious cult that has long been persecuted by the Chinese Communist Party in the documentary they insist on calling covet the CCP virus or the Chinese Communist Party's virus making it completely clear for the Tor agenda is advised why say that theories like these are dangers because since this notion went mainstream it has even been used by the Trump administration to cast blame on the Chinese pushing the two country's relationship to an all-time low by helping to spread this theory people only helped Chinese anti-government religious cult they probably didn't even know exists if we believe the virus came from the Wuhan lab it's easy to take another step and also hide that the virus naturally bioengineered thereby Chinese scientists as a biological weapon as I said it's harder to accept that a global catastrophe like this could happen as easily and coincidentally as it did and they feel like they are missing the bigger picture but as Neil deGrasse Tyson said the good thing about science is that it's true whether or not you believe in it and in this case the science clearly proved that copy 19 is a zoonotic virus meaning it came from an animal and jumped into the human population that fact was verified by several independent laboratories around the world and even an investigation by the United States military concluded that the weight of evidence in the it's that the viruses origin is natural but that won't stop people from spreading misinformation and now nearly 3 in 10 Americans believe that coffee 19 was made in a lab unfortunately two of those are President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo who keep on claiming that they have evidence that contradicts their own military and intelligence agencies and the scientific consensus of course that evidence is either just as elusive as from statue turns or this view mark the first time that his administration lies nevertheless this theory has come in handy for a president in election year who is looking to cast blame somewhere else now of course in response China deployed its own propaganda machine to push their own agenda lately China's foreign ministry spokesman tweeted that it's possible that the US military brought the virus to Wuhan and in this day and age it was more than enough for a new conspiracy to go widespread in China as much as Americans believe that the virus came from the wool lab a lot of people in China believe it was American military personnel who had brought the virus to China during their participation in the 2019 military bird games in Wuhan lost October and as Trump was pushing the name Wuhan virus there was accompanying attempt in China to rename copied 19 the u.s. a virus and still all of this stems from one fake documentary film it's like falling dominoes and now the two biggest superpowers in the world are at each other's throats in a war of words simply because some of us can't stop sharing unverified conspiracy theories it's a funny word isn't it and now let's travel from the land of plausible lies to straight-up crazy town this is just one of over a dozen fires targeting 5g towers in the Netherlands and the country isn't alone Cyprus Belgium and Island among those home two conspiracy theorists who believe 5g may have some connect to cope with 19 one of the biggest new conspiracy theories is that 5g networks spread the virus this theory clearly shows that the PhD is not required to create a twitter account it should be needless to say that it is biologically impossible for viruses to spread using the electromagnetic spectrum the letter R waves or photons by the former or biological particles composed of proteins and nucleic acids it's mind-boggling that I even have to address this but that's how conspiracy theories work they take something we fear like the electromagnetic radiation of 5g networks they add the suspicions like the notion that there is a hidden agenda behind the rapid rollout of 5g networks mix it up and pull it over something that already preys on our mind like the fear of copy 19 in this case or Somaly was a guy named David Icke who believes 5g is a global conspiracy to call the population his followers claim he's a world-renowned scientist who is being hunted by the medical industry for saying the truth in reality he's a former football player Sports pundit and Holocaust denier weapons to have published 20 books about the most asinine Koster's the theories you can find out there I wonder if he has any agenda by pushing this 5g narrative before his new book comes out and if anyone still believes that it's 5g towers that spread the virus Oscar said this how come that 5g networks are only deployed in 34 countries why covet 19 is presenting over 200 country at the moment now here comes my favorite copy 19 was unleashed by Bill Gates billionaires are elusive figures some of them are detached from the rest of us and some of them are straight-up evil they are perfect to be cast as villains and as far as I remember in the 90s some people believe that Gates is a lizard man creature person so when he stepped into the spotlight after Cove in 1980 there was already a prejudice against him some people clearly didn't understand what the founder of a computer company has to do with epidemiology unfortunately that confusion led to theories and those theories quickly got out of control now there are people who believe that the virus was actually created by him Twitter called a population or make a few more billions on the vaccine or both but here is a thing Gates has pretty much left the big tech arena for a while now and his foundation is the most generous philanthropic organization out there the man willing lost his place as the words richest person to save people in third-world countries it's so unfair to say that now he's trying to make that money back by killing people that it's mind-blowing gates spent much of the second act of his career initiating and supporting efforts to prevent and control infectious diseases his knowledge on viruses is on par with the world's best epidemiologists and he spent the past decade trying to prepare us for a pandemic like the one we have now just listen to him speak about it five years ago but this is a nuclear case you've got to say we take it quite seriously we budget a lot of money have a lot of people who think about nuclear deterrence and I'm very glad that works being done and I rate the chance of a nuclear war in my lifetime is being fairly low I rate the chance of a widespread epidemic far worse than Ebola and my lifetime is well over 50% as the conspiracy theory goes gates owns the patent for the new clone a virus that wasn't even discovered until January 2020 and he has shares in companies that are currently working around the clock to come up with a vaccine the latter part is actually true Gates did help fund many potential kernel virus vaccines and here is another thing he's wasting billions of dollars by doing so only for us to stay alive and to be able to go back to our normal lives as soon as possible the size and patterns that conspiracy theorists are finding here only stem from the fact that Gates is one of those who are part of the solution so for anyone who might be watching this and spreads lies about him maybe stop being the problem or at least try to be a tiny bit thankful and with that we arrived to the good old Benjamin's to the notion that a vaccine is the greatest business in the world and not a highly risky philanthropic endeavor to the notion that somehow selling surgical masks and toilet papers on a grand scale are making more money than what the global recession will burn away because one thing that's common in all these theories is that there is a group of elusive figures who unleash this virus simply to make money and frankly money is a big factor in all this but mainly for the conspiracy theorists the way baby dike is trying to sell his books or the way China and the US are trying to blame each other to come out of this crisis untainted there are many other clever actors who are trying to prey on our fears and suspicions only to sell their sketchy products between two crazy rents Alex Jones for example urges viewers to buy expensive miracle pills that he claims can cure all known diseases but when they already made up our minds that the government the mainstream media and even Big Pharma lie to us and we live in an echo chamber of like-minded people it can be hard to see that the people who push these narratives are not some truth seeking philanthropists in their own words look here's a fun listen I'll be honest with you I've got a return now it's easy to get lost in the how and the when and the who those are the questions that drive at the great detective story we can come up with an infinite number of intriguing narratives and then people are scared or feel like they are being lied to they will be susceptible enough to listen to them but the only question that should matter is the why why would Bill Gates create an elaborate mass murder scheme over decades to make a few millions why he both has more and has given away more than what he could make on a successful vaccine why would any government he was a weapon that they can't control and most likely will backfire if the global elite wants to call the population why would the use of virus that has a relatively low death rate and mostly preys on the elderly I even heard that this is a scheme so governments wouldn't have to pay pension I guess saving some of that sweet sweet pension money does make sense as we face the biggest economic meltdown of the past hundred years finally allow me to introduce you to my favorite philosophical principle Occam's razor it states that when you have two competing theories that make exactly the same predictions the simple one is usually the one that is true in this case covin 19 is exactly what it looks like an unfortunate but statistically inevitable event experts have been warning us for decades that we are long overdue for so if there is anything this pandemic should teach us is that our faith should always be in science because that's the only thing that doesn't have an agenda and is actually able to lead us out of a crisis but for that we need to come together focus on the common goal and not be subservient to the small but loud minority who claim they know better because whenever we spread a conspiracy theory chances are we have not discovered the missing puzzle piece but we are accidentally pushing someone else's agenda and the only thing science cannot do is to fight fire with fire when someone claims that the virus was by an engineered all scientists are obliged to say stuff like we didn't find evidence or the weight of evidence indicates otherwise even though it's a near hundred percent certainty because that's how science works it's subtle it's cautious it's soft speaking and that's it's handicapped too because nobody supervises the lives of Alex Jones or David Icke they can be as loud as they can and unfortunately people tend to listen to the harshest edgiest most confident voices so I think you and I on the other side have an obligation now that whenever we see others spreading misinformation they get into that conversation during easier times we could look away to have our own peace of mind but now at a time of crisis we have a duty to push the truth because now there are lives on the line as it stated HBO's Chernobyl every live I tell occurs at that to the truth and sooner or later that that is paid stay safe everybody if you liked this video and want to hear more about copy 19
