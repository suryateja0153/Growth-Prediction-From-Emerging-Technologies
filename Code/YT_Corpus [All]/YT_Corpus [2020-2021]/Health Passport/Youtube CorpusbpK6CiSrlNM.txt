 good afternoon I'm dr. Bonnie Henry the provincial health officer for British Columbia and this is our kovat 19 update for April 25th I want to start off by recognizing with gratitude that we are on the traditional and unseeded territories of the laconian speaking people's particularly the song bees and Esquimalt First Nations and we are very grateful to be able to talk to you from these really special lands today for our update today we actually have 95 new cases of covert 19 in the province today bringing our total up to 1948 and I'll address a little bit in a minute where those numbers are coming from that includes 778 in Vancouver Coastal Health Region 853 people in the Fraser Health Region 115 in the Vancouver Island Health area 160 in the interior health region and 42 people in the northern health region we have no new long-term care facility outbreaks today and one additional outbreak has been declared over so that we now have 11 long-term care facility or breaks that are over part of the reason that we've had such a dramatic jump in cases today is related to the community of aches that we've been investigating as you are aware we've had an ongoing outbreak at the Mission Federal Correctional Facility and we've done extensive testing within that facility in the last few days and so 40 of the additional cases are related to people who were who were detected at the Mission correctional facility bringing up the number of inmates who've tested positive admission to 106 and 12 staff members who are positive from the mission Institute in addition you're aware that we've had two ongoing outbreaks in workplaces including superior poultry and sixteen of the new cases today are related to the ongoing investigation at that facility the united poultry facility which was closed down a few days ago remains at 35 cases positive there and we are now up to 11 positive cases that are associated with the curl lake industrial plant in alberta in terms of our cases we have 96 people who are in hospital at this point and 41 of those people are in critical care or ICU and we've had 1137 people who are now considered fully recovered tragically we continue to have deaths related to covert 19 and we've had two additional deaths in the last day bringing our total people who have died from over 19 to 100 in British Columbia included in the deaths though in the last 24 hours is our first death in one of these these First Nations communities along with the many lives we have lost to covet 19 this is a tragedy that's beyond just us it's a tragedy for all of us our our elders in particular in our First Nations communities our culture and history keepers when they become ill and when they die we all lose and I want you to know that we feel that collective loss today my thoughts are with the for her family and her entire community as I recognize the tragic impact this has on all of them it's particularly a challenging time to not be able to come together physically in the normal way that we would to respect the customs that we have in communities at this time and my condolences and my heart goes out to this community and to the family as we continue to move forward in our covert 19 response it's important that we don't leave anyone behind particularly people who I know are dealing with many different crises including people who use drugs people who are under housed and homeless everyone in DC deserves to feel safe protected and supported through these crises safe physical distancing and self isolation if you're ill can be really difficult when your housing is precarious and this is further compounded for people who may also be living with mental health and substance use or addiction issues we have not forgotten that we have two public health crises two public health emergencies that we're dealing with in this province the first of those has been going on for some time and that is our overdose crisis and now compounding that is the covert 19o break for people who are dealing with both of these challenges daily life can be a very much a struggle today the province announced over a thousand hotel rooms to provide safe housing for people living in accountant's in Victoria and Vancouver and a plan and importantly a plan to support people in housing but also to ensure that they have the mental health the physical health and the social supports that they need and that we need so that we can support people who are living with mental health and substance use issues with addictions and with homelessness we cannot address kovat 19 in isolation and we need to make sure that we're supporting those people who are the most vulnerable in our communities this action is welcome news it reduces the immediate health and safety risks that we know we're a challenge for people living in these encampments and it's important for us in the health sector to be sure that we can support all of the needs of people as they are transitioned into more stable and important housing over the coming days weeks but also the months and years to come this is not a short-term plan and we in the health sector will be providing supports to our people in our communities and going for I also from the outset have spoken about the importance of keeping safe physical distance from others and staying home when ill these are the best and the most important things we can do to bend the Cova 19 curve but in many cases this has led to increase family stresses and decrease community connections and unfortunately for some being at home being at home means not being safe we know domestic violence intimate partner violence and Inter family violence can sometimes increase during crises like this one if you are experiencing violence it's not okay and we want you to know that you are not alone there are resources that are out here that we have that are available for you if you are in immediate danger call 911 and get the help you need you can also call victim Lindt link BC it's a toll-free confidential and multilingual telephone service that's available across British Columbia 24 hours a day seven days a week train support teams can give you the information and refer you that for the two services that you may need your immediate safety is more important than physical distancing or self I salacious and that is important for people to recognize there is help out there for you and we can connect you to what to the supports that you need there is more information about this on the BC CDC website but people can also as I said connect with victim a victim link BC you can call one eight hundred five six three zero eight zero eight or email victim link BC at BC - 1 1 dot CA there's also more information on the BC CDC website about how you can text or send notes if you're not in a safe position to call please know that these supports are out there for you we will get through this this is a challenging time and it's becoming complicated for all of us and I know people are tired and sometimes this can be lead to two stressors that we may not know how to deal with we will get through this and we'll be stronger by taking care of our loved ones and taking care of each other we need to continue to be kind to each other to be calm through this crises and to stay safe thank you and I'm happy to take questions thank you a friendly reminder to everybody on the phone please press star 1 to enter the queue you are limited to one question please also unmute your phones you will not be audible until we call your name first question today is from John Hernandez CBC go ahead John hi dr. Henry can you just comment on how things got so maybe out of hand at the mission institution because this has sort of been on the problems is radar for a number of days and also just given the amount of outbreaks we're seeing you know the outbreak at mission institution poultry plants what will it take for us to kind of manage some of these new and emerging outbreaks get a hold on these types of things yeah so with the first one from the very beginning we knew it was going to be a challenge with the the federal correctional facility it's a it's a very difficult environment to affectively isolate people who are ill from others and we know that that some have been part of the issue one of the reasons why we're seeing the increased numbers today however is over the last few days we have been systematically testing all of the inmates and any of their staff who are have any symptoms at all so we've been looking at if we can find people with minimal or asymptomatic or minimal symptoms for the most part and so that's why we're seeing that during that big jump today I think we are making headway in dealing with this issue there currently only two inmates who are in hospital that that's at this time but it is a very challenging virus and it reflects how difficult it is to to effectively isolate people who are sick within that type of an environment and so we're hopeful that with these new measures with the new infection prevention and control measures that have been put in place in this facility that we're able to support everybody who's in the facility and make sure that ongoing transmission is stopped but we know with the the incubation period being up to two weeks that it's going to take some time before we see whether that has been effective or not with regards to the poultry outbreaks you know I think it really also reflects the fact that we have a more sensitive testing in our community so the fact that we picked these up and that we were able to detect these outbreaks is a is a good thing in a sense if they had continued to grumble along without us noticing we would have had more broader transmission in the community so that's where it's really important now for anybody who has symptoms that might be related to Kover 19 to connect with eight one one to call your health care provider to call Public Health to isolate yourself and go for an assessment and a test if it's needed next question is from Angela Jung CTV hi there thanks for taking my question my question is about P PE there's a new survey and it's found that people working in long-term care homes are still filled that they don't have enough PPE that the supply would only last about three days what's your response to that yeah you know it is a very challenging thing as we've talked about it's a it's a worldwide global phenomenon to try and get the appropriate protective equipment in and yes for most of our long-term care homes and many of the even the acute care wards depending on what's being used we are only able to provide a three to five days supply as we get more personal protective equipment in and as we test it to ensure that it meets the standards that we need we hope to be able to increase that but we do we are confident too that as a province we have enough to last us for the foreseeable future but we need to be very careful in how we measure it out to the different sectors so that can be I know quite distressing for people thinking that it might not be replenished in in two days or three days but I believe we have a good system now for ensuring that that happens and I can reassure people that we continue to get PPE in and that we will continue to distribute it and as much as we can over the next few weeks to months and and as things stabilize we'll be able to provide longer-term supplies for for long term care and other settings next is bethlehem maryam nias 11:30 hi dr. Henry thanks for taking my question you touched on this a little bit with ten communities about to be cleared out can you talk about some of the challenges that you see happening I know it's volunteer until mid-may you talk about challenges sure and you know this is this is not and this is not something that we have this is something we have been dealing with for in some cases many years since the the overdose crises really started it's been something my office has been working with and our Health Authority partners have been working with with many different parts of ministries to try and address these issues and right now it's the public safety concerns in the encampments that we're seeing but it's a broader initiative from our perspective to support people who are under housed or homeless who are dealing with many other challenging issues and you know from a Health Authority perspective on the ground these are people we know that we've been working with for quite a long time many of them are our community they have very individual needs there are indigenous people who are part of this there are women who have specific needs there are families who are together so that is the focus that we have in the health sector to try and support people to get into a safer space for themselves where they're able to better care for themselves but it has to be done in a way that allows those those health and social supports to be there for people as well so that this transition is is thoughtful and gradual and does the best that we can to support people I realize it's going to be challenging and we're going to have to monitor things carefully and you know I've been talking many well for with many of my colleagues we've been planning for this I think it's an important step forward and and importantly it's not just putting people in a place for the next couple of weeks it's about a long-term strategy that we can support people to get into supportive housing to get the supports they need long-term and it's focusing right now of course on on the acute issues that our public safety issues in in Vancouver and here in Victoria but these will be initiatives to address the issues that we've been working on for a long time in many other communities around the province as well and and for that I I think it's a it's a really important step forward for us as a in public health but also across government to support people who are homeless or under house to have mental health and substance use issues and and I'm really I think it's a it's an important initiative that's going to lead to long-term sustained support in this area and for that I think it's a I'm very grateful for that one Palmer Bank to her son the day dr. Henry back to mission I would note that when there was an outbreak at a provincial Correctional Facility the province appears to me to have acted very quickly capped it off and I'm just wondering is this situation at mission partly failure on the part of the federal agency either they didn't know what they were dealing with early enough or they didn't take enough steps quickly enough or they didn't call on the province for help because it looks to me like there's a very different narrative between the two facilities well it's very challenging there's there's different circumstances in the facilities as well I mean this is a medium-security facility that the types of accommodations and living in it are different people are there for a longer period of time there's a lot of turnover in our provincial correctional facilities and it is always challenging we you know by the time the outbreak was recognized in in Mission we were already behind in playing catch up around it as we know people can transmit when they have very mild symptoms and it may not have been recognized early enough we've had some challenges as we've talked about in some of our coordination and communication between Frazer health and the province and Correctional Services Canada I know everybody is meaning to do their best on this but being able to put in place all of the infection prevention and control measures and and my kudos really go to Fraser health who have been actively in the facility supporting the teaching and and the importance of infection control everything from wearing masks to enhance cleaning and how that can be done in an effective way so these were all things that we needed to reach out and find the resources and the protocols to develop I have been in contact with my counterparts from Correctional Services Canada from the medical side from very early on and it is sometimes a challenge when you have different ways of doing things and finding those seamless connections for things like people who have been discharged or being released from the facility to make sure that we're notified in BC so that we can support people who were close contacts to make sure that they are isolated and they have what they need to take care of themselves through the incubation period so it has been a challenging process I'm not going to sugarcoat it and it's a very challenging thing to be able to support people who are in that type of a communal setting and to try and prevent transmission of infection Sara McDonald's Global News hey there dr. Henry you mentioned the spike in cases at correctional institutions we now know a fugitive who had being in a federal prison in California where we know prisoners were released early because of Koba 19 has been extradited to Canada can you just walk us through this process if you can we know he was escorted back to Canada by RCMP members we believe through why they are so will this individuals be isolated for two weeks and if so where and what's the protocol here when it comes to bringing home a prisoner who has to be isolated obviously I'm assuming you don't want to put him in with the general population at this point coming back in California so I don't have any knowledge of this specific case that you're talking about and you know but I can tell you in general anybody who's coming into the province right now has to have an approved self-isolation plan and we have facilities that we can do that effectively so we have people who are being isolated in in hotels that are run by us in the province there's also federal isolation and quarantine facilities so presumably this would be fall under the federal jurisdiction and they would be again they would have to to come back to BC have an appropriate isolation plan and would be quarantined and supported to be quarantined in one of our facilities and this is something that we've been we've put in place for a couple of weeks now since the 10th of April and it's been very effective at ensuring that everybody who's come back to British Columbia and that people like our temporary foreign workers and we've had about a thousand of temporary foreign workers from Mexico who have come back - these are come to BC to work and they are being quarantined in facilities here in in BC and and I can say that we've had at least three people who've ended up being positive for covin 19 in our quarantine facilities and they're being cared for and and that's exactly what this was designed to do so we do have processes in place and my expectation is that anybody coming into the province will fit into those processes next question is from kathy smith fort nelson is good afternoon dr. Henry there's been some speculation that some US military personnel have not been self isolating upon entering BC before actually traveling the province to get to their postings in Alaska or back to the continental US for the next postings and of course on their journey through BC they in hotels and services just like anybody else would have to with the expense of the province and small remote communities like for Snelson which happens to be on the Alaska Highway are not equipped to handle an outbreak so I'm wondering can you please clarify the requirements that are specific to u.s. military entering BC and how this is overseen no I can't I don't know what the requirements are for specifically for US military so I could get back to you on that one I will tell you that any non-essential travel it has been turned back at the border there are many ways that people get to Alaska not just driving through BC although that may be one way and so I don't have knowledge about US military specifically we do have processes in place for any of the essential workers who are coming back and forth across the border which include self monitoring having isolation when you're in when you're at home so that you are not out and about in the community as we know and that we have provisions to support people in doing that lissa core desk och oh why thank you very much um can you tell me how many or if there is any role being played in like that we're seeing the numbers to travel that may have occurred over the Easter weekend yeah very difficult but not that we can tell most of the people that are in the cases particularly the ones we've talked about today are related to ongoing community outbreaks that we know about including the number of outbreaks both related to the poultry plant and the correctional facilities so I'm not aware of any increase particularly in small communities for example the Gulf Islands or other places related to the Easter weekend travel next question is from brush D bath sue Victoria buzz go ahead my question can you put how exactly will the number of new outbreaks affect the timeline for eating restrictions like is there a cut-off point or a number of new cases or outbreaks at which you'll consider delaying lifting some of the restrictions that were originally planned yeah so there's no exact number it's it's understanding what's happening in our community across the province understanding the outbreaks that we know about and how they're evolving making sure that we have the surveillance in place to recognize things early both individual cases but also anybody who is part of a cluster of a case so those are the the things that we've been talking about around our enhanced testing protocol now or a change in our testing protocol so that anybody with symptoms gets tested that we have still surveillance for any respiratory illness that automatically gets tested for kovat 19 as well and we've expanded our ability to have testing in some of the more remote areas of the province so it is very much dependent on us decreasing the numbers of new cases and new outbreaks and we do consider for example the 40 cases related to mission don't change my my assessment our assessment of where we are in terms of the pandemic trajectory in BC so we do take those things into account we still want to see a decrease in cases we've been sort of grumbling along at a certain level for the last few weeks which is not surprising given the way that we didn't have explosive growth at the beginning so we flattened it enough that we would expect it to to continue a little bit longer than and some of the places where you might have a dramatic peak having said that we do want to see the numbers come down the fact that we are picking up these outbreaks is important because that tells us that our surveillance is working and that's something that's also important so there is no date I can give yet next question comes from Hina alum Canadian Press hi dr. Henry hope you doing okay I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the whe report today which says people who have recovered don't have immunity so what does this mean for herd immunity for social distancing and reopening the economy it's interesting I think that was taken a little bit out of context dr. Kirk Ovens remarks I think what they were talking about was how we don't yet know whether people have immunity or how long that immunity would last and that is that is true and we've said that many times we do however have other respiratory viruses like SARS like other corona viruses that circulate that give us some idea that people probably do have immunity if we have antibodies and that's where that testing the antibody testing is so important that we have immunity for a period of time what that period of time is we don't yet know and that's where the challenges this is such a new virus we don't know if it's going to behave exactly like other coronaviruses we've seen some differences in the behavior in terms of it can be transmitted quite early on in illness where other the SARS for example from 2003 we didn't see that until later on so there's things that we don't yet know and the part of the challenge is the antibody tests that we have there are not many of them out there that are people are working on but there they have not yet been validated so we're not sure yet about the false positives or the false negatives and what that means so it is very challenging when we have something new like this too to say anything for certain I I think given what I've read and all of the science and the papers that we've all been scouring over the last few weeks that it's very likely will have some immunity we don't see this virus changing as quickly as things like influenza for example so I would expect that if people have antibodies it would be protective for a period of time but what that period of time is I don't know I don't yet know and I don't think anybody does and and that is what my understanding of what was being reflected by the w-h-o comments next question is from Li Zi used to news 11:30 Lisa okay moving on Moira wit inanity hi good afternoon dr. Henry thank you for your briefing I'm hearing health care workers and public private nonprofit facilities who say they haven't heard anything from employers or government or their unions about how the new staffing orders you announced about a month ago are impacting their work and their pay I'm wondering if you have an update on the status of the staffing change what information you could give these workers we're saying but they're still in the dark well I can only say that there is ongoing work being done on that and certainly in some areas it's already been settled it may be that people are not they may have missed some communication from their unions there's also a good proportion of people who aren't affected by it in that they've only worked at one facility so it may the focus really is on people who have been working at more than one facility for the time and it may be that the job that they are doing is not one of the ones where there has needed to be a change in in the pay scale for example so it's hard to tell what the initiatives are what the issues are with them individuals but I will say it definitely is progressing it's been further ahead in Vancouver Coastal as we said before Fraser health are very complicated in the Lower Mainland because people work across both health authorities so those people who were working in more than one facility are the ones that are going to see the changes and be affected by this most and earliest but I do fully expect everybody will have a better understanding as the as the week's go by next question is from Leslie Evans Ogden go ahead I think there Henry for speaking with us today you've heated Levi's dish Colombians while especially disciplining to take care of mental health by getting out into the outdoors for exercise but provincial parks across the province have been closed and even places like Pacific Rim National Park with miles and miles of open beaches seemingly ideal for physical distancing are close to this potentially funnels higher concentrations of people into narrow linear trails and city and regional parks that do remain open is there a plan for conversation and better coordination between parks and public health to allow for safe use of parks for safe outdoor exercise absolutely and I think there's a number of reasons as I've mentioned before why provincial parks were closed part of it has to do with you know social distancing and the concerns about use of facilities on parks but really a lot of it has well to do with our forest fire risk and the flooding risk that we're seeing now which has started in this season and being able to balance the need to respond to those many different concerns around parks and as you say it's it's not done on a park by park basis having said that yes we are looking at how we can open up the parks in a safe way as we start to transition to our new normal and we're also talking with the federal government around federal parks and how they can be managed in a safe way for the future as well so we have time for one more question this afternoon for any reporters that didn't get to ask a question there will be a statement release later this afternoon for recommendations on protecting families and communities from kovat 19 visit bcc DCCA for now medical questions about the provinces kovat 19 response visit gov dot BCC a forward slash Cove at 19 and for a full listing of the provincial health officers orders visit gov be ca /ph oak items last question is from chad paulsen CBC go ahead Chad yeah hi dr. Henry can you talk a little bit more about any Kovan 19 wards and hospitals that are looking at transitioning at this time so that elective surgeries can restart yeah so we're looking at it in a whole system way there are still particularly the intensive care units and in a number of hospitals have numbers of cases in them but we're looking at transitions and because when when you when you start elective surgeries you have to use the post anesthetic recovery rooms and the operating rooms which were all part of our strategy for surge capacity should we need it in intensive care so how to ramp those up in a way that is thoughtful and systematic is the work that others are doing including Michael March bankers you've heard about so yes the those are part of the strategies we're looking at how do we have SEP separate spaces for kovat 19 both critical care spaces and regular hospital beds and wards and be able to essentially have those cohorted so that everything else in the hospital can go on as well we're also talking about you know the strategies about reducing the numbers of hospitals that take kovat patients as the numbers decrease so that you can ramp up more fully in other facilities recognizing of course that we are not yet out of the woods entirely and we can still see the explosive outbreaks that are happening in our community and you know we've been relatively lucky in that we've caught some of these early but we can't let down low let go our guard yet we see in Alberta we've seen in Ontario as well that these can become very large very quickly so we need to need to hold the line right now but those are all the planning that is going in to our reopening particularly healthcare services really important and diagnostic services that have been put on hold and we'll be spending more time and talking about that week that's all the time we have for today thank you very much thank you very much
