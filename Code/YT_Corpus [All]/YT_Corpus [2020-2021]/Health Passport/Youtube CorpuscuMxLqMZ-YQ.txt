 hi my name is dr Kevin Clive i am a bariatric surgeon at CHI Franciscan we really emphasize overall health goals in managing the whole person the conversation does not start with this is how much weight you can plan to lose it starts with this is how your quality of life is going to change i actually do most of my procedures robotically which is a form of laparoscopy i've found that it translates into better outcomes i think that those patients clearly have a benefit in terms of their length of stay their pain their risk for having complications related to incisional hernias the patients perceive that outcome basically on how they feel and how quickly they get back to their daily lives i think it's the relationship that i get to build with the patient i get to see how their lives change for the better i get to see the impact that they have on on their family members and their loved ones it's overwhelming and so that's that's what really drew me to bariatric surgery
