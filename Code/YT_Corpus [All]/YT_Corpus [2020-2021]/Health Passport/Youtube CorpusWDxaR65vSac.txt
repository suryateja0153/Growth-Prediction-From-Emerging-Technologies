 good afternoon I'm Hadrian Dix BC Minister of Health to my right is dr. Bonnie Henry bc's provincial health officer it's international war nurses day today we wish everyone well and we want to recognize and honor the territory of the Klingon speaking people of the seunggi's and the Esquimalt First Nations and with that I'll introduce dr. Henry for today's covered 19 update thank you good afternoon so per day for today May 12th I'm pleased that we have only seven new cases who have tested positive in British Columbia today and that brings our total to two thousand three hundred and sixty people who have tested positive in the province including 874 in the Vancouver Coastal Health Region 1124 people in the Fraser Health Region 125 people in Vancouver Island Health Region 180 people in the interior health region and 57 people in the northern Health Region we continue to have outbreaks as you're aware in long term care and assisted living we have no new outbreaks to report and we are up to 482 people who are associated with long-term care assisted living or the number of acute care units that we have outbreaks ongoing including 295 residents and 187 staff we also have no new community outbreaks to report today so in terms of our cases we have 397 active cases around the province today and you will excuse my slight mathematical error yesterday when I reported 600 and some we were at 504 yesterday so that has decreased by a little over a hundred active cases again today of those 63 people are in hospital and 16 are in critical care or ICU we have unfortunately one additional death to report bringing our total to 100 31 people who have died from covert 19 NBC and this is unfortunately another resident of our long-term care home in the Fraser Health Region and our condolences go to the families in the community and the care providers for this person we now have one thousand eight hundred and thirty two people who have fully recovered and covered 19 today I want to bring people's attention to one of the initiatives that we've talked about a little bit in that we have done a number of things to try and understand the unintended consequences of the measures that we have had to take to try and control kovat 19 in British Columbia as we know everybody in this province has been impacted and everybody across the country and around the globe has been impacted the effects have been far-reaching and we have learned a lot we have learned a lot about the virus we have learned a lot about transmission we learned a lot about how to care for people how to manage outbreaks but there are still many many questions that we still need to answer and understand so today we have Lawton launched a province ride survey to gather your feedback on your experiences and your actions in the Cova 19 pandemic so far here in British Columbia this is a collaboration with all of our medical health officers our public health officers around the province the provincial health services authority as well as my office and the information that we gather will help inform the decisions that we make in the weeks and months ahead as part of the survey there's also an opportunity for you to express your interest in participating in a number of other studies that we are setting up to try and better understand the impact of the pandemic on people here in British Columbia including a serology blood testing a study to determine immunity in British Columbia and I know that will appeal to a lot of people so I encourage you to look at this survey the other study that we're looking at is getting your advice and support about how we could use technology to coordinate information sharing and contact tracing going forward in British Columbia so this survey of your experiences and helping us to understand the impact it's had on you and your family is available on the BC CDC website so that's BCC DCC a back slash kovat 19 survey and I really encourage everybody if you have a few minutes it takes about 10 to 15 minutes I encourage you to make the time to complete this survey and help us understand your experiences so far as Minister Dixon noted today is International Nurses Day and that is the anniversary its celebrated on the anniversary of the birth of Florence Nightingale who was one of the first professional nurses and who started her own nursing school as many people are aware she was also somebody that I admire greatly as one of the first infection control providers that we've had in in the health care setting and her work during the Crimean War and helping make hospitals safer from infections and preventing infections in in patients and staff in those hospitals is really legendary she was also a statistician it was something I admire greatly today we know that bc's nurses are doing incredible work across our province supporting patients with kovat 19 stepping up in this crisis across the province whether they're public health nurses working in the community whether they're nurses in long term care in our hospital system across the sector we know that nurses in our communities are caring and compassionate and so much more and I want to take the opportunity today to recognize that and to thank you for all that you do one of the ways we can show appreciation to all of our health care providers but to the nurses in our community in our lives is to keep healthy ourselves protecting ourselves our loved ones our communities protects all of us including the nurses in our communities and I just want to say a small quote from Florence Nightingale as I said she's somebody that I'm an I admire greatly and she did say it may seem a strange principle to enunciate as the very first requirement in a hospital that it should do the sick no harm and I think that's an important thing for us all to remember when we're talking about the things that we need to do to prevent people from getting sicker when they're in hospitals and in particular to prevent the transmission of infections so thank you to all of the nurses in BC I know there is still concern as well about how we are going to safely transition into our Phase two here in BC and many are understandably keen to get back to work and just as many from the notes that I receive are fearful and they're concerned they're concerned that we're going to see a surge in cases that we're going to end up undoing the work that we have done but we need to all of us be thoughtful we are taking this slowly in our guidance and we're taking this slowly and how we're rolling out the phases and we need you to do that too the orders and restrictions that we have put in place are to keep all of us safe and that remains our number one priority I've talked many times about the principles that we've laid out and this remains all of our responsibilities as we as we move forward into the next phase we know that WorkSafeBC and the public health community are working on guidance for for a number of sectors and it's going to take us time to roll those out to support you in being able to move forward as as these orders are lifted so this is the new start of our new phase but it will take time and we will continue to be measured and thoughtful in how we do this we can safely restart our province and it is incredibly important that the heart of that is controlling this virus for us to to get our society moving again our economy moving again we need to maintain control of covert 19 so we all need to continue to do our part that means cleaning our hands regularly covering our mouths and wearing a non-medical mask in those places where we have to be in close contact with others per house it means keeping that safe distance in keeping our germs to ourselves it means staying home and away from others if you are sick and together we can make it through this we can continue to be safe we continue to be kind and to be calm and we will make it through into the next phase thank you very much dr. Henry I I wanted to first of all express enjoying dr. Henry expressing condolences to the family the friends the caregivers the community of the person who passed away from kovat 19 in Fraser Health in the last 24 hours this is we say it regularly but it always bears repeating a very very challenging time for all of us to grieve particularly in long-term care where it is the ability to contact one another and to be together isn't what it should be in normal circumstances and isn't what we would hope it to be but nonetheless all of us I think everyone the problems from the premiere to every person wants to express their condolences to the family as I do and to say that we are with them at this very very difficult moment today in terms of number of cases as a lo day in British Columbia there were seven cases that makes 2,360 in total as dr. Henry has said 63 of those hospitalized just to put that in context of 36 in Fraser health to an interior health one on Vancouver Island two in the northern Health Authority and 22 in Vancouver Coastal Health and 16 in critical care and in our hospital system and you can see this in the numbers over the last few days our number of beds available include the extra beds we've added especially in critical care in this time are 3760 empty beds but occupancy is up to sixty six point three percent occupancy and critical care is still under fifty percent at forty six point two percent what shows some of the return to normalcy that's going on in the hospital system and this is this just is is the 5350 for visits to emergency rooms that a hospitals across BC received yesterday this is the highest numbers since March as you'll recall March 9th which is about a typical number there but there was sixty five hundred and fifty nine visits that was reduced to two thousand nine hundred ninety five visits on April 6th and we are now significantly above even the 4545 to forty six hundred we've been in the last number of days and that reflects I think was a return to a little bit of normalcy in the healthcare system and that people are feeling confident about visiting the emergency room and if they need to be in an emergency room we've made significant advances in virtual care I think even in this period but if they need to go to the emergency room there's a place for them there tomorrow I'll be updating everyone both the numbers of urgent surgeries that have taken place during this pandemic and also an update on the progress we've made in contacting people around BC since we relaunched the surgery plan last week I wanted to join doctor Henry and and encouraging people to take part in the survey seeking input from citizens on the response to kovat 19 surveys called your story our future and it shows what we've known from the beginning which is that your story and your efforts and everyone's effort in BC has had a lot to do with the results and a lot to do with our immediate future it'll help us gather valuable information about how code 19 has impacted the people of BC and will also assist us as we continue to deal with this in the days and the days and weeks and months and indeed years to come local data are essential for communities for public health planning and equipped our medical hot team of medical health officers across BC to support health and well-being as we learned and live with Kovac 19 it takes about 15 minutes online it's just one more step that you can take to help your fellow citizens your community your healthcare system to respond in these difficult times we always need to learn that's what we've discovered regularly both from dr. Henry and myself to everyone the system we need to learn and prepare for the future and you can help us do this but we want to repeat the where you can take the survey online it's at BCC DC dot C a backslash Kovac 19 survey is currently available in English simplified Chinese and Punjabi for those of you who cannot complete the survey online or need assistance in another language you can take the survey over the phone you can call one eight three three seven oh seven nineteen hundred seven days a week between 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. assistance is available in 150 languages and as dr. Henry has said at the end of the survey you'll be asked about your interest in taking part in to future initiatives 1a serology survey to help determine immunity across the population and there is a considerable interest in that and the planning for digital tools that will help identify and manage kovat 19 infections in your community in the future and I encourage everyone to take part in that I wanted to also bring you up to date on the issue of PPE which we've done every Tuesday we're continuing to make sure that healthcare workers have the PPE they need to protect themselves each other and their patients as the previous Tuesday's I want to update you and where we were as of last Tuesday which includes over a three million 750,000 and 95 respirators and I want to note that 63,000 of those are from the federal government's VOC procurement over 3 million surgical masks which are our efforts plus 146,000 from the federal government procurement close to 1 million pieces of eye protection of which 44,000 are from the federal government's both caring for care almost six million pairs of gloves and several hundred thousand gowns today I can tell you since that time was since last Tuesday we've received an additional 44,000 3m and 95 respirators 85,000 alternate brand n95 respirators which are as noted before subject to testing three hundred and twenty four thousand surgical mass over five million pairs of gloves close to a hundred thousand pieces of eye protection and over five hundred thousand gowns as always any project product we receive that isn't from a previous vendor will be tested and assessed before it gets into the healthcare system we are also testing any alternative n95 respirators received from the federal government beyond our testing process we're keeping very close contact with Health Canada and other jurisdictions as they receive PPE and test it we're sharing information so that we can help each other to know to know more about which vendors and poor products are acceptable once again I'm able to say the BC is testing and establishing a contingency of alternative products we have not had to put alternative products into the healthcare system at this point with the decline of Kovan 19 and BC we believe we'll be in good shape to continue to protect our healthcare workers with the steady supply we've received from our traditional familiar vendors I want to just on two further points thank dr. Henry and my colleague Emily norm let Nick for a very successful virtual town hall last night we had close to 30,000 people tuned in to the call which is great and it's a real reflection of the of the assistance and the work that MLA let Nick nor let Nick the liberal health critic has made and contributed as has the green health critics on you first to know to our efforts in BC I wanted to say finally that getting positive results here getting a reduction in the number of cases is of course something that we're satisfied with even pleased with when it happens but it doesn't happen every day over the last week we've also seen the modeling data has shown our progress in the Cova 19 fight we shared our four phase plan to restart BC and seen the commitment to surgery renewal we are preparing for the weeks and months ahead and the promise they offer for social surgical and economic renewal but just to be clear we cannot we just cannot get ahead of ourselves the only travel we should be doing the next little while really is moving from phase 1 to phase 2 because covin 19 isn't going anywhere it's still in every health region in BC and we can't make that trip from phase 1 to phase 2 without our passport to safety the skills that we've learned the skills we've been taught to keep healthy and to stop the ship the spread of Kovac 19 this means that every step we take along the path to our social and economic renewal this week this coming along weekend and beyond begins with this commitment we wash our hands and coffin sneeze into our sleeves and we use where appropriate a mask a non-medical mask follow the rules flatten the curve for BC's restart plan and surgical rule renewal to fully deliver on their promise we must continue to be 100% committed to stopping the spread at every step of the way in our journey through our through this summer and beyond OSHA wins on a sunset new volca from total denial transposon card covetousness uncle and every technique you some safely state announce a new vote they say Li AO covetousness Donna resident a new Fraser from total the Sun 20 they say on Columbia technique news Oprah the amount on the new condolence to su-kyong Purdue law brush per meal and sound account confirming the covetousness wasn't was on actual Hospital is a don't says on swans Anton sieve Rizzo Pearson don't attested EP stash at the positive certainly easel not a lot of domiciled for happy to take your question thank you reminder to everybody on the phone please press star-1 to enter the queue you are limited to one question please also unmute your phones you will until I call your name first question today is from penny deaf low C TV thank you so much for taking my question we Phase two around the corner and the idea of expanding our bubbles I'm here a lot of single people who've been very lonely some of them maybe just feeling frisky they're thinking about dating again so just want to hear what is dr. Henry's advice when it comes to sex and dating and will we start seeing some public health messaging around that because I think there's a lot of confusion concern are people still allowed to see each other in other jurisdictions say kissing is the highest risk so any any help that you could offer the single people in particular I think is would be appreciated yeah I know it's that it's an incredibly challenging time for all of us and when we don't have already made people within our bubble it can be even more lonely and I think many people have adapted I know to online and to talking online into having encounters online that can be quite quite helpful in that regard I would say you know now's the time that we need to be careful we're not out of that place we're coming together in large groups isn't is is going to be safe for a while but yes we can look at how do we connect with people those people that we have been talking to online these are our opportunities but we need to to be very careful about it and cautious about it and and make sure that we do follow the the concerns that the guidance around you know cleaning our hands etc I think the really important thing and you know I I'm I'm laughing a little bit because I'm thinking of some of the young people in my life who were who are concerned about missing some of the occasions that they might meet others and yeah we can do that we have to do that we're social people we need that but let's do it in small thoughtful ways and also let's be really concerned about ourselves and if we are feeling unwell or under the weather put it off for another day that's the really important thing right now I also will say that you know we've seen lots of people outside and one of the people that I in my life remarked to me that now that we can't go to bars and clubs and things going out to the park and sitting at a distance and having picnics you know those are the new romantic things people are doing and you know that's an okay thing too so let's find those opportunities to meet each other safely and if you happen to pull somebody else that have find somebody that you want to spend more clothes time with and make it make it to your own connections thank you next question is from Rob Shaw Vancouver son oh hi dr. Henry Washington State has proposed on a mandated actually that if a restaurant is gonna real but it has to keep a daily log of all the customers their telephone and email contact information and keep that for 30 days to help with contact tracing if there's an outbreak is that something you would expect to see here in DC you know that is something that we've seen in other situations so you know we have those requirements for places like you know massage places spas other places where you can understand who the customers have been I think that's a really good idea I haven't seen the details of the the Vesey Restaurant Association proposals but that type of thing that helps us understand who might have been in close contact with others is something that's important to help assist us going forward so I think that's a really good idea next question is from Tonya Fletcher CBC oh hi dr. Henry I'm you touched on this a little bit yesterday but with more jurisdictions mandating the use of masks while out in public you stayed away from making that a formal recommendation before you seem to be more in favor of that now and many of your guidelines to sectors include wearing a mask business is beginning to reopen some are requiring customers to wear masks others are not or you can concern there might be confusing or inconsistent messaging around that yeah I really don't believe we should be requiring it there are many reasons why some people cannot wear a mask of face covering people who have certain respiratory illnesses it can be very challenging and can cause breathing problems etc and we know that it's not possible for young children so I do think it is something that we can do particularly short-term for those periods where we can't maintain those distances and it may be crowded the most more important thing is if you are somebody who has challenges wearing a mask or who has respiratory illness you know avoiding those situations finding so we need to have those sort of layers that allow us to do things safely so if I'm somebody for that is at higher risk of having illness wearing a mask is not something I'm able to do then maybe I go in the early mornings when there's special hours for people who are who are seniors or more at risk so those are the types of things we need to think through and yeah it's a it is challenging as I mentioned before our thinking around the value of non-medical mass has changed and it's changed globally although I will say you know we need to remind people that it's actually not for my protection that I'm wearing one it is to keep my secretions in so if I'm able to do that and to make sure that I can cover my mouth and clean my hands and not get close to people then you know for most situations it's not needed it is in many cultures a sign of respect and I think that's important too so we shouldn't be stigmatizing people either for wearing them or for not wearing them as long as we're able to maintain our our safe distances and the other measures that are important to be put in place so the bottom line is it is a measure it's not the most effective measure we have to prevent transmission and there are some situations where it may be useful and so that's where we are right now and are thinking about it and so we do recommend it in those situations for those who are able to do that I think the other really of course important thing is to to stay back and stay away from others if you're sick at all next is farhan lousy TSM hi dr. Henry thanks for taking my question it's for regarding the possibility of the NHL coming to Vancouver and British Columbia as a Hub City to restart play another Premier Horrigan is going to be speaking to NHL commissioner Gary Bettman tomorrow from your end of things how concerned are you that if the NHL does come to Vancouver that it might put some undue stress on the medical system particularly as it pertains to testing available for the general public and also another league official has suggested that if one positive test came back it wouldn't necessarily shut the whole thing down do you see that as feasible yeah so you know there's a lot of ifs around this you know in in theory I think it's a really great idea of course it will depend on timing where we are in our phases I also think that that I would need to see a very detailed plan of what their expectations are how they will meet our requirements right now there's no changes that we are seeing in requirements for self isolation for people who've come into BC from outside the country so that would need to be taken into account the ability to monitor to care for people to make sure that testing is available and it would be part of my criteria that it would not have any impact on our ability to test here in BC or for anybody in British Columbia to to get the testing the assessment or the care that they need so we do need to monitor it very carefully I have not yet seen a proposal that of the those types of details so I think it is very much in that theoretical phase right now but you know I think we could look at the probabilities and the possibilities if and when they come forward with a proposal he's ball three Global News hi dr. Henry and mr. Dix he mentioned travel earlier on the weekend the Port of Vancouver official was quoted as saying they're making preparations to welcome cruise ships on July 1st a prospect I'm sure neither of you agree with it is a federal port are you of the view or in terms of talk to the federal to ensure that cruise ships do not come in or do you have any power over that yes we've had those conversations with our counterparts in the federal government we are as you can imagine not in favor of cruise ships coming in to anywhere in British Columbia and I can tell you that my conversations with my counterparts both in the Yukon but also in Alaska and Washington state are similarily not expecting to have cruise ships in in our waters or in our ports in the coming weeks and months so yes that is not something one of the things as I've just mentioned is the requirement for anybody coming into the province from from outside of BC from outside of the country will need to self isolate for 14 days so if a cruise ship had somehow planned to come here then we would not be allowing people to come off the cruise ship for example so you know those are things that we need to work out this is not the time for that type of a risk to be taken in our province and certainly not in our ports either Vancouver or Victoria or you know Prince Rupert some of the other places where these cruise ships have gone in the past so I do expect the federal government will be looking at the issue and coming out with their recommendations but the orders that we have in place here in British Columbia will stand through certainly through the July 1st and just to say just as dr. Henry has and with colleagues in both Alaska and Washington State and then across the country I think we've been pretty clear on this point you'll recall back before really the beginning of March we suggested that this was not the year to be going on cruise ships I think all of the evidence shows that that was at least one correct piece of advice of hopefully more but one correct piece of advice that people shouldn't at that time get on cruise ships I don't think anything substantially has changed and I don't think I think if people are planning that kind of travel I know there are many people who are dedicated fans of cruise ships and going on cruise ship vacations that really I think all of the evidence tells you this is not the summer for that that the rules that we are applying to every one will apply to cruise ship passengers as well and I don't see anything happening with respect to cruise ships starting on July 1st except a continuation of the present situation next question I will note as well that there are still Canadians and others who have when working on cruise ships who continue to remain an unable to dock in in places around the world and so the you know the whole challenge that we have had about infections of Cova 19 and cruise ships continues and is not yet resolved from from the previous months next question is from Marshall a Bernard Oh News 11:30 I'm going to try to sneak in to questions if I can first to dr. Henry it wasn't long ago that I asked you about wet markets and that's making headlines again in the news just how concerned are you about the opening up of wet markets in in the world not just in China but all over the world and also for both of you if you can talk about the border control the film industry has been asking for possibility of easing up border regulations for isolation so that especially actors don't have to wait two weeks to isolate themselves when they need to work on a projects only a couple of days has there been any discussion about possibly eating up restrictions for that kind of work yeah so in in terms of wet markets I think we there's a couple of things around them they are markets that have been traditionally around the world in many different countries as you mentioned and we still have some ability for small numbers of live animals chickens for example in some communities here in BC to be used at home and slaughtered at home so they are very much a source of food for many communities and they is how people get access to to protein and to other foods I think there's a difference between that type of market and the illegal trade in exotic animals for food which is a very different thing often happens around the same places and it may be that a number of particularly illegal trade happens through the the facility of a wet market but we have seen in many countries in the world that if you put in the appropriate infection prevention and control measures in wet markets they can be very safe so I think there's two things that need to be dealt with and in particular the illegal trade in exotic animals for food or for other measures is something that needs to be looked at and in my mind there needs to be restrictions and put in place around that and that is a very challenging thing to do in terms of yeah the borders you know right now we do not foresee I do not foresee lifting those restrictions on self-isolation we need to go through this next phase we need to look at where we are come you know the end of June into the summer and see what measures can be put in place I think we're right now the only thing that I see at the borders that we need to address is is looking at how we can facilitate family reunification but again I I would see that in the context of people having to self isolate when they come here as things improve both in the United States and in Canada and then we can look at having different conversations around the need for self isolation but that we're not at that place yet and if we look at people coming in from other places around the world we still have travel related cases we've had Canadians repatriated from cruise ships as I've mentioned but also from a number of countries around the world that continued to be dealing with large numbers of cases of kovat 19 and they have developed their illness once they've come here to BC so we're not at the place where we can think about lifting those types of safety measures at this point next question is from Cindy her net times colonists hi um this question kind of follows on the last the the Prime Minister wouldn't say again today whether he'll extend restrictions on non-essential travel to the US after May 21st so what is BC's concern on that front minister dick she said that you might be talking with provincial counterparts last night and maybe what came up that last night just as the Premier have we made our position clear that that the prohibition on non-essential travel has to continue into the future and we've made that clear to the federal government I know they're working on it they work on those issues with the United States government in practical terms but it would be absolutely unacceptable after the enormous sacrifice people in BC have been placed to take this risk right now and just remind everyone today especially we are still in phase one of our response we are moving to phase two but the risk remains very high across the province and so we have to be prudent and this is one of the steps we strongly believe in it's why in British Columbia and British Columbia all alone I think right now there is the kind of enforcement and support for people self isolating who are returning to British Columbia and to Canada from outside of the country why we continue to do that why that which has been led by provincial public servants is so important to us because a we know that there have been cases of people who have come in those circumstances and have tested positive for kovat 19 and it's desirable that people do that while they're in South isolation and secondly it shows our commitment to the idea of stopping the spread in every way that we can so that's got to continue and we're hopeful and in supportive of the federal government's efforts to see that that continue but be seized position could not be more crystal clear it cannot change now next question is from moira Witten the Tyee hi good afternoon dr. Henry thank you so much for this update my question is about a letter that was released today from a coalition of a couple of dozen mental health and legal advocacy organizations hoping for more information about potential outbreaks or the discharge circumstances for patients and psychiatric units and facilities in the province are there any current or past outbreaks in these units and would there be a threshold you would report these if there were an outbreak in the future yeah so I am aware that there has been concerns about outbreaks particularly in psychiatric facilities in other countries there is there have been no cases that I'm aware of in any of our psychiatric units in British Columbia and certainly no oh pricks that were aware of and we do have important measures in place to protect everybody in all of our facilities but in particular recognizing the challenges that can be faced in in some of the unit's Awards that are dealing with people with both mental health and substance use issues so there are special provisions being made in those places to ensure that if needed people are tested that they can be isolated that people have the support that they need I know one of the challenging things of course has been that we have not allowed visitors and that can be very challenging and in for people who are are dealing with their mental health issues in a hospital setting and so it again goes to the importance and the value that our healthcare teams our nurses and physicians and aides in those settings are doing to support those people going through this unprecedented crises and having to deal with those issues of separation from supports as well lisa krone ASCO CHL why thank you I hope that both dr. Henry and Minister dick can respond to my question how concerned are you with the conspiracy theories related to Kovac 19 that are circulating on social media platforms and being played out in protests like the one in front of st. Paul's Hospital last Sunday and are there any steps that you're planning to push back against it or you just feel it but a fringe group that's very small and is best ignored yeah it's really challenging because there's a lot of stuff out there that has a bit of truthiness to it and I know people send me lots of things that they think are the conspiracies that you know there's there's a number of people who call themselves physicians in a number of different places particularly from the US who have been put out information that they believe shows things like it was comes from a lab clearly that staying at home somehow makes our immune systems weaker you know they're it's very challenging and one of the ways that I think is very important is the fact that we do come out here and provide you with the information and that we have I provide you with as much as we know and encourage people to go to reputable sources of information so the Health Canada website the public health agency of Canada RBC CDC website our sources of truth and you can go from there to other links that the BC government covert web page has information as well and one of theirs there's a number of people that have been trying to address some of the misinformation out there I think it behooves all of us to take a deep breath and when something comes out that is wildly out there and seems to be credible sometimes when we're not around our usual people when we're self isolating we don't have somebody to bounce those ideas off of we put it out on social media right away and and that's a way that we know we can connect with people and many people will be are looking for that reason looking for an answer that makes sense to them and we see that as well when people are going through the anxiety and the fear that something like a new outbreak of a new disease happens so I would just say you know that the mantra that I say all the time we need to be calm we need to take a deep breath take a good look at it look at some reputable sources of information and and that will help us find the right way forward through this I think one of the reasons we've read it we've given such regular briefings that we've delivered information when it's good news when it's more difficult news we've acknowledged the price of coded 19 and BC I think we should we should just reflect on that 131 people have passed away many people have suffered the very serious health difficulties that come with kovat 19 people have lost their work and so on I think we owe it to them to be respectful to be respectful of truth and to be straightforward with the evidence and that's what we're trying to do here I really encourage people not to encourage it even by reacting to people who are taking steps that are designed to produce a reaction I am very proud of British Columbia this is going to be a this is a long time behind us now it was it feels like a long time it was three or four months since we started since the emergency response took over 19 started in January in BC in that time people have come together people in the legislature have come together last night we hosted our event with normal ethnic we hosted events with Sonia first know from different parties and BC people have come together to provide the information to support each other in this time and there are always going to be people who want to pursue another agenda but I think what we have to think of is all those people have had their surgeries canceled all of those people who have not been able to see their loved ones all of those people who have had to struggle in self isolation and recover it from co-ed 19 to be true to them we have to be true to ourselves and continue to act to protect one another continue to follow not bend the rules continue to not to see this as an opportunity to do anything else but come together and support one another I'm very proud of our province in its response to it and I don't think the attention was paid to a very small number of people in BC frankly is necessarily warranted I think we've got all we've got to be careful not to in our reactions to things raise them up to my I think the truth is Lisa that we've seen an extraordinary response from BC and one that we can all be very proud of next is Richard Sussman Global News just a follow up on a few things from earlier in the call Minister Dix are you concerned about this perception out there this double standard for the NHL but while people are being told you know stay at home limit your contact there's thoughts of a big organization coming to British Columbia and bringing with it hundreds of people and to dr. Henry - the first question the kissing part is that something that people should be concerned about spreading the virus through kissing okay I got the easier question thanks for sure dad no I don't think so the what we're gonna do is when there's a plan if there's a plan and right now it's there's a lot of interest obviously for people who are fans of professional sports it's been a long time since the major leagues have operated since the Western Hockey League has operated since the baseball season you know all these things have happened so there's a lot of interest in this area but what's going to happen is that as in every other case as in every other industry you we have to assess real plans and work together to ensure that everybody is safe and that applies to the NHL is it applies to every single other organization and that's what's going to happen in DC and I'll turn it over to dr. Henry I will say you know I'm not going to compromise safety for any organization whether it's the NHL or anything else as much as I love hockey and I will say I missed the Victoria rain as well I hope to see you again sometime soon in terms of kissing yes absolutely this is a respiratory virus that spread through droplets so yes we've seen it with other diseases that can be spread this way so yes I would expect that if somebody was sick with it and they were kissing somebody else they could actually quite effectively pass it on that way so it is the close contact that that can happen so that's why I guess I didn't say it quite very caridy but if you are going to start a relationship with somebody this is not the time to do rapid serial dating okay so pick somebody see if it works and then take your time if you're going to be pulling them into your small circle then make sure that you're the only one in their circle as well and we talked about the contacts and the fact that the people I have contact with it means that I'm contacting their contacts too so if there's somebody who has been with a whole bunch of other people then my risk would go up that and they might be infected with this and we know that people can transmit it early on in their illness when they're not realizing they're sick themselves so I think we all need to take a little bit of responsibility right now coming into the the next few weeks it particularly we are seeing this decreasing in our community but it is still here now so we need to take extra precautions making sure that we're staying away from others if we're feeling the least bit ill or if we've been in contact with somebody who's ill then they don't we need to keep our distance and keep our germs to ourselves for a while we have time for one more question this afternoon a reminder to everybody on the phone if you did not get to ask a question this afternoon there will be a statement released later today with all the information covered for recommendations on protecting families and communities from kovat 19 visit BC CDC CA for non-medical questions about the provinces Kovan 19 response visit gov dot BC CA /ko vat19 and for a full listing of the provincial health officers orders visit gov BC CA /ph oke items last question is from Dominique Levesque CBC Radio Canada hi I'd like an intern in English and in French so dr. Ann Marie casino is asking this year's not to come to the small town because of Coheed risk but in Ontario Niagara is on contrary asking Ontarians to visit to support the local economy so what do you recommend to people in the in terms of travel in the province as the summer months approached businesses reopen is it okay to travel locally or should we all stay in our own cities or the whole for me yeah no I think it's a matter of progression and timing and so I don't think we're saying things that are at odds I'm saying right now as I just said we still have you know four hundred people in our community who are recovering from this virus we know there's still some spread in our community we have 20 long-term care facility hospital outbreaks that we're managing we still are in outbreak phase with a number of community outbreaks so that tells us it's still here right now so right now this weekend stay close to home don't go traveling I absolutely think that as we continue to take the measures we're taking that we're all doing together and if we safely gradually open up our our businesses our economy as we're going into the end of May and into June then we need to look at this we need to support our businesses in smaller communities but we need to do it in a way that is protective as well so if I own a summer cottage in a small community you know yeah let's go there but let's not overwhelm that system let's bring our food with us so that we're not creating lineups and havoc at the local grocery store particularly when we know that it can be a challenge to restock sometimes over the coming weeks and months but I do think you know I've said this before we need to think about having our summer vacation in BC we have many beautiful places here in DC so let's look at BC for people in BC this summer that's a way that we can keep each other safe that we can support our local businesses but we need to do it in a measured way and be mindful of the the constraints that we have in some of our smaller communities I will also say we need to be very mindful of our indigenous communities or the indigenous communities in BC and the First Nations communities in BC many of whom are understandably wanting to protect their own communities in ways that may seem different for us but at their decisions and we need to support those decisions so don't think about going to a First Nations community unless you're invited and I think that's something we need to be very sensitive through the summer as well you can see clear knievel not publish American beaver techniques at the DIA courage to say yadi circumstance different on Ontario me II see his sons on la première period did not weapon also cubed is not a lock on say they can say house on Syria for tomorrow on a little cozy Cove it is not ample power to Donna pronounced a donkey for a pound when two men year meze away with some come Vivian dear Donna period in cinema duk-soo weekend not recommendatio say the diversity Shippuden what prop community ^ voyage imparted on our planet our voyage a dope prevents we the rested from a proper community la bien Antonio de la Paz que se Sookie fulfill upon onward me on Columbia technique me did you see key dot circumstance potato non Ontario ASAP put develop a on Columbia technique may Japan New Zealand where you see see on sweet lake on side the doctor dr.
