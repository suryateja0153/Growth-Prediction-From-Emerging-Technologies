 Hello from Ha Giang! We're Quang Vinh and Yen Trang [Vinh]: We're already at Ha Giang now. This is the second time I've been here. How do you feel now, Trang? [Trang]: I'm excited for this first time [Trang]: but extremely excited when we're standing in front of a food shop^^ [Vinh]: I know it's early, but I want to eat "rolled rice pancake" (Banh Cuon) in the cold atmosphere like this [Vinh]: They said that if you don't try the "Banh Cuon" in Ha Giang which also means you have not been to Ha Giang [Trang]: WOW! So it's really special and delicious, right? [Vinh]: Let's discover what makes it special! [Vinh]: Who is Mrs. Lan? [Woman]: She is my mother-in-law. But she's old so she cannot sell "Banh Cuon" now The address is 166A Ly Tu Trong, Ha Giang Banh Cuon Ba Lan [Vinh]: So how much for one serve? [Woman]: 24,000 for 4 pair of "Banh Cuon" (6,000/pair) and a bowl of Pork Meat Loaf soup is 7,000 [Vinh]: So 7,000 for these ones After we finish, they will calculate the price for what we've eaten [Vinh]: Yeah, it's enough [Woman]: Here you are. [Vinh]: Let's eat together [Vinh]: We'll dip the Banh Cuon in this soup [Trang]: This is the beef stock, guys. It's not the fish sauce [Vinh]: Yeah, it's made from bone marrow and pig bones Each shop will have different recipes [Trang]: But I like the Northern Banh Cuon because of the layer [Vinh]: It's very thin, right? [Trang]: Yesh, it's really thin [Vinh]: We'll not bored of eating them [Trang]: They are filled with ground pork and mushroom [Trang]: It's strange [Trang]: The taste seems like rice noodles or Pho [Vinh]: Yeah, agree [Trang]: But it's Banh Cuon [Trang]: Yeah, it taste like that [Trang]: Instead of eating rice noodle soup or Pho for breakfast [Trang]: It'll be the Banh Cuon noodle: [Vinh]: There is full of soup [Vinh]: and whenever I dip the Banh Cuon in [Vinh]: That makes me feel like I'm eating a kind of noodle soup [Trang]: Yeahhh, definitely it [Trang]: This is the first time I eat Banh Cuon but it taste like I'm eating noodle soup [Vinh]: Yesh HAHA~ [Trang]: So strange [Vinh]: I want to try the soup with fish sauce Do you want some? [Trang]: OK [Vinh]: I think the taste would be better if it's saltier  [Trang]: Yeah, bold taste will better [Trang]: Barely eat the Banh Cuon is also tasty since the filling and the outer layers make it soft and not very thick and hard [Vinh]: The weather factors is also important in enhancing the taste. It's a bit chilly when we've come here So eating this Banh Cuon in the weather like this is the besttt~ [Trang]: It's would really good if it's spicy [Vinh]: Look at this, I put a lot of chillies in [Vinh]: You can't eat spicy food? [Trang]: I can [Vinh]: I think we should try another kind [Vinh]: Can I have the Egg rolled rice pancake [Vinh]: the egg rolled rice pancake [Woman]: OK, I got it [Vinh]: The egg rice rolls are very special [Trang]: I often eat the egg rice rolls but these ones are different. They have the mugwort, don't they? [Woman]: It's bitter. Can you eat that plant? [Trang]: Oh, it's bitter? [Woman]: Yeah [Woman]: If you're not familiar with the taste, you will feel very bitter [Trang]: OH, OH [Trang]: Those who like the Vietnamese northern bare taste, you would enjoy this Banh Cuon [Trang]: For those who familiar with the food in Sai Gon and the Western Region [Trang]: you guys may feel a bit light [Vinh]: Do you guys know that Trang only drink vegetable juice in the morning to stay in shape [Trang]: Yeah, just vegetable juice and yogurt [Vinh]: So you're pretty all the time: [Vinh]: But she will eat without restraint when going on vacation, right? [Trang]: I'll eat freely when going out. Eating like a horse: [Trang]: Do you know that whenever Yen Nhi and I go on a vacation, we literally eat from day to night [Vinh]: Next, we'll try the egg rice rolls with mugwort leaves [Trang]: Yesh, that's right [Vinh]: So it's our challenge when trying this, since it seems to be very bitter [Trang]: It's hard to eat, I think so [Woman]: Mugwort leaves will relief headache [Vinh]: This can get rid of headache? [Woman]: Yesh [Vinh]: Bitter pills may have blessed effects [Vinh]: It's just a bit bitter so I can eat this, doesn't seem to be like what I thought. Try it! Acceptable bitter: I still prefer the Banh Cuon filled with ground pork I feel like when I eating this mugwort Even though it's bitter, it can relief the headache It sounds good to our health, so I'll eat that However, the pork Banh Cuon is more delicious [Trang]: Yeah, I can feel the bitter strongly [Trang]: The aroma of mugwort, too. It's hard to eat for me [Trang]: But You guys should try it to experience this taste [Trang]: Banh Cuon with pork is the besttt, right^^ [Vinh]: So what do you feel about Banh Cuon in Ha Giang? [Vinh]: I think it's an extraordinary version of Banh Cuon [Trang]: Yeah, very strange [Vinh]: Because we're familiar with the taste in Southern [Vinh]: Or in the Northern, they also use the fish sauce. It's not similar with this Banh Cuon in Ha Giang [Trang]: Yeah. Like I've said before [Trang]: It's like we're eating the noodle soup for breakfast. I don't think that we're eating the rice rolls It's a special experience. If you arrive to Ha Giang, you must try this Banh Cuon version [Trang]: It's super wonderful [Trang]: I was being mesmerized by the fascinating of the nature when we're going up here [Trang]: And the second thing is that viewing the scenery here is far different from the pictures [Vinh]: Today, we've been to Dong Van and Meo Vac in Ha Giang [Vinh]: This stop here is called Tham Ma pass You can see the famous and unique scenery of this place Those who go backpacking are all impresses by this view [Vinh]: Do you know the reason why it's called Tham Ma. [Vinh]: In the past, people want to check if it is a strong and good horse [Vinh]: They'll check by riding it up this pass. As you can see, the road is very hard to go [Trang]: I see [Vinh]: Since it's hard to go, it created a wonderful scenery [Trang]: It's not delightful but super delightful! [Trang]: What is this stop called? [Vinh]: It's just a viewpoint [Vinh]: I mean the best viewpoint to see this panorama [Vinh]: You can see there are some children wearing the back baskets of flowers It's the characteristic of Ha Giang They're colorful with the traditional dresses of minority people here [Vinh]: So you can know that visitors seize this chance to take pictures with them You guys can give them some money [Trang]: They're really cute [Trang]: I was fascinated and just want to spend all day with them The flower species on this mountain is very pretty They said that this season is the time of buckwheat flowers. So that why children bring those flowers in the baskets Its season is in the end of October and the beginning of November [Trang]: OMGGG! I love itt&lt;3 [Vinh]: I remembered that you were so scared a moment ago:  [Trang]: Yeah, I was very afraided The path to this place is quite scary because we went from the top of Mã Pí Lèng and get down to here It's the Nho Que River which is a popular destination in Ha Giang I think everyone want to check-in at this place The path from the top to the bottom of this pass was nearly 10 kilometers. So we have to travel by motorbikes [Trang]: They have a ride-hailing service here [Vinh]: Yeah 150,000 VND for a round-trip [Vinh]: And 100,000 VND per person when travel by boat like this The boat can carry 30 people But if there is just a small number of visitors, they'll go with about 5 people Like today, there are only 7 people of us on this boat But it's very worth it when we put efforts to get here Vietnam actually have numerous amazing scenery [Vinh]: Can you see the turquoise of water? [Vinh]: My yellow jacket is so fit with it~ [Trang]: We go in this season so it's a little bit sunny here.  Ah noo, I mean rainy HEHE: [Vinh]: Yeah, I wish that it's would be sunnier [Trang]: I mean rainy, a bit rainy [Vinh]: Actually, we're on the high place so the weather is inconstant It's cloudy, rainy, gloomy and then stop [Vinh]: The weather is quite good, today. It's was raining heavily on my previous trip, I can't see anything [Trang]: It must be super gorgeous if it was sunny Bonus: The "scary" of the pass road:) It's quite dangerous so be careful on your trip [Trang]: WOW! This is Mã Pì Lèng, right? [Vinh]: Yeah, it is^^ [Trang]: OMG! The scenery is amazing that makes me feel so thrilling [Trang]: To be honest, its beauty cannot be described by pictures but we have to view directly by our eyes [Trang]: I feel very high now: [Vinh]: This is my second time, but the panorama still makes me mesmerized [Vinh]: You seem like not tired! No travel sickness? How?!? [Trang]: I'm just feel a little bit [Trang]: Not clean right now HEHE~ [Vinh]: One note for you guys You should travel on a sunny day And avoid going to this place when it's rainy, especially the path to Nho Que river. It's very slippery! And the road has mud, too! So you guys must notice about this and your cloths, also You should choose a non-slip shoe that can be used for climbing mountain [Trang]: Yeah. The climbing shoes should be cleaned easily, too Don't wear like me. I chose white shoes for traveling today: [Vinh]: I'm wearing white shoes, too: Record our "white" shoes:))) [Trang]: So dirty [Vinh]: I think there are some views That don't have to be the place which we paid for visiting Like the place that near the check-in point People said that we can see the good view from that place But for me, the spot is already beautiful [Vinh]: Standing on the Mã Pì Lèng pass, we can see the overview of Nho Que river [Vinh]: Trang is lucky today since you can travel to both Nho Que River and Ma Pi Leng Pass [Trang]: Yeah. And it's not rain [Trang]: When I and Vinh arrived to some spots. It was rainy But the rain stopped very quickly [Trang]: We're so lucky when we can see these amazing views [Vinh]: Our trip today is really meaningful because we've just checked-in two famous destinations [Trang]: But there is one thing that you guys must take note You guys must be careful as much as possible Don't exchange our safety with the adventurousness Keep yourself absolutely safe at all times Hey guys It is 8:30pm now In Vietnam But we feel like on the clouds now since we have to stay in car for many hours [Vinh]: We've been on clouds all day, not only this time [Trang]: We spend more than 10 hours in the car for commuting between 2 places [Vinh]: I wake up now, Trang. It's definitely because of the food: [Trang]: But I still can't wake up when I see these bottles [Vinh]: They're just water Guys These are just "water" bottle. You guys "must'' believe Vinh: [Vinh]: On the way, I intentionally [Vinh]: went into a house of local people [Trang]: *FOODS, please be quick huhu* [Vinh]: to buy these wine bottle. It's very good! I had to ask the driver for the place that sell good wine [Vinh]: And bought them at that house [Trang]: Yeah [Vinh]: I said to the seller "I want 1 liter". Then he brought out these two bottle After that, he told me He thought I came to buy big containers like this so he prepared for me: but I only bought 2 tiny bottle:))) [Vinh]: What do you think about their price? Take a guess, Trang [Vinh]: Trang, guess their price. Just say [Trang]: 50,000 [Vinh]: 50,000 for one or both of them? [Trang]: One [Vinh]: Wrong [Trang]: Ahh, 50,000 for two [Vinh]: Wrong, too [Trang]: So what is its price? Just say the answer. [Vinh]: 10,000 for one: [Trang]: Wow, like the price for rice wine in the past [Vinh]: Yeah, with only 10,000, we can have wine to drink [Trang]: But you will have to drink alone, Vinh. I feel like I'm on clouds now [Vinh]: You eat that much spicy? [Vinh]: I'll imitate you [Vinh]: Put the wasabi in here, right [Trang]: Yeah [Trang]: It's for salmon, isn't it? [Vinh]: Yeah, very delicious! [Vinh]: What are you laughing at? [Vinh]: Try it! Don't laugh at me: [Trang]: No problem:))) [Vinh]: You see, I told you that it's enough! [Trang]: OMGG! I'm crying [Trang]: Why it's so hot?? [Trang]: I'm done [Vinh]: I'm so hungry, sis As you guys can see This dish costs 450,000 Paper rice rolls salmon [Trang]: This is stir-fried amaranth [Trang]: 40,000 [Trang]: Here's salt toasted sturgeon [Trang]: 250,000 [Trang]: It's very delicious [Trang]: They take the head and tail to make sour soup. Are you still awake, Vinh? [Vinh]: Yes, I'm [Trang]: OK [Vinh]: This is my most favorite one. It's stir fry pork belly [Vinh]: Do you remember the price?

[Trang]: But the important is that we discovered new things [Trang]: Vietnam is extremely beautiful [Trang]: Not only Ha Giang, but the other places is wonderful, too I've been to many places recently And I learned that Vietnam has many many destinations to discover We shouldn't just travel abroad to discover new things [Vinh]: Ha Giang has developed gradually. It has resorts, now. But the nature is still pristine People are not too crowded here Everything is still pristine so you can discover the amazing things here [Vinh]: The road is quite difficult to move, but it's deserved your efforts I think that traveling in Ha Giang is not suitable with families [Vinh]: Especially those who have babies [Trang]: I agree [Trang]: Since the way of moving places to places is a bite hard [Trang]: to get to the beautiful places and viewpoints [Vinh]: I think it only for young people or those who fond of adventurous trips There are several things that you guys shouldn't forget. They are about the weather choose suitable outfits, and the important is that you guys have to be safe Because the road in this place is very hard to go We're not familiar with the ways so you guys must be careful 100% Yeah, it's all about your safety [Trang]: You should put your safety first I hope that when you come to Ha Giang you'll comment below to share your story with us on Quang Vinh Youtube channel Yeah, remember to comment when you arrive to Ha Giang^^ We're actually not experts in traveling, so if we missed something.
