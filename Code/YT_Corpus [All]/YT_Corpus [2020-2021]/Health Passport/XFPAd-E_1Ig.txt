 we do have a lot to get to on the coronavirus this morning five more states will begin lifting stay-at-home restrictions this week including Colorado and Tennessee for other states started their reopening plans last week Savannah but there is a new warning from the White House's coronavirus coordinator dr. Deborah Burke she said on NBC's Meet the Press that social distancing will be with us through the summer also this morning small businesses can start applying for that anxiously awaited second round of emergency funding the program had to be temporarily shut down last week when it ran out of money meantime the u.s. is now approaching 1 million coronavirus cases the death toll now tops 54,000 we have complete coverage we're going to start with the push by some states to reopen NBC's Blaine Alexander is in Atlanta Georgia for us hey Blaine good morning well Hoda good morning to you for the first time in six weeks this restaurant is opening its doors welcoming customers into the dining room seating both inside and out here on the patio now all restaurants across Georgia have about three dozen requirements they have to satisfy before opening that includes mass servers and no more than six people per table but still some critics say that the reopening is happening too soon this morning in Georgia it's round two of the state's reopening with some salons barbershops gyms and more already up and running now movie theaters and dining restaurants will also be allowed to open their doors I mean to put it mildly we've been going through hell the White House recommends two weeks of downward trends in new kovat 19 cases before loosening restrictions a threshold Georgia currently does not meet governor Brian Kemp has said his decision is informed by data and Public Health recommendations but it's drawn intense criticism from mayor's around Georgia is absolutely premature in my mind I think that is putting all of us have risked this week is ushering in a new wave of reopening across the country in much of Tennessee restaurants and stores free to welcome customers this week at 50% capacity but the most populated areas like Nashville still shuddered in Ohio the states stay at home order is set to end on Friday it's gonna be a very slow gradual transition gradual reopening and in New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced a gradual plan to reopen some parts of the state starting with construction and manufacturing in less populated areas the region's that would be more likely able to open sooner would be the Upstate regions even the NBA allowing players to resume individual workouts at team facilities but only if their City has reopened the White House is coronavirus response coordinator dr. deborah birx braced the nation for a long battle ahead social distancing will be with us through the summer to really ensure that we protect one another but for Gary leek whose new restaurant setup includes disposable plates and menus and spaced out tables getting back to business is a matter of survival how important is it for you to reopen tomorrow more than you can imagine we're opening just for the sake of getting the wheels greased up to go forward we just can't give up now guys of course in addition to dining restaurants movie theaters also welcome to open their doors today but as for AMC the chain told The Hollywood Reporter that they don't plan to open any theaters until sometime in July when there are new movies to release Savannah all right Blaine Alexander leading us off thank you also this morning new measures are being taken to ramp up testing for the corona virus but there's also confusion this morning over whether recovered patients actually do have immunity and won't get sick again NBC's Gabe Gutierrez joins us now from a pharmacy in New York City gave good morning Savannah good morning we're here in the Bronx which has the highest infection rate per capita in New York City now the state stayed home owner home order won't expire until at least May 15th and now the governor is taking new measures to prepare for that including making thousands of pharmacies like the one behind me eligible for virus testing and some states start to reopen this morning many cities are taking new steps to ramp up testing New York's governor is now allowing all independent pharmacies in the state more than five thousand to conduct diagnostic kovat 19 tests testing is what we are compulsively obsessively focused on now but hospitalizations ICU admissions and deaths dropping at the nation's coronavirus epicenter there's also an urgent push for more antibody tests to check for possible immunity but now a new warning you may be able to get the virus more than once the World Health Organization says there is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from kovat 19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection still dr. Anthony Fauci is emphasizing the need for more testing right now you know we're doing about 1.5 two million per week we probably should get up to twice that as we get into the next several weeks California has more than 42,000 confirmed cases officials there are working to dramatically ramp up testing efforts we averaged about 2,000 tests a day through the end of March we hope to be averaging 25,000 tests a day by the end of this month in Massachusetts where cases are surging one town is testing essential workers without symptoms nearby Boston a thousand residents will be randomly picked for voluntary antibody testing all efforts to trace the spread and potentially asymptomatic carriers back in New York first responders health care workers and all essential employees are now eligible for coronavirus testing pharmacist Roger pageant le is waiting for the State Health Department to roll out the rules about getting tests and administering them we're ready when the tests are ready and we're ready when the Department of Health says go we're ready to put our gloves on get our protective equipment on and do what's best for our patients now the governor has already announced antibody tests at four New York City hospitals for now those tests will be focused on health care workers Savannah all right Gabe thank you and let's turn to NBC's medical correspondent dr. John Torres dr. John good morning I'm sure a lot of people who saw this sentence from the World Health Organization saying there's no evidence yet that people who have these antibodies are in fact immune from getting sick again sure a lot of people were disturbed by that what does that mean is the whu-oh just being really careful in its language in Savannah I think you're right I think a lot of people waking up getting very concerned thinking they might get coronavirus the second time that is not what the World Health Organization said what the World Health Organization said is we don't know what happens if you have antibodies we don't know how long those antibodies will protect you if at all because we simply don't have enough information about this virus but their main emphasis was about the antibody tests themselves saying number one we're not sure their reliability because they have been pushed out so fast and so quickly and number two that passport people are talking about the certificate of immunity they're very concerned about that because they think people might be using those erroneously and that could give people a false sense of security that they don't want people to have they still want them to do all the social distancing and everything else to make sure they stay protected not going out thinking I have immunity I can do whatever I want back to the primary point there we don't have the studies yet to show that there's some immunity after somebody has had this virus but there is there any reason to think that this wouldn't track with other viruses so that there's some level of immunity yeah at this point there's no reason to think it won't be like other corona viruses where you do get a level of immunity but what they don't know is what level of antibodies do you actually need to get some of that immunity and how long will that immediately last what they have found out is that some people have high levels of antibodies other people who had infections verified infections aren't showing much levels of antibodies at all they're not exactly sure what that means at this point this can take years to figure that out and so again they're trying to make sure that people don't have that false sense of security having a positive test saying I have antibodies therefore I can do whatever I want and I don't have to necessarily take the precautions there saying number one again the tests aren't that accurate number two they want to make sure that people aren't getting each other infected by doing that just real quickly what happened antibody tests been such a problem they seem to be inaccurate leading to some false positives there's a bunch of different types there seems to be a little of black market out there I mean why why is this such a confusing area and it's not just a confusing area here in the US it's around the world if you remember the UK they ordered antibody tests from China and now they're asking for refunds because those tests weren't that good so it's one of those things that this virus has come on so fast and so quickly it's hard to get a test that quick and that accurate at the same time and plus there have been some stumbles along the way from different authorities trying to look at validating these tests and whether they can validate them as quickly as they liked you so they're pushing them out faster then probably a lot of scientists are saying they should so that combination I think is giving us these tests out there that aren't necessarily the tests we want or need but that's going to take years to get so in the meantime these tests can help a little bit but they're not as accurate and as reliable as we'd like them to be all right makes sense dr. Torres thanks for your time appreciate it h-how'd over to you all right now to a troubling new warning about the nation's food supply which was already a major concern on many minds of consumers it's coming from one of the country's top meat companies NBC's Kerry Sanders has been covering that story for us he's in Fort Lauderdale this morning hey Kerry good morning well good morning this morning there is a warning that our nation's meat supply is about to be tested ranchers report in the last seven days they've sent 30% fewer cattle to market because the meat processors can't handle it and it's not just beef same thing with pork and also chicken what that means to us is that we may see less meat at the grocery store the food supply chain is breaking that's the warning in a full-page ad from Tyson Foods released in The New York Times on Sunday it comes after one of the country's largest meat processors closed a massive pork processing plant in Iowa because of a corona virus outbreak the letter from Tyson's president going on to say there will be limited supply of our products available in grocery stores until we're able to reopen facilities that are currently closed and modes that start coming to our plant people start being carried out of there and so we were always asking our supervisors basically what is it that's going on here NBC News talked to one tyson worker at that iowa plant who concealed their identity didn't have enough material or masks and things like that to provide to us so they would start giving us different types of rags and stuff that they had that they have wash to clean tyson responding telling NBC news we've been working diligently to protect our team members early on we allowed workers to bring their own masks and we even supplied some until we could secure surgical style coverings which we now require all team members to wear adding we aren't aware of any ambulance visits to the plant for covert 19 related reasons NBC News has not been able to independently confirm ambulances at the Tyson plant Tyson's Waterloo plant one of several closed across the country shut down by beef pork and poultry companies trying to contain virus outbreaks the CEO of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association says he fears things are only going to get worse if we start to see panic buying much like we did the first two weeks of this pandemic yes we are going to have an issue our meat suppliers the processors say in their freezers they do have a supply of beef pork and chicken but the longer that the processing plants are closed the faster the nation's meat supply will dwindle Savannah it's gonna get a lot of people's attention this morning Carrie thank you and now to another story we are following closely the mystery and growing speculation surrounding the health and whereabouts of North Korea's leader Kim jong-un today senior international correspondent kare Simmons has the latest for this on a scare good morning hey Savannah good morning the rumors are really swirling now including one suggesting that Kim jong-un's surgeons hands was shaking in fear now US officials have told NBC news of indications that Kim jong-un has had cardiovascular sir but as ever with North Korea it's really hard to get to the truth kim jonghwan has not been seen in public for more than two weeks these images are thought to show the Supreme Leader's train near the North Korean coast at a luxury compound but on Saturday Kim skipped his second major events army day it's a deepening mystery with rumors about his poor health and possible demise making headlines around the globe Reuters reporting a team including medics flew into North Korea from China one well-connected Chinese commentator posting two millions of followers some wait for the official announcement suit yourself her posts later deleted but not by her she claimed their army shark net US Senator Lindsey Graham saying over the weekend I'd be shocked if he's not there distr admitting he does not have any direct knowledge South Korea still insisting its intelligence shows nothing unusual a North Korean newspaper claiming Kim even sent a letter how closely guarded is Kindra and how many people around him would know that something is wrong that would be a very small circle of people the rumors on the ground are probably people on the outside when today made a rare trip to the world's most isolated dictatorship we found Kim jong-un's image everywhere so you thank Kim Jong moon for this whatever the truth this woman may be central behind the scenes Kim jong-un's sister represented him at the Winter Olympics and accompanied him during his two summits with President Trump now it's possible of course that Kim jong-un is in lockdown over the corona virus but savanna it's so important because remember North Korea is a nuclear armed nation if it lost its leader a weakened world would face another crisis savanna all right Kerry Simmons thank you
