 CANADIANS WITH THEIR LATEST BRIEFING TODAY. LET'S LISTEN IN.  I WILL NOW GIVE THEM THE FLOOR FOR TODAY'S UPDATE REGARD ING COVID-19. DR. TAM?  THANK YOU. AS USUAL I WILL BEGIN WITH AN UP DATE ON COVID-19 IN CANADA. NOW 101,337 CASES INCLUDING 8430 DEATHS AND 63,886 PEOPLE OR 63% NOW RECOVERED. LABS ACROSS CANADA HAVE TESTED OVER 2,415,000 PEOPLE FOR COVID-19 TO DATE. OVER THE PAST WEEK AN AVERAGE OF 38,000 TESTED DAILY WITH 1% OF TESTS POSITIVE. THESE NUMBERS CHANGE QUICKLY AND ARE UPDATED DAILY. IN THE EVENING, CANADA.CA/ CORONAVIRUS. DURING THESE MONTHS OF LIVING WITH COVID-19 WE'VE ALL MADE SACRIFICES IN THE COLLECTIVE OF THE OF CONTROLLING THE SPREAD OF A COVID-19. THESE DISRUPTIONS HAVE IMPACTED THE MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF MANY CANADIANS WITH SOME TURN ING TO SUBSTANCES LIKE ALCOHOL TO COPE. A RECENT SURVEY CONDUCTED BY THE CANADIAN CENTRE ON SUBSTANCE USE AND ADDICTION FOUND THAT ONE IN FOUR RESPONDENTS AGE 35 TO 5 AND ONE IN FAVE 18-34 YEARS INCREASED THEIR ALCOHOL USE DURING THE PANDEMIC. THE LACK OF A REGULAR SCHEDULE, STRESS AND BOREDOM WERE THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR INCREASED DRINKING. EVEN MORE CONCERNING ARE THE RESULTS PUBLISHED LAST WEEK BY THE CENTRE FOR ADDICTION AND MENTAL HEALTH WHERE ONE IN FOUR RESPONDENTS AGE 15-59 INDICATE THEY ENGAGED IN BINGE DRINKING. THESE ARE TRYING TIMES AND NORMAL TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO COPE WITH STRESS AND UNCERTAINTY, CONCERN ABOUT POTENTIAL RISKS OF POTENTIAL USE AMONG CANADIANS DURING COVID-19. DRINKING TOO MUCH ALCOHOL CAN LEAD TO NEGATIVE OUTCOMES FOR CANADIANS AND FAMILIES INCLUDING INJURIES, MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENT S AND CANCER AND LIVER DISEASE. I ENCOURAGE CANADIANS CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO COPE SUCH AS REGULAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF ALCOHOL ON THE HEALTH. WHILE THE BEST WAY TO AVOID SHORT AND LONG-TERM RISK FROM ALCOHOL IS NOT TO DRINK. CANADIANS CAN CONSULT CANADA'S LOW RISK ALCOHOL DRINKING GUIDE LINES OR STRATEGIES TO HELP LOWER THE RISK. THIS OFFERS INFORMATION ON STANDARD DRINK SIZES, RECOMMEND ED DAILY AND WEEKLY LIMITS AND INFORMATION AND RE MINDERS TO REDUCE HIGH RISK AND EXPOSURES. IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT DRINKING OR WOULD LIKE INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE YOU CAN GET SUPPORT I ENCOURAGE YOU TO SPEAK WITH YOUR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER AND FIND TIPS FOR TAKING CARE OF YOUR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH ON THE CANADA .CA/CORONAVIRUS WEBSITE OR VISIT WELLNESS TOGETHER CANADA ONLINE FOR A RANGE OF MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE SUPPORT AT NO COST. FEAR, STRESS AND WORRY ARE NORMAL DURING A CRISIS. NO ONE HAS TO GO THROUGH THIS ALONE. THERE ARE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO HELP US GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER. THANK YOU. MERCI.  THANK YOU SO MUCH, DR. TAM. DR. NOOJ?  MERCI.  (Voice of Interpreter): THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON. I WILL BEGIN WITH AN UPDATE ON THE LATEST NUMBERS OF COVID-19 IN CANADA. THERE ARE NOW 101,337 CASES INCLUDING 8340 DEATHS AND 63,686 PEOPLE OR 62% WHO HAVE NOW RECOVERED. LABS ACROSS CANADA HAVE TESTED 2 ,415,000 PEOPLE FOR COVID-19 TO DATE. OVER THE PAST WEEK AN AVERAGE OF 38,000 PEOPLE WERE TESTED DAILY WITH JUST OVER 1% TESTING POSITIVE. THESE NUMBERS CHANGE QUICKLY AND ARE UPDATED DAILY IN THE EVENING ON CANADA.CA/CORONAVIRUS. DURING THESE MONTHS OF LIVING WITH COVID-19, WE'VE ALL MADE SACRIFICES IN THE COLLECTIVE EFFORT TO CONTROL THE SPREAD OF COVID-19. WHILE NECESSARY, THESE MEASURES AND OTHER DISRUPTIONS TO OUR DAILY LIVES HAVE IMPACTED THE MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF MANY CANADIANS WITH SOME TURNING TO SUBSTANCES LIKE ALCOHOL TO COPE. A RECENT SURVEY CONDUCTED BY THE CANADIAN CENTRE ON SUBSTANCE USE AND ADDICTION FOUND THAT ONE IN FOUR RESPONDENTS AGE 35 TO 53 YEARS HAD INCREASED THEIR USE DURING THE PANDEMIC. FOR THOSE AGED BETWEEN 18-34 YEARS OLD IT'S ONE IN FIVE. THE LACK OF A REGULAR SCHEDULE, STRESS AND BOREDOM WERE THE MOST COMMON REASONS CITED AMONG RESPONDENTS FOR INCREASED DRINKING. EVEN MORE CONCERNING ARE THE RESULTS PUBLISHED LAST WEEK BY THE CENTRE FOR ADDICTION AND MENTAL HEALTH. MORE THAN ONE IN FOUR RESPONDENT S 18 TO 59 YEARS INDICATED THEY HAD ENGAGED IN BINGE DRINKING DURING THE PAST SEVEN DAYS. THE TIMES ARE DIFFICULT AND NORMAL TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO COPE WITH STRESS AND UNCERTAINTY. HOWEVER, RISKS OF INCREASED ALCOHOL USE AMONG CANADIANS DURING COVID-19. DRINKING TOO MUCH ALCOHOL CAN LEAD TO NEGATIVE OUTCOMES FOR CANADIANS AND THEIR FAMILIES. FOR EXAMPLE INJURY, MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENTS, VIOLENT CRIME , FETAL ALCOHOL SPECTRUM DISORDER AND NUMEROUS CHRONIC DISEASES LIKE SKERS AND -- CANCERS AND LIVER DISEASE. DURING THIS DITCH TIME WE ENCOURAGE CANADIANS TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO COPE WITH THEIR STRESS. FOR EXAMPLE REGULAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND ENCOURAGE THEM TO CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF ALCOHOL ON THEIR HEALTH. THE BEST WAY TO VOID SHORT AND LONG-TERM RISKS FROM ALCOHOL IS TO NOT DRINK. HOWEVER, IF THEY CHOOSE TO DO SO THEY CAN ACCESS DRINKING LINES FOR STRATEGY STRATEGIES HOW TO LOWER THE RISK. THIS RESOURCE OFFERS INFORMATION ON STANDARD DRINK STANDARDS AND THE WEBSITE OFFERS INFORMATION AND REMINDERS TO REDUCE HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES AND EXPOSURES. IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR DRINKING OR IF YOU WOULD LIKE INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE YOU CAN GET SUPPORT, I ENCOURAGE YOU TO OR WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO SPEAK WITH YOUR HEALTHCARE PROVIDER. YOU CAN ALSO FIND TIPS FOR TAKING CARE OF YOUR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH ON THE CANADA .CA/CORONAVIRUS WEBSITE. YOU CAN VISIT WELLNESS TOGETHER CANADA ONLINE FOR A RANGE OF MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE SUPPORTS AT NO COST. IT IS NORMAL TO FEEL FEAR, STRESS AND WORRY IN A CRISIS. NO ONE HAS TO GO THROUGH THIS ALONE. THERE ARE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO HELP US ALL GET THROUGH THIS TOGETHER. THANK YOU.  FOR DR. NJOO. I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY ON GUIDELINES FOR EASING RESTRICTIONS FOR PUBLIC SERVANTS. EVERY ASPECT OF OUR ECONOMY HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY COVID-19 HAS HAD INTERACTIONS WITH OTHERS IN THE WAY WE WORK. LIKE MANY CANADIANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN MID MARCH LARGE NUMBER OF PUBLIC SERVANTS HAD TO TRADE THEIR TRADITIONAL WORKSITE S FOR DINING ROOM, KITCHENS AND BEDROOM OFFICES. SINCE THEN MANY OF THEM HAVE WORKED LONG HOURS IN NEW WAYS AND OFTEN IN DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES OR TAKEN ON NEW RESPONSIBILITIES. NEW SERVICES THAT WOULD NORMALLY HAVE TAKEN MANY MONTHS TO PLAN AND EXECUTE WERE RULED OUT IN A MATTER OF DAYS OR WEEKS. EXAMPLES INCLUDE THE CANADA EMERGENCY RESPONSE BENEFIT ALSO KNOWN AS CERB. THE CANADA EMERGENCY RELIEF BENEFIT. AND COORDINATING THE LARGEST REPATRIATION EFFORT IN CANADIAN HISTORY. MILLIONS OF CANADIANS WERE IN NEED AND THE SPEED AT WHICH CRITICAL SERVICES WERE ROLLED OUT IN UNPRECEDENTED WAYS. WE HAVE NOW BY AND LARGE, HOWEVER, ENTERED A NEW PHASE. THE GROWTH CURVE IS TRENDING DOWNWARDS. PROVINCES ARE AT VARYING PACES REOPENING THEIR ECONOMIES AND RESTRICTIONS ARE GRADUALLY EASED WITH THAT IN MIND RECEIVED GUIDANCE ON HOW TO RESPOND TO THIS EASING OF RESTRICTIONS TO SUPPORT PLANS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO FEDERAL WORKPLACES. THIS GUIDANCE WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE WILL BEGIN AS A RESULT OF CONSULTATIONS WITH BARGAINING AGENTS AND CONTRIBUTION FROM INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL EXPERTS NOTING THAT HEALTH AUTHORITIES HAVE STATED THAT PHYSICAL DISTANCING MEASURE S SHOULD REMAIN, THESE WILL MAKE PROVISIONS FOR THE FACT MANY PUBLIC SERVANTS WILL WORK REMOTELY FOR SOME TIME TO COME. INDEED, AS PLANS UNFOLD, THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF EMPLOYS WILL BE AN ABSOLUTE PRIORITY FOR OUR GOVERNMENT. INCREASING ACCESS TO FEDERAL WORKSITES FOR EMPLOYEES AND THE PUBLIC WILL BE GRADUAL AND TIME WILLING VARY FROM ORGANIZATION TO ORGANIZATION AND FROM ONE LOCATION IN CANADA TO ANOTHER BASED ON THEIR UNIQUE SITUATIONS I WANT TO STRESS THAT EMPLOYEES OF EVERY ORGANIZATION WILL BE BEGIN REASONABLE NOTICE AND ASSURANCES ABOUT THE SAFETY MEASURES THAT WILL APPLY BEFORE BEING ASKED TO RETURN TO THEIR WORKSITE. IN THE MEANTIME THE INNOVATION SCENE IN THE LAST MONTHS WE WILL CONTINUE TO LEVERAGE TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGY TO SERVE CANADAS IN MORE MODERN AND EFFICIENT WAYS. THE PANDEMIC HAS SHOWN HOW FAST AND NIMBLE PUBLIC SERVICE CAN BE AND HOW IMPORTANT THE PUBLIC SERVICE IS TO CANADIANS. AMID A PUBLIC PANDEMIC THEY'VE WORKED TIRELESSLY. ON BEHALF OF ALL CANADIANS I THANK ALL PUBLIC SERVANTS FOR SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY. I KNOW THEY WILL CONTINUE TO SERVE OUR COUNTRY WITH UN WAVERING COMMITMENT AND DEDICATION. [ Speaking French ]  (Voice of Interpreter): I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON THE EASING OF RESTRICTIONS FOR PUBLIC SERVANTS. ALL SECTORS AND ALL DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF OUR ECONOMY WERE AFFECTED BY COVID-19. THIS AFFECTED THE WAY THAT WE WORKED AND THE PLACES IN WHICH WE WORKED. IN MID MARCH A LOT OF PUBLIC SERVANTS HAD TO CHANGE THEIR USUAL WORKPLACES BY THEIR KITCHEN, THEIR DINING ROOM TABLE S OR THEIR BEDROOM. AND SINCE THEN PUBLIC SERVANTS HAVE WORKED LONG HOURS IN INNOVATIVE WAYS AND TAKEN ON MORE RESPONSIBILITIES IN ENVIRONMENTS THAT WERE SOMETIMES DIFFICULT. NEW SERVICES WHICH USUALLY WOULD HAVE TAKEN MANY MONTHS TO PUT INTO PLACE WERE PUT IN PLACE IN A COUPLE OF DAYS OR A COUPLE WEEKS. FOR EXAMPLE CANADA EMERGENCY RESPONSE BENEFITS, THE CERB, THE CANADIAN EMERGENCY WAGE SUBSIDY. COORDINATING THE LARGEST REPATRIATION EFFORT OF CANADIANS IN THE COUNTRY'S HISTORY. MILLION OFFICE CANADIANS WERE IN NEED SOMETIMES THEY WERE IN DANGER AND SPEED AT WHICH SERVICES WERE OFFERED BY THE PUBLIC SERVICE WAS UNPRECEDENTED NOW WE ARE IN A NEW PHASE OF THINGS. THE GROWTH CURVE OF COVID-19 IS TRENDING DOWNWARD. PROVINCES AND TERRITORIES ARE RE OPENING THEIR ECONOMIES AT THEIR OWN PACE AND THEIR RESTRICTIONS ARE GRADUALLY BEING LIFTED. DEPUTY HEADS OF THE GOVERNMENT AND AGENCIES RECEIVED ADVICE ON HOW TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE EASING OF RESTRICTIONS SO THAT THEY COULD INCREASE ACCESS TO FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WORKPLACES. THIS ADVICE WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AND CREATED AFTER NEGOTIATIONS WITH DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND UNIONS INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY. HEALTH AUTHORITIES HAVE STATED THAT SOCIAL DISTANCING MEASURES NEED TO BE MAINTAINED AND SO NEW PLAN WILL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT A LOT OF PUBLIC SERVANTS WILL NEED TO CONTINUE WORKING REMOTELY FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME. AS THINGS EVOLVE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY WILL STILL BE THE PRIORITY FOR OUR GOVERNMENT. INCREASING ACCESS TO FEDERAL WORKSITES FOR EMPLOYS AND THE PUBLIC WILL BE PROGRESSIVE AND THE TIMELINES WILL CHANGE FROM ONE ORGANIZATION TO ANOTHER AND ONE WORKSITE TO ANOTHER. IT WILL DEPEND ON EACH ORGANIZATION'S INDIVIDUAL SITUATION. I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THE EMPLOYEES OF ALL OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS WILL RECEIVE REASONABLE NOTICE AND ASSURANCES REGARDING HEALTH MEASURES IN PLACE BEFORE THEY ARE INVITED TO COME BACK TO WORK. THE PANDEMIC HAS SHOWN JUST HOW THE PUBLIC SERVICE OF CANADA CAN BE QUICK AND FLEXIBLE AND HOW IMPORTANT THE ROLE IS. IN THIS CONTEXT OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC CANADA'S PUBLIC SERVANT S WORKED TIRELESSLY FOR CANADIANS AND ON BEHALF OF EVERYONE I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ALL THE PUBLIC SERVANTS FOR THEIR GREAT WORK FOR OUR COUNTRY I KNOW THEY WILL CONTINUE TO SERVE AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE AN UNWAVERING COMMITMENT AND DEVOTION TO ALL CANADIANS. THANK YOU AND WE WILL NOW ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. [ End of Interpretation ]  THANK YOU, WE START WITH QUESTIONS FROM THE PHONE.  ONE QUESTION, ONE FOLLOW-UP. OPERATOR?  THANK YOU. OUR FIRST QUESTION FROM MIA ROBSON WITH THE CANADIAN PRESS. PLEASE GO AHEAD.  GOOD MORNING. I'M HEARING IF YOU COULD TELL US TO WHAT-DEGREE YOU'VE BEEN EXPLORING OR CONTEMPLATING PUBLIC SERVANTS WORKING PERMANENTLY.  THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO READ A MOST IMPORTANT MESSAGE THIS MORNING WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL TO PUBLIC SERVANTS FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS OF THEIR IMPORTANT WORK. WE KNOW THAT IMPORTANT WORK WAS ONLY ESSENTIAL FOR CANADIANS. NOT ONLY ESSENTIAL FOR CANADIANS BUT OFTEN DELIVERED IN A MANNER WHICH WAS DIFFICULT BOTH FOR PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL REASON S. THIS BEING SAID WE HAVE SEEN THE PUBLIC SERVICE CAN BE NIMBLE, CAN BE QUITE QUICK AND EFFICIENT IN THE ABILITY TO REACT TO EMERGENCIES IN CRISIS AND WE HAVE LEARNED LESSONS IN THAT PROCESS AND ONE OF THE LESSON IS THAT WE CAN BE MORE FLEXIBLE OVER TIME. WE HAVE SEEN THAT EFFICIENCY AND AGILITY DON'T CONTRADICT EACH OTHER. WE CAN HAVE A PUBLIC SERVICE WHICH AS YOU SAID CAN BE WORKING REMOTELY WHILE SERVING CANADIANS VERY EFFICIENTLY SO WE EXPECT THAT THESE WILL BE, WILL HAVE BEEN LEARNED AND APPLIED OVER THE NEXT WEEKS AND MONTHS AND YEARS DUE TO THE -- YES, I EXPECT THAT BECAUSE OF THE IMPORTANT LEARNING EXPERIENCES THAT WE HAVE MADE THEY WILL BE MORE AGILITY AND MORE FLEXIBILITY WHEN IT COMES TO TELEWORKING.  FOLLOW-UP?  YES, THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER ON FRIDAY SAID THE GOVERNMENT HASN'T PROVIDED SUFFICIENT RESOURCES FOR THE INCREASE IN ACCESS TO INFORMATION REQUEST. ARE YOU INTENDING TO INCREASE THIS FUNDING AND IF NOT WHY NOT?  WELL, FIRST ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL QUESTION AND SECOND, ACCESS TO INFORMATION IS KEY REGARDLESS OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND, IN FACT IT'S EVEN MORE IMPORTANT IN SITUATIONS OF CRISIS BECAUSE AS WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS THE CANADIANS HAVE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES AND LOOK FOR INFORMATION FROM THE GOVERNMENT. BOTH IN PROTECTING THEIR HEALTH AND PROTECTING THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE ENDS MEET. SO WE ARE, OF COURSE, UNDERSTAND ING OF THE DIFFICULTY THAT PUBLIC SERVANTS HAVE HAD OVER THE PAST WEEKS IN PART BECAUSE OF TELEWORKING AND PROVIDING A LEVEL OF INFORMATION THAT JOURNALISTS LIKE YOU REQUIRE IN YOUR DAILY WORK. BUT WE DO FEEL THAT WE NEED TO DO BETTER OVER THE LONGER TERM AND THAT WILL INVOLVE THE WORK ING CLOSELY WITH WITH THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER. I'VE TALKED WITH HER A COUPLE OF TIMES IN THE LAST WEEKS WE HAVE BOTH AGREED ON IMPORTANT PRIORITIES SUCH AS MORE PRO ACTIVITY DISCLOSURE INFORMATION TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR MEDIA AGAIN TO HAVE ACCESS MORE QUICKLY WITHOUT HAVING TO ASK FOR MORE QUICKLY FOR INFORMATION AS WELL AS WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST WEEKS MAKE TECHNOLOGY MORE CENTRAL IN THE WAY IN WHICH THE GOVERNMENT OPERATES. THELOGICAL WEAKNESSES ACROSS TO SEE THEY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR PUBLIC SERVANTS TO DELIVER INFORMATION TO THE MEDIA. WE CAN DO A LOT BETTER AND WE KNOW HOW IN MANY CASES BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES THAT ARE DOING MUCH BETTER THAN OTHERS AND AGAIN THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER AND I HAVE HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT.  THANK YOU, NEXT QUESTION, PLEASE.  THANK YOU, MERCI. OUR NEXT QUESTION. PLEASE GO AHEAD.  (Voice of Interpreter): GOOD AFTERNOON. I WOULD LIKE DATA REGARDING THE CERB. WE HAVEN'T HAD AN UPDATE SINCE JUNE 4 ONLINE. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE USING THE CERB. THEY DON'T KNOW THE COST OF THE EXTENSION THAT WAS ANNOUNCED: CAN YOU TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT THAT TODAY? ANSWER. WE'RE AROUND 8 MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE USING THE CERB FOR 8 MILLION PEOPLE AT SOME POINT RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE CERB PAYMENT. THAT'S ABOUT A TOTAL OF 18 MILLION APPLICATIONS AND THE BUDGET FOR NOW IS ABOUT $53 BILLION. SECONDLY THE SHORTLY AN UPDATE BY MINISTER QUATTRO ON THE IMPORTANT STATISTICS AND THAT INCLUDES MORE UPDATED NUMBERS THAN THOSE I'VE JUST GIVEN YOU AND THE THIRD THING IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO ANNOUNCE THIS SHORTLY. MR. MORENO IS WORKING ON THIS, AN UPDATE ON FORECASTS FOR THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS. WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT ACCORDING TO THE STATISTICS AVAILABLE THERE IS A TREND AND THERE'S THERE'S A DECREASE OF APPLICATIONS FOR THE CERB AND THAT SHOWS OVER THE PAST WEEKS THAT THE PROVINCES AND TERRITOR IES RESTARTING THEIR ECONOMIES AND MORE JOBS EMPTY. WAGE SUBSIDY SO HELY REPLACING THE CERB. FOLLOW-UP QUESTION? LAST WEEK WE ASKED YOU AND A QUESTION REGARDING THE COST HE SAID IT'S DIFFICULT TO ASSESS LAST WEEK YOU TALKED ABOUT $1.2 MILLION IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY. WE DON'T KNOW HOW THINGS WILL EVOLVE. WE UNDERSTAND THAT. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM LAST WEEK. LAST WEEK YOU SAID $17 BILLION A MONTH MAYBE TODAY WHAT CAN YOU TELL US? ANSWER. THIS IS A LEGITIMATE QUESTION. WORKING HARD IN ORDER TO CREATE FORECASTS. $17 BILLION AS AN ESTIMATE PER MONTH AND THIS DATA, THIS NUMBER WAS BASED ON THE FIRST MONTH AND AFTER THE FIRST MONTH THERE WAS A DECREASE IN APPLICATIONS BETWEEN MARCH AND MAY, A CONGRESS OF ABOUT 20%. AND SINCE MAY, WITH GAMES REOPEN ING WE'RE EXPECTING THIS DECREASE TO BE MORE SIGNIFICANT. I THINK THAT FOR A GOOD JOURNAL IST SUCH AS YOURSELF, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET AN IDEA OF THE FUTURE BY LOOKING AT THE DATA FROM MARCH TO MAY AND MORE SPECIFIC DATA AND THAT'S WHY THOSE THREE MINISTERS WILL HAVE BETTER ESTIMATES SHORTLY. QUESTION. WHEN WILL THIS BE AVAILABLE? ANSWER AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BUT WE WANT TO BE PRECISE MORE THAN WE WANT TO BE QUICK. ON JUNE 5 WE GOT DATA ON EMPLOY MENT. WE CAN FORECAST APPLICATIONS FROM JULY TO AUGUST. WE WERE WAITING ON THIS EMPLOY MENT DATA THAT WE RECEIVED ON JUNE 5 SO THAT WE CAN USE ECONOMIC AND STATIC METHODS TO GIVE A MORE ACCURATE GIVE US A MORE ACCURATE IDEA OF THE FUTURE NEXT QUESTION, PLEASE.  OUR NEXT QUESTION. PLEASE GO AHEAD.  (Voice of Interpreter): HELLO , MR. DUCLOS. STUDENTS GOING BACK TO WORK, 150,000 OF THEM. YOU SHOULD HAVE AN IDEA HOW PUBLIC SERVANTS ARE WORKING. DO YOU HAVE A NUMBER ON HOW MANY OF THEM COULD GO BACK TO WORK AND WORK IN THOSE OFFICES AND MAINTAIN PHYSICAL DISTANCING WITHOUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT LOCAL SITUATIONS. HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD BE ABLE TO GO BACK TO THEIR OFFICE? ANSWER. I'LL ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IN A MOMENT BUT I WANT TO COME BACK TO DATA I FORGOT TO MENTION REGARDING TELEWORK. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CRISIS WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA TO OFFER TELEWORK TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSAND S OF PUBLIC SERVANTS. OVER THE PAST WEEKS I WAS ABLE TO NOTE THAT DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF PUBLIC SERVANTS WERE ABLE TO HAVE SECURE ACCESS TO THE NETWORK. 140 CONNECTIONS BEFORE THE CRISIS AND NOW AT 280 SECURE CONNECTIONS. THIS IS A LOT OF CONNECTIONS THAT THE EMPLOYEES CAN USE AND AT 1 HUB THOUSAND EMPLOYEES OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE WHO CAN THAT CAN IN DIFFERENT GROUPS, OF COURSE, BE PARTICIPATING IN VIRTUAL MEETINGS AS WELL OUR TELECONFERENCE CAPACITY WHICH IS QUITE IMPORTANT REGARDING TELE WORK OUR CAPACITY WENT FROM 1.6 MILLION PER DAY SO WE TRIPL ED OUR ABILITY TO WORK IN TELECONFERENCE MODE. A LOT HAS CHANGED AT THE PUBLIC SERVICE SO TELEWORK IS MORE POSSIBLE NOW BUT ALSO A LOT MORE EFFICIENT THAN IT WAS BEFORE THE CRISIS. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE RETURN OF PUBLIC SERVANTS TO WORK, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THEIR RETURN TO THEIR OFFICES BECAUSE PUBLIC SERVANTS HAVE BEEN WORK ING OVER THE PAST WEEKS AND SOME OF THEM WERE WORKING EVEN HARDER THAN BEFORE THE CRISIS BECAUSE THEY WERE IN CRISIS MANAGEMENT MODE. I WANT TO BE SPECIFIC HERE. TALKING ABOUT A RETURN TO THEIR PHYSICAL OFFICE AND NOT THE RETURN TO WORK. NOW COMING BACK TO YOUR QUESTION , MINISTER ANNAN WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PSPC PROCUREMENT HAS BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN THERE WILL BE A PROGRESSIVE RETURN TO FEDERAL OFFICES, WELL GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT PHYSICAL DISTANC ING IS MAINTAINED THAT EQUIPMENT GIVEN ALL THE RULES NEED TO BE APPLIED. MINISTER ANNAN MIGHT REMEMBER THE NUMBERS MORE THAN I DO BUT I CAN SAY THAT THINGS ARE GOING WELL. TELEWORK IS A LOT MORE SOLID NOW THAN BEFORE THE CRISIS. BEFORE WE MOVE TO A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION ARE YOU ABLE TO REPEAT THE STATISTICS IN ENGLISH, PLEASE.  GONE TOO QUICKLY ON THE VERY STRONG SET OF STATICS SAYING THAT IN A MATTER OF A FEW WEEKS WE HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVE MENTS IN THE ABILITY FOR PUBLIC SERVANTS TO WORK, TO DO TELEWORKING AND THREE KEY STATIC S THEY WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT. THE FIRST IS THAT THE NUMBER OF SECURE CONNECTIONS THAT PUBLIC SERVANTS CAN MAKE IS INCREASED FROM 140,000 TO 280,000 IN THE DURATION OF THE CRISIS. DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF SECURE CONNECTIONS THAT PUBLIC SERVANTS CAN MAKE IN EXCHANGING INFORMATION FOR THEIR WORK. ANOTHER IMPORTANT STATIC IS THAT 100,000 PUBLIC SERVANTS CAN HAVE A VIRTUAL MEETING SIMULTANEOUSLY AT THE SAME TIME. IN DIFFERENT GROUPS. A VERY SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PUBLIC SERVANTS WHO CAN SEE EACH OTHER AND TALK TO EACH OTHER AND FINALLY A NUMBER OF TELE CONFERENCE MINUTES THAT WE CAN USE FOR THE BENEFIT OF PUBLIC SERVANTS HAS TRIPLED FROM 1.6 MILLION TO 5 MILLION MINUTES PER DAY SO THOSE ARE MANY MINUTE S OF TELECONFERENCE WORK THAT PUBLIC SERVANTS CAN DO EVERY DAY SO WE HAVE THAT CAPACITY OVER THE LAST WEEKS. AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CRISIS WILL NEVER BE EASY OR NEVER WELCOME. THEY DO IN SOME CASES BRING ABOUT IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENTS AND I THINK THAT THESE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE AGILITY AND ABILITY OF PUBLIC SERVANTS TO MAKE MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF CANADIAN IS GOOD USE. THANK YOU. FOLLOW-UP QUESTION.  SO YOU DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC NUMBER ON THE NUMBER OF PUBLIC SERVANTS IN THEIR OFFICES. YOU SAID YOU'VE BEEN NEGOTIATING WITH UNIONS REGARDING WORKERS. WE KNOW THAT TELEWORK IS COSTLY FOR WORKERS AT HOME. ARE YOU CONSIDERING COMPENSATING PUBLIC SERVANTS FOR THIS? ARE YOU OPEN TO THIS? DO YOU HAVE THE BUDGET FOR IT? ANSWER. THE ANSWER IS YES. OVER THE PAST FEW WEEKS THERE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE CAPACITY OF PUBLIC SERVANTS TO BE CONNECTED BUT THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DEVICES THAT WERE PURCHASED BY PROCUREMENT CANADA AND GIVEN TO PUBLIC SERVANTS FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT THEIR WORK SAFELY AT HOME. WE ALSO KNOW THAT SOME PUBLIC SERVANTS WERE MORE EFFECTIVE, MORE EFFICIENT THAN OTHERS WORK ING AT HOME BUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT IN CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTS, IT IS MORE BENEFICIAL FOR PEOPLE TO WORK IN AN OFFICE SO IN SOME CASES THERE ARE MORE EFFICIENCY WITH WORKING FROM HOME AND PUBLIC SERVANTS PREFER THAT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO COMMUTE, FEWER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH COMMUTING BUT ALSO CERTAIN ADVANTAGES WITH GOING TO THE OFFICE TO WORK. WE'LL CONTINUE TO WORK HARD TO CONTINUE THAT PUBLIC SERVANTS HAVE ALL THEY NEED TO DO THEIR WORK. TO RESPOND TO YOUR QUESTION REGARDING SUPPORTING THESE PUBLIC SERVANTS IT DEPENDS ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES, THEIR PERSONAL AND FAMILY LIFE, THE NATURE OF THEIR WORK, OF COURSE, WHAT THEIR JOB ENTAILS BUT ALSO LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH CONSIDERATIONS TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. THE RETURN TO RETURN TO THE OFFICE WILL DEPEND ON LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH ADVICE. AND IT ALSO DEPENDS ON WHETHER OR NOT PHYSICAL DISTANCING IS POSSIBLE IN THE WORKPLACE. IS IT SIMPLE? DOES ONE NEED PPE? WE NEED TO TAKE ALL OF THIS INTO ACCOUNT IN ORDER TO SUPPORT PUBLIC SERVANTS. I UNDERSTAND ONLY ONE QUESTION AND ONE FOLLOW-UP QUESTION. WE'LL MOVE TO QUESTIONS IN THE ROOM. [ .  Reporter: 36,000 YESTERDAY. WHAT IS YOUR ASSESSMENT OF THE HEALTH SITUATION IN THE STATES AND IF IT CONTINUES TO GET WORSE DOES THIS MEAN THE BORDER SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE CLOSED?  THE THING IS A VERY DYNAMIC SITUATION AND WE HAVE TO KEEP ASSESSING IT. OF COURSE, EVERY MONTH A RE VALUATION AND SO I THINK ABSOLUTELY WE NEED TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE EPIDEMIOLOGIST AND THE NUMBERS KEEP GOING UP AND THAT'S GOING TO DEFINITELY INFORM WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN NEXT AT THE BORDER. I WON'T PREEMPT THE NEXT DECISION BUT WATCHING THAT SITUATION EXTREMELY CLOSELY.  GOING BACK TO THE EARLIER STAGES OF THIS ONE OF THE ISSUES WITH PPE THAT WE HAD. AT ANY POINT DID YOU TELL THE PRIME MINISTER THE HEALTH MINISTER THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH IN THE NATIONAL STOCKPILE AND WARN THEM WE NEED TO SPEND MORE MONEY AND PROCURE MORE THINGS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC OR BEFORE IT TO WORRY ABOUT THE PANDEMIC?  I THINK THE PROCUREMENT OF PPE IS ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING ASPECTS. IT WAS PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT A LOT OF PPE IS REQUIRED AND THAT WE HAD ACTUALLY SMALL AMOUNTS OF THIS IN THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY STRATEGIC STOCKPILE THAT HASN'T BEEN THE CONSTRUCT OF THE TIMES. THAT WAS PRETTY NOTICEABLE EARLY ON. I THINK LOTS OF DIFFERENT EFFORT S AS PEOPLE HAVE SEEN TO TRY AND GET AS MUCH PROCUREMENT DONE AS POSSIBLE WITH PSPC. WHETHER IT'S OVERSEAS AND THEN RATCHETING UP CAPACITY HAS BEEN OBVIOUSLY A KEY ASPECT OF THE RESPONSE. PEOPLE TOOK THE NEED TO HAVE MORE PPE EXTREMELY SERIOUSLY VERY EARLY ON.  GOOD AFTERNOON. CANADA HAS SET UP A CONTACT GROUP TO INVESTIGATE OUTBREAKS AMONG FARM WORKERS IN ONTARIO BUT NOT STIFFENING PENALTY FORCE EMPLOYERS NOT FULFILLING OBLIGATIONS. WHY IS THAT?  THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION. I CAN PROVIDE SIMILAR VIEWS THE PRIME MINISTER HAS SHARED THIS MORNING AND PERHAPS TURN TO DR. TAM FOR MORE ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH SIDE. IT'S CLEAR THAT WITH WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST FEW DAYS, THE LAST WEEKS, CANADA OR THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB WHEN IT COMES TO WELCOMING AND TAKING CARE OF TEMPORARY FOREIGN WORKERS PARTICULARLY THOSE WORKING IN ON FARMS ACROSS CANADA. WE ARE AWARE THAT THE GUIDELINES AND THE EXPECTATIONS THAT WERE PROVIDED TO SOME OF THOSE WELCOMED AND HIRED TEMPORARY FOREIGN WORKERS, THE GUIDELINES AND IMPORTANT INQUIRY TO CARRY OUT APPROPRIATE SANCTIONS TO APPLY IF THOSE FAILURES DID HAPPEN. WHEN IT COMES TO THE BROADER ISSUE OF MAINTAINING APPROPRIATE RELATIONS WITH PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS LOCALLY WOULD PREFER TO TURN TO DR. TAM.  I UNDERSTAND IT OR THE MEASURES ARE LOOKED AT INCLUDING IF THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT NON COMPLIANCE BY EMPLOYERS OF TEMPORARY FARM WORKERS SANCTIONS CAN BE APPLIED. NOT NECESSARILY WITHIN THE REALM S OF PUBLIC HEALTH BUT ALL OF THESE ASPECTS NEED TO BE LOOK ED AT. MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO PROTECT TEMPORARY FARM WORKERS BECAUSE THEY ARE VITAL AT THIS POINT TO THE ECONOMY OF CANADA AND I THINK THE RISK FACTORS ARE OBVIOUS. THEY HAVE WORKING CONDITIONS IN SOME FARMS THAT NEED TO BE REVIEWED. THE CONGREGATE LIVING OR CROWDED CONDITIONS SOMETIMES LOW WAGE AND PRESENT THEMSELVESES WITH SYMPTOMS AND NOT GETTING PAID AND LANGUAGE BARRIERS IN TERMS OF COMPLYING WITH PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES. WE ARE IN CLOSE DISCUSSIONS WITH ONTARIO BUT ALSO THE LOCAL HEALTH UNITS TO LOOK AT WHAT MORE CAN BE DONE. CERTAINLY EVEN A SINGLE CASE VERY RAPID RESPONSE TOGETHER WITH WIDESPREAD TESTING NEEDS TO BE DONE VERY, VERY QUICKLY. BECAUSE OF SOME OF THESE CLOSE CONDITIONS WHERE DISEASE CAN SPREAD VERY QUICKLY. I THINK THE KEY IS TO SUPPORT THE TEMPORARY FARM WORKERS IN WHICH EVER WAY WE CAN. CERTAINLY GUIDANCE, FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO EMPLOYERS. SO PART OF OUR WORK GOING FORWARD ACTUALLY PROVIDING TECHNICAL SUPPORT TO SERVICE CANADA INSPECTORS SO THAT IF THEY ARE EXPECTING PREMISES TO ENSURE CONDITIONS ARE MET WE CAN GIVE THEM THAT TECHNICAL SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED TO DO THEIR JOB AS WELL.  AND JUST GOING TO SEEK CLARITY ON HOW THESE COVID-19 OUTBREAKS OCCUR AMONG THE MI GRANT WORKERS ESPECIALLY SINCE THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO SELF-ISOLATE FOR 14 DAYS. IS IT YOUR UNDERSTANDING THE 14 DAYS OF SELF-ISOLATION DID NOT HAPPEN AND REPORTS THAT MEXICAN FARM WORKERS HID THEIR SUPPORT WHEN THEY CAME TO CANADA. DOES THE GOVERNMENT HAVE INFORMATION TO SUPPORT THIS?  I THINK THE FACTORS ARE MULTIPLE. IN THE ONTARIO CONTEXT THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE IS WORKERS WERE RESPECTING THEIR 14 DAY QUARANTINE. NOW REMEMBER THAT'S THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THE 14 DAYS SO SOMEONE DOES COME YOU PICK THEM UP AND EXPECTED DURING THE 14 DAYS. PERHAPS THEY CAME IN WITH UN SUSPECTING ILLNESS BUT THAT'S WHY THE 14 DAY ISOLATION IS REQUIRED AND SOMETIMES WE'VE SEEN THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED IN ISOLATION AND QUARANTINE IN DIFFERENT LOCATION S SUCH AS A HOTEL. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT AFTER THAT PERIOD, THEY OFTEN GO BACK TO CONGREGATE LIVING CONDITIONS AND MORE CROWDED WORK SETTINGS AND SEEMS THAT AT LEAST IN SOME OF THESE CASES THAT'S WHAT IS HAPPENING AND, OF COURSE WORKERS DO MIX WITH SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES AS WELL. AND THAT IT'S DEFINITELY A POSSIBILITY THEY GET INFECTED BY THE LOCAL COMMUNITY AS WELL AND MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE SPREAD OF ILLNESS. THAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING SO BASED ON WHAT WE UNDERSTAND CURRENTLY HAPPENING WITH THE OUT BREAKS THE 14 DAY QUARANTINE PERIOD SEEMS TO BE WORKING BUT WE NEED TO KEEP GOING AND MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE SUPPORTED BEYOND THAT.  THANK YOU THANK YOU, DR. TAM. ONE LAST QUESTION ON THE PHONE. OPERATOR, OVER TO YOU.  OUR NEXT QUESTION FROM HYDRO CANADA. PLEASE GO AHEAD.  (Voice of Interpreter): THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON, MR. DUCLOS. REGARDING TELEWORK FOR PUBLIC SERVANTS, DO YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC DAY FOR PEOPLE TO RETURN TO THEIR OFFICES AND IF THERE IS NO SUCH DATE, CAN WE GET AN IDEA FOR WHEN WE CAN EXPECT A RETURN TO NORMAL WITH PEOPLE IN THEIR OFFICES, I MEAN. EVERYONE IN THEIR OFFICES. ARE WE GOING TO NEED A VACCINE FOR THAT? ANSWER. THE RETURN TO OFFICES IS GOING TO BE PROGRESSIVE, BUT IT SHOULD START SHORTLY. WE'RE NOT GOING TO WAIT FOR A VACCINE BEFORE ALLOWING THE PROGRESSIVE "RETURN OF XANDER CAGE" RETURN -- RETURN TO OFFICE S BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN WORKING SO WE WANT THIS RETURN TO THE OFFICE TO BE PROGRESSIVE BUT THERE WILL BE A MORE SIGNIFICANT ROLE FOR TELEWORK ORIGINALLY TELEWORK WAS THOUGHT TO BE UNUNPRODUCTIVE OR IMPOSSIBLE. UNPRODUCTIVE BECAUSE PUBLIC SERVANTS WERE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEEDED TO DO THEIR WORK BUT WE NOTICED THAT IN SOME CASES PRODUCTIVITY IS EVEN BETTER WHEN WE ALLOW PEOPLE TO WORK FROM HOME. IT REDUCED THE COST OF COMMUTING , WORKPLACE BALANCE BUT SOMETIMES IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO DO TELEWORK. I SUMMARIZED STATICS IN A FEW WEEKS WE NEED TELEWORK A LOT MORE POSSIBLE THAN BEFORE. THE PROGRESSIVE RETURN TO OFFICE S AND WE WANT, OF COURSE, FOR THE PRIORITY TO BE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF WORKERS. WE'RE NOT GOING BACK TO WHERE WE WERE BECAUSE THERE WILL BE MORE TELEWORK IN THE COMING MONTHS IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAN BEFORE THE CRISIS. A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION? SO CAN WE SAY THAT COVID-19 TRIGGERED A MORE LONG-TERM REFLECTION ON TELEWORK? CAN WE SAY THIS IS THE START OF A TIME WHERE WILL PEOPLE WILL BE INCREASINGLY WORKING AT HOME NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE OF COVID BUT BECAUSE ADVANTAGES TO TELEWORK. ANSWER. YES. IT'S MORE FLEXIBLE FOR EMPLOYEES IT'S MORE EFFICIENT FOR EMPLOYEE S SO MORE EFFICIENT FOR THE GOVERNMENT IN MANY CASES AND IN A LOT OF CASES IT IS LESS COSTLY FOR EMPLOYEES AND FOR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. LESS COSTLY FOR EMPLOYEES BECAUSE FEWER COSTS FOR COMMUT ING AND FOR OTHER THINGS AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE'VE STARTED REALLY REFLECTING ON THE NUMBER OF OFFICES AND THE NUMBER OF OFFICE SPACES THAT WE WANT OVER THE PAST OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS AS THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS DOING THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA IS ALSO REFLECTING ON THE TYPE OF WORKSPACES THAT WE WANT TO HAVE IN THE COMING YEARS. THANK YOU, MR. MINISTER.  THAT'S IT FOR TODAY. THANK YOU, EVERYONE.
