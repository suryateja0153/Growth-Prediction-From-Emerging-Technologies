 tonight growing concern that TSA checkpoints could become choke points on October 1st flights delayed passengers unable to leave or return home the nation's airports now warning of a looming meltdown so the nation's airports have told the administration this is a crisis and my message to them is act on it we can't wait any longer delay delay delay this thing the problem while states have now issued 95 million real IDs that's just 34% of the total two thirds of Americans have just over seven months to upgrade or risk not being able to fly nationwide DMV offices are packed with frustrated citizens trying to upgrade their licenses making appointments months in advance and bringing the required paperwork from New York I mean it's packed in there the lines out the door people are very upset frustrated to California I don't want to wait in a five-hour line so I had to take off today even with an appointment to get my real ID Congress passed the Real ID law after 9/11 to create a single national standard for all 50 states IDs that are verified from multiple sources and harder to counterfeit designated by a star or state logo but many states are behind New Jersey can't keep up Washington state suggests getting a passport is faster Oklahoma won't start issuing real IDs until April 30th Oregon won't start until July if we worked 24/7 we'd have to do seven a minute to get the number of licenses out by October but there's no way that we could do 7 a minute tonight no indication that homeland security will extend the deadline but is considering ways to speed up the process Thomas raises so many questions chief among them if the administration doesn't move this October 1st deadline what options are there for passengers travelers could still use a military ID a federal ID a passport or a Global Entry card if they don't have a real ID hey NBC News fans thanks for checking out our youtube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down here and click on any of the videos over here to watch the latest interviews show highlights and digital exclusives thanks for watching
