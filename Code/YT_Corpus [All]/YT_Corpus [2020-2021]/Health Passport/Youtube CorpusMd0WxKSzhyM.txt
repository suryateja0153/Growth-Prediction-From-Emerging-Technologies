outdoors banned to name just a few of the coveted restrictions that have put life on hold for tens of millions sadly there is no shortage of business at hospitals but the urgent measures to ease the strain on icus being met with resistance including among some of those charged with enforcing the rules let's begin with miguel almaguer in los angeles tonight in california as covid cases skyrocket and open icu beds drop to critically low levels a new lockdown has been triggered for 33 million people implementing the nation's toughest restrictions the new mandates prohibit any mixing of households even for a walk outside retail businesses including pharmacies must cap capacity at 20 percent they didn't have any toilet paper they were out of bottled water amid the frenzy to buy basics hair and nail salons are also forced to shutter again but at least seven county sheriffs say they won't enforce the new mandates the riverside county sheriff's department will not be blackmailed bullied or used as muscle against riverside county residents and now with more businesses closed in california recording a record 34 thousand infections in a single day leading authorities are relaying mixed messages over the state's lockdown when you have the challenge to the health care system you've got to do something like that i think we could be causing a lot more harm by overly restrictive recommendations as division grows deeper in new york indoor dining could be rolled back while today michigan extended their restrictions officials now warning the next holiday surge could be worse and then you have another celebration on new year's that extends that vulnerable period by two or three times what you do in thanksgiving in massachusetts a field hospital ready to serve more than 200 covid patients is now up and running but as cases reach a record high nationwide staff is running critically low we can make space we can't make critical care nurses tonight the fight against covet is dire as ever as is the battle against restrictions miguel almaguer nbc news los angeles the trump administration says it is ready to set the wheels in motion for the biggest mass vaccination program in the nation's history as soon as this week in an interview with me late today health and human services secretary alex azar played down concerns over potential vaccine shortages and he described the first hours after the fda approval of a vaccine it'll go to places like cvs walgreens hospitals community health centers or public health labs for distribution walk me through your expectations of where this will take us say middle of next year each week we'll be able to vaccinate more and more people be thinking of our most vulnerable citizens like our seniors in nursing homes or our front line health care workers and as we move forward we'll just see tens and tens of millions of more people getting vaccinated eventually general vaccination programs and by the second quarter of next year we believe we'll have enough vaccine across all of those manufacturers for every american who would like to be vaccinated i know in the pfizer deal the government agreed to pay for 100 million doses and perhaps 500 million beyond that to your knowledge has the government taken the option to buy more of what now appears to be a very successful vaccine so lester you're correct across the six different vaccine manufacturers that we placed contracts with uh with each of them we guaranteed the purchase of a hundred million doses of vaccine so that we would have 600 million doses of vaccine across a broad portfolio with pfizer we have an option to buy an additional 500 million more i'm not able to reveal discussions around potential procurements because that's what we call procurement sensitive information but we are continuing to work across manufacturers to expand the availability of releasable fda approved vaccine as quickly as possible do you still have that option for the 500 million or is that window closed we do still have that that option for an additional 500 million doses there's word that the president is going to sign an executive order tomorrow uh ensuring that americans are prioritized before any further vaccine leaves the country to help other countries is that an acknowledgement that you may be facing a shortage of vaccine no we are prioritizing the manufacture of vaccine here in america and the procurement of that vaccine for the benefit of americans but we've also been clear that once the american people's needs are met we will have excess vaccine we will make that available to the rest of the world is it your understanding that those who have had coveted those who currently have the antibodies because of an infection that they will be excluded from vaccines lester you know that's a really good question and that's something that the fda has not ruled on and cdc has not ruled on yet in terms of providing guidance so as of right now those who have the antibodies have been infected they would not have a place in line for the vaccine is that what you're saying uh no i'm not saying either included or excluded i have actually explicitly asked the fda for advice on this question because it has come up and it's an excellent question isaiah azar also told me scientists don't yet know how many people will need to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity but they expect a virus slowdown to occur week by week and within hours what could be a turning point of the pandemic as the uk begins vaccinating its citizens here's richard engel with that they've arrived under tight controls the pfizer vaccine may be the world's most valuable product right now interpol worries the doses could be stolen or counterfeited for the black market but so far they've all made it to the uk around eight hundred thousand doses ready for injections starting early tomorrow it's the moment caregivers here have been waiting for nervous excited that there's something out there that can protect us as well as our patients 50 hospitals have been designated as distribution centers because like this one they have the cold storage the pfizer vaccine requires eligible for the first round front line medical workers people over 80 and residents of retirement homes medical staff are running through drills i can't hold them in my hands because they are minor 70 degrees but to know that they are here and we are amongst the first in the country to actually receive the vaccine and therefore the first in the world is just amazing to boost confidence british media report the 94 year old queen elizabeth and 99 year old prince philip may take the vaccine soon no confirmation from the palace russia and china are already giving out their own vaccines but public health officials warn they haven't gone through sufficient testing and lack public data about their safety the pfizer vaccine has met all the safety checks so tomorrow
