 i want to bring in dr francis collins he's the director of the national institutes of health dr collins thank you for being with us look having a vaccine is terrific it's not the same as distributing a vaccine and what we have here is some complexity with some of the vaccines including the pfizer vaccine before we talk about distribution i want to talk about a different issue polling that indicates there are a number of americans who are worried about a vaccine you and i have had this conversation before i have said that before i take a vaccine i'm going to check with you but 42 percent of americans recently polled by gallup say uh they would not agree to be vaccinated for covet uh what what do you make of that number uh and how do we get it lower well i think that reflects that this has been a tumultuous time as this vaccine is being prepared as people are concerned about whether it's being prepared in a way that's politically driven as opposed to scientifically that maybe corners are being cut once again aly i want to reassure anybody who's listening that this is being done in a fashion that is absolutely focused on safety and efficacy plus nothing else politics have nothing to do with this we have done this at exceptional speed by figuring out ways to deal with some of the downtime that normally takes eight years to get a vaccine and now here we are on the brink of having two of them probably approved in less than a year but that has not sacrificed in any way the rigor that's been attached to assessing these and large-scale trials involving 30 000 or more people being assessed scientifically with no political interference what i'm hoping is that when people see the evidence for the safety and efficacy and that's going to be very publicly declared in the coming weeks when the fda has their open meetings about this they will be reassured that this is something that can be trusted and will be safe for them and their families and can save potentially hundreds of thousands of lives and i want people to understand coming from you the reason i said i'm going to ask you is because you you come from a long line of uh of medical work and scientific work you were the head of the human genome project so you know what you speak so i believe you on that so let's put the politics out of it for a moment because i think you're right that that was a big part of it there's another part of it that that troubles me as well and that is the news on the pfizer medication the vaccine the news on the modern vaccine and the news of uh the astrazeneca vaccine most of it has come from the companies not peer-reviewed articles not regulatory bodies and we did find out there was a mistake uh with the astrazeneca uh uh data that was presented what happens is these companies declare whatever they declare the stock goes up we find out that some executives in the company sold some stock and that also contributes to this idea that am i getting my information about the efficacy and safety of these vaccines the way i should be getting them in a normal world we wouldn't be getting it through press release either and again this is not a normal world is it and everybody's anxious to find out the information but i want to again reassure people when the company says we see 95 efficacy they say that based upon the work of a group of independent scientists in what's called the data and safety monitoring board the dsmb they're the only people that look at the unblinded data to see whether the vaccine works they see it before the company does and then if they see something that looks like a good result they tell the company look what we've got here and then the company gets as you might imagine excited because they want to succeed too and they make a press release about it but the actual observation does not come initially from them but from this group of independent scientists who we actually know really well and trust completely i know it maybe make people a little uneasy and the data does need to be published in a peer-reviewed journal and it will be that takes a few weeks and right now nobody wants to wait a few weeks to find out what's happening so part of it is just the pressure to get cancer dr collins i always appreciate it you're always reassuring to me uh dr francis collins is the director of the national institutes of health we appreciate your time this morning as always yeah sure why not i'll take all your suggestions sure we still need people to participate in clinical trials for vaccines there are four more of them in the works and for trials for people who are infected there's a new website which is going to get put forward on monday but i'll tell you about it now combatcovid.hhs.gov it's one stop shopping for people who are interested in taking part in trials and helping us get the answers combatcovid.hhs.gov i tell you what i will tweet this out and i'll put your uh handle in the twitter and and we'll send this out to people if they want to be involved in cova trials that was a really good thing to remind me of thank you for that dr collins as always dr francis collins is director of the national institutes of health and i will tweet out that website hey there i'm chris hayes from msnbc thanks for watching msnbc on youtube if you want to keep up to date with the videos
