 AND HE IS THE HEAD OF ADAPTIVE ONCOLOGY AT THE ONTARIO INSTITUTE FOR CANCER RESEARCH AND HE IS GOING TO BE TALKING TO US ABOUT HOW OPEN SOURCE HAS CHANGED THE WORLD. MOST OF YOU HAVE PROBABLY AT LEAST HEARD OF LINCOLN. HE’S A PILLAR OF THE BIOINFORMATICS COMMUNITY. HE WAS AWARDED THE BEN FRANKLIN AWARD FOR OPEN ACCESS IN BIOINFORMATICS IN 2004. HE WAS NAMED AN ISCB FELLOW AND ONE OF THE WORLD’S MOST INFLUENTIAL SCIENTIFIC MIND AND THE LIST OF PROJECTS HE’S LED INCLUDES SON. OF THE GREATEST HIT OF BIOINFORMATICS. AND FINALLY, IT IS MY PERSONAL PLEASURE TO WELCOME LINCOLN BACK TO DO ANOTHER KEYNOTE 20 YEARS AGO AT OUR VERY FIRST BOSC IN 2000. SO, OVER TO YOU, LINCOLN. LINCOLN: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, NOMI. I HAVE A TERRIBLE HISTORY OF CREATING THESE GRANDIOSING SOUNDING TITLES AND FAILING TO DELIVER. SO I DECIDED THAT THIS TIME, I WAS GOING TO HAVE A -- CHANGE THE TITLE AT THE LAST MINUTE TO SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT MORE MODEST. SO I HAVE NEVER USED A SHARING FUNCTION. CAN YOU JUST TELL ME WHETHER YOU CAN SEE MY SCREEN. HELLO? OK. ALL RIGHT. CAN YOU -- CAN EVERYONE SEE MY SCREEN? I’M ASSUMING SO. I’M NOT HEARING ANYTHING. OK. SO, YEAH, I’M GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO ACCELERATE THE PROCESS OF SHARING A HUMAN BIOMEDICAL DATA RESEARCH IN FOR -- FOR HUMAN PATIENTS AND I’M GOING TO PUT IN THE CONTEXT OF FLATTENING THE CURVE. SO WE GO BACK TO MARCH 16 OF 2020, WHICH WAS THE FIRST DAY THAT THE CITY OF TORONTO ENTERED ITS COVID-RELATED LOCKDOWN. THIS IS THE FRONT PAGE FROM THE "TORONTO STAR" ON THAT DAY. AND KIND OF AMAZINGLY, JUST ABOUT A WEEK LATER, THIS WEBSITE APPEARED, CALLED "FLATTEN.CA" WHICH IS A COVID-19 INFORMATION PORTAL. THERE WAS -- THIS WAS A TIME WHEN THERE WAS NO INFORMATION ABOUT WHO WAS GETTING COVID-19, WHAT THE RISK FACTORS WERE, THE PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCY OF ONTARIO WAS COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED. DIDN’T KNOW WHAT TO DO. AND YET THIS SITE SUDDENLY APPEARED. AND WHAT IT DID WAS TO -- IT WAS A PATIENT-INITIATED RESEARCH PORTAL. ANYBODY COULD LOG INTO THIS AND THEY WOULD ENTER THEIR SYMPTOMS, WHETHER THEY HAD A COUGH, WHETHER THEY HAD A FEVER, A FAMILY HISTORY INFORMATION, DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION, AND VERY IMPORTANTLY, THE FIRST THREE CHARACTERS OF THEIR POSTAL CODE, WHICH GIVES YOU A REGION THAT SEVERAL CITY BLOCKS IN SIZE, A FEW HUNDRED FAMILIES AND THERE WAS ALSO WAYS TO ENTER COVID-19 TESTING RESULTS. AND THEN THIS DATA WAS COLLECTED AND PUT ON TO AN INTERACTIVE HEAT MAP SO YOU COULD LOOK TO SEE, YOU KNOW, WHERE THERE WERE CLUSTERS OF CASES OR PEOPLE THAT HAD SUSPICIOUS SYMPTOMS. SO DARKER AREAS HERE INDICATING CLUSTERS OF PEOPLE WITH SYMPTOMS AND RISK FACTORS AND FOR THE MAN ON THE STREET, YOU COULD ASK HOW IS MY NEIGHBORHOOD DOING? IS THERE A LOT OF COVID OR COVID-RELATED SYMPTOMS HERE? HEALTH OFFICIALS COULD LOOK AT THIS AND SAY WHAT AREAS ARE THERE SUSPICIOUS CLUSTERS THAT MAY HAVE LATENT OUTBREAKS? AND LASTLY, THE DATA WAS AVAILABLE TO RESEARCHERS TO DEVELOP PREDICTIVE MODELS. WHAT SYMPTOMS AND RISK FACTORS PREDICT THAT THERE WILL BE AN EPIDEMIC HERE, AN OUTBREAK HERE, IN A WEEK, IN ONE TO TWO WEEKS? THEY ALSO PUT UP A NICE INTERACTIVE DASHBOARD WHERE THEY’RE SHOWING AGGREGATED DATA FROM MULTIPLE PUBLIC -- MULTIPLE PUBLIC SITES. I’M JUST MAKING SURE THAT THERE’S NO -- NOBODY’S CHATTING TO ME TELLING ME YOU CAN’T SEE MY SLIDES. OK. VERY GOOD. OK. THIS WHOLE SYSTEM WAS BUILT MOSTLY FROM OPEN SOURCE COMPONENTS. IT USES THE WEB PACK ASSET BUNDLER. A BUNCH OF LIBRARIES FROM GOOGLE’S OPEN SOURCE WEB DEVELOPMENT TOOLKIT, BASE MAPS FOR THE HEAT MAP, OPEN STREET MAPS DATA. THE ONLY LIBRARY THAT I FOUND THAT I DON’T THINK IS OPEN SOURCE IS USING THE PAPER FORMS, FORMS LIBRARY. BUT OTHER THAN THAT, IT WAS COMPLETELY AN OPEN SOURCE SYSTEM. AND THIS SITE WENT VIRAL VERY QUICKLY. IN ITS FIRST WEEK, IT HAD 300,000 RESPONDENTS. IT RECEIVED NATIONAL MEDIA ATTENTION FROM MULTIPLE REGIONAL AND NATIONAL NEWSPAPERS. IT QUICKLY GOT SUPPORT FROM THE GOOGLE CLOUD, FROM THE VECTOR INSTITUTE FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, A SERIES OF FUNDING AGENCIES IN CANADA. THE WHOLE CITY OF MONTREAL TOOK THE PLATFORM, MIRRORED IT AND ADOPTED IT AS ITS COVID-19 AND IT WAS ADOPTED BY AN AID GROUP TO SUPPORT PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORT IN SOMALIA. SO WHO ARE THE PEOPLE BEHIND THIS AMAZING WEBSITE? WELL, IT WAS, SURPRISINGLY, NOT PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERT, NOT SENIOR SOFTWARE ENGINEERS OR A.I. PEOPLE. IT WAS A FIRST-YEAR ENGINEERING STUDENT AT THE TORONTO OF TORONTO NAMED TRAY JANE AND A NUMBER OF VOLUNTEERS AND FRIENDS ALL UNDERGRADUATES FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO, WATERLOO AND HAMILTON. STARTED OUT AT SIX PEOPLE AT THE BEGINNING AND IT GROWS TO 30 IN JULY AND THE SITE IS STILL GOING STRONG. AND THIS IS AN OPEN SOURCE SUCCESS STORY. IT WENT UP IN A WEEK. IT WAS IMMEDIATELY USEFUL IN CONFRONTING A HEALTH CRISIS. SINCE THEN, THERE HAVE BEEN WELL FUNDED EFFORTS TO CREATE A SITE LIKE THIS BUT REALLY, NEITHER CANADA’S FEDERAL OR PROVERBIAL AGENCIES HAVE REALLY CAUGHT UP WITH THE ELEGANCE AND SIMPLICITY OF THIS SYSTEM. AND TO BE HONEST, I WAS COMPLETELY GREEN WITH ENVY BECAUSE DURING THAT FIRST WEEK OF COVID-19, I HAD STARTED WORKING ON A GRANT APPLICATION TO CREATE SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR TO THIS AND BY THE TIME I SUBMITTED THE APPLICATION, FLATTEN.CA HAD GONE UP AND IT WAS NO LONGER NECESSARY. A HANDFUL OF UNDERGRAD ACHIEVED WHAT OTHERS WERE NOT ABLE TO. SO LET’S COMPARE THE -- LET’S LOOK AT WHAT IT TAKES IN THE ACADEMIC WORLD TO CREATE A DATA SHARING PORTAL LIKE THIS. SO LET’S SAY YOU’RE REALLY GOOD AND YOU COULD WRITE A GRANT IN A WEEK. AND THEN YOU SUBMIT IT FOR PEER REVIEW AND UNDER ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES, IT WILL TAKE NINE MONTHS FOR REVIEW AND FUNDING. IN THE WEEKS OF THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK, THERE WERE VARIOUS FUNDING AGENCIES ANNOUNCED ACCELERATED-RELATED GRANTS THAT WOULD TAKE ABOUT SIX WEEKS FOR APPROVAL. THEN THE REAL PROBLEM WAS THAT BECAUSE YOU’RE DEALING WITH PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION FROM HUMANS AND I REALLY ENVY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL WORKING IN THE MODEL ORGANISM WORLD HERE, YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH ETHICS BOARD REVIEWS. ONE FOR EACH INSTITUTION THAT YOU AND YOUR COLLABORATIVES BELONGED TO AND EACH OF THESE CAN TAKE EIGHT OR 12 WEEKS. THAT’S ANOTHER TWO TO THREE MONTHS OF DELAY. AND FINALLY FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS, MAYBE ONE TO TWO WEEKS OF IMPLEMENTATION. SO MAYBE YOU CAN SKIP THE GRANT, THE FUNDING PART AND JUST USE OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDING OR INSTITUTIONAL FUNDING FOR THIS. YOU WOULD STILL COME UP WITH THIS BIG BOTTLENECK ON THE ETHICS BOARD REVIEWS. AND I DON’T WANT TO KNOCK THE IMPORTANCE OF INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARDS. I THINK THEY’RE VERY IMPORTANT TO PROTECTING PATIENTS. BUT I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT FLATTEN.CA MAY NOT HAVE, PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE SURVIVED ITS ETHICS REVIEW. IF YOU GO TO THE FLATTEN.CA SITE, THERE IS A STATEMENT THAT SAYS IF YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT USING THIS SITE, PLEASE CHECK OUR TERMS OF SERVICE. AND WHEN YOU CHECK THE TERMS OF SERVICE, THERE’S A PARAGRAPH THAT SAYS YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ALL INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE TO US WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE PUBLICLY THROUGH OUR WEBSITE AND OUR HEAT MAPS IN AN EFFORT TO HELP HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, RESEARCHERS AND OTHERS IN THEIR EFFORTS TO FIGHT COVID-19. AND IF YOU DO NOT LIKE THESE TERMS, DON’T USE THE PLATFORM, BUT WE’D LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU ANYWAY. AND THIS IS -- THIS IS REALLY KIND OF PROBLEMATIC. IT’S NOT SOMETHING THAT THE I.R.B. WOULD ALLOW THROUGH. FIRST OF ALL, IT WAS IMPLICIT ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS OF USE. YOU GO THROUGH THE SITE, YOU NOW HAVE TO CLICK THROUGH THE AGREEMENT, YOU HAVE TO SEEK OUT THE TERMS OF USE LINK AND CLICK ON IT. THE INFORMED CONSENT THERE IS INADEQUATE. IT DOESN’T SAY EXACTLY WHO WILL BE USING PARTICIPANTS’ PERSONAL HEALTH DATA. WHAT PURPOSES DOES THE DATA BE USED FOR? IT DOESN’T ANSWER THAT. HOW LONG WILL THE DATA BE RETAINED? WHO OWNS THE DATA? DO THE PARTICIPANTS HAVE THE RIGHT TO WITHDRAW THE DATA? THERE ARE A WHOLE SERIES OF CHECKLIST THAT HAS TO GO THAT I.R.B.’S LOOK AT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PATIENT HAS INFORMED CONSENT AND UNDERSTANDS THE RISKS AND BENEFITS AND HAS AGREED. THERE’S NO OBVIOUS RIGHT OF REDRESS IF THE DATA IS MISUSED. AND THEY SAY THAT THEY’RE GOING TO MAKE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO AVOID REDISTRIBUTEDING RECORD LEVEL DATA, BUT IS THAT REALLY SUFFICIENT? AND FINALLY IS COLLECTION OF THREE-DIGIT POSTAL CODE SUFFICIENT TO PROTECT THE IDENTITY OF PARTICIPANTS? IN A CITY, THERE MAY BE 1,000 PEOPLE WHERE THE SAME THREE--DIGIT POSTAL CODE BUT IN REMOTE PARTS OF CANADA, RURAL CANADA AND RURAL AREAS, THAT MAY ONLY BE A FEW DOZENS OF PEOPLE. AND THEN FINALLY, IT REALLY ISN’T CLEAR FROM FLATTEN.CA WHETHER THE DATA REALLY IS AVAILABLE FOR RESEARCH. WHEN YOU GO TO THE SITE, THE ONLY WAY THAT THEY HAVE DISTRIBUTING THE SURVEY RESULTS IS THIS HEAT MAP. THERE’S NO LINK ANYWHERE TO DOWNLOAD THE DATA OR TO CONTACT PEOPLE TO GET THE DATA. SO IT REALLY ISN’T CLEAR HOW THE DATA’S BEING USED, WHO IT IS AVAILABLE TO AND IF YOU’RE A RESEARCHER, HOW IN FACT DO YOU GET THIS DATA TO BUILD A PREDICTIVE MODEL OF COVID-19 INFECTION THAT THE SITE WAS DESIGNED TO ANSWER? SO ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU KNOW, PUBLIC HEALTH DATA HAS A DIFFERENT TRADITION. AND, YOU KNOW, IN MANY CASES, THEY DON’T ASK FOR INFORMED CONSENT. THIS IS ACTUALLY A DIFFERENT SITE. THIS IS THE ONTARIO PUBLIC DATA CATALOG FROM THE ONTARIO GOVERNMENT. AND THEY ACTUALLY PUBLIC ALL THEIR COVID-19 TESTING RESULTS IN A BIG SPREADSHEET THAT YOU CAN ACCESS. AND AS YOU CAN SEE, IT LISTS EACH INDIVIDUAL, THE DATE THEY WERE TESTED, WHERE THEY LIVE AND IT EVEN -- THEIR SEX AND AGE RANGE AND IT EVEN HAS LONGITUDE AND LAT TUTE INFORMATION AND SIX-LETTERED POSTAL CODES WHICH IS DOWN TO THE EAST OR WEST SIDE OF THE STREET. SO I DON’T WANT TO -- I DON’T WANT TO CRITICIZE FLATTEN.CA FOR BEING TOO FREE WITH PATIENT DATA, IN FACT, THEY’RE MUCH LESS FREE WITH THE DATA THAN TO THE ONTARIO PUBLIC HEALTH IS. SO THE REST OF THE TALK, I’M GOING TO -- I AM GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW CAN WE ACHIEVE WHAT FLATTEN.CA DID OR TRY TO -- TRIED TO DO IN A RESPONSIBLE, FAST AND EFFECTIVE FASHION. CREATING A INVESTIGATED PATIENT DATA SETS AND DISTRIBUTING THEM IN A FRICTIONLESS WAY TO THE COMMUNITY FOR SECONDARY RESEARCH. SO I JUST WANT TO START OUT BY POINTING OUT THAT MULTIPLE SURVEYS OF PATIENTS’ ATTITUDES TOWARDS PARTICIPATING IN BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH SHOW A VERY POSITIVE -- SHOW THAT PATIENTS BY AND LARGE ARE OVERWHELMINGLY IN FAVOR OF SHARING THEIR PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION. HERE IS A 2016 STUDY FROM THE BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL. AND IT SHOWED THAT MORE THAN 80% OF THE PATIENTS THAT THEY SURVEYED HAD A POSITIVE ATTITUDE TOWARDS PARTICIPATING IN A CLINICAL TRIAL. 10% HAD NO OPINION AND ONLY 10% HAD A NEGATIVE ATTITUDE. 8 % -- 84% OF THE ONES WHO HAD A POSITIVE ATTITUDE SAID THAT MAKING DATA FROM A CLINICAL TRIAL WAS VERY IMPORTANT OR IMPORTANT TO THEM. SO THEY WANTED TO PUBLICIZE THEIR DATA. AND 63% SAID THAT IF THE INVESTIGATOR FAILED TO MAKE THE DATA PUBLIC, THAT WOULD MAKE THEM LESS LIKELY TO PARTICIPATE. SO THERE’S A VERY STRONG PRIOR FOR PATIENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN CLINICAL TRIALS FOR THEIR DATA TO BE COLLECTED AND FOR THAT DATA TO BE SHARED WIDELY WITH THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY. SO I’M THINKING ABOUT HOW NO DO THIS, YESTERDAY I WAS GOING TO WITH MY FAMILY TO THE ONTARIO FARMERS MARKET. YOU CAN SEE PEOPLE ARE MASKED UP HERE AND TRYING TO SOCIAL DISTANCE AS WELL AS THEY CAN. AND I RAN INTO THIS GUY. THE NAME IS SETH. AND HE IS A -- HE RUNS A COMPANY CALLED FORBES WILD FOODS AND HE AND HIS STAFF ARE FORAGERS. THEY GO OUT AND -- INTO BARKS AND BERRIES AND LEAVES. THEY PACKAGE THEM IN SYRUPS AND SO ON. THEY PACKAGE THEM NICELY AND THEY SELL THEM AT THE FARMERS MARKET AND AT ORGANIC STORES TO CONSUMERS. AND THERE’S A GREAT DEAL OF KNOWLEDGE THAT GOES INTO FORGING EFFECTIVELY. YOU HAVE TO -- FORAGING EFFECTIVELY. YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHERE THE PLANTS GROW, WHEN THEY’RE OUT. WHICH ONES ARE POISONOUS AND WHICH ONES ARE GOOD FOR YOU, HOW TO COMBINE THEM, HOW TO GATHER AND STORE THEM AND SO ON. AND IT REMINDED ME VERY MUCH OF WHAT ABOUT THE SORT OF THING THAT I AND MY COLLEAGUES DO. WE’RE DATA FORAGERS. WE LOOK AT THE LITERATURE. WE SEE A PAPER COME OUT. WE TRY TO FIND OUT WHERE THAT DATA SET IS. WE TRY TO EVALUATE WHETHER IT’S A GOOD DATA SET OR IT’S A POISONOUS DATA SET AND THEN WE INTEGRAL INVESTIGATE THEM, PUT THEM OUT SBO INTO PORTALS AND TRY TO MAKE THEM ASSESS TO BELIEVE THE COMMUNITY. NOW FORAGING IS A VERY LABOR-INTENSIVE AND NON-SCALABLE TASK. HOW DO WE GO FROM A FORAGING MODEL TO A FARM-TO-TABLE MODEL WHERE THERE’S A GROUP OF RESEARCHERS WHO DESIGN THE STUDY, HARVEST THE DATA IN A SYSTEMIC WAY, PUBLIC IT IN -- SYSTEMATIC WAY, PUBLIC IT IN A SERIES OF DATA ARCHIVES AND THEN A SECONDARY GROUP OF SCIENTISTS SERVE THE DATA OUT TO THE ULTIMATE CONSUMERS OF THE DATA. SO WHAT DO WE NEED DO TO GO FROM A FORAGER MODEL TO A FARM-TO-TABLE MODEL? AND SO IN THIS TALK, I’M GOING TO TALK ABOUT SIX DIFFERENT MECHANISMS TO DO THIS. SO ONE IS AT THE ENTRY POINT FOR SAN DIEGO STATE TO MAKE THE I.R.B., THE INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD PROCESS FASTER AND MORE EFFICIENT AND MORE EFFECTIVE. SECOND, HOW DO WE -- HOW DO WE TAKE THE GUESSWORK OUT OF PATIENT CONSENT FORMS AND TURN THEM INTO SOMETHING STANDARDIZED AND PREDICTABLE? THIRD, HOW DO WE SHARE DATA SETS ON THE CLOUD TO MAKE THEM FINDABLE USING DATA SET REGISTRYS AND SEARCH SERVICES? FOURTH, HOW DO WE -- HOW DO WE YOU’D META DATA THAT CAN BE FINDEN IN A STANDARDIZED AND PREDICTIVE WAY. AND THEN WHEN IT COMES TIME TO FOR RESEARCHERS TO ACCESS THE DATA, HOW DO WE USE STANDARDIZED DATA USAGE AGREEMENTS THAT ARE MACHINE READABLE IN ORDER TO DECIDE IF A RESEARCHER’S PROPOSED -- PROPOSED USE OF THE DATA IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PATIENT CONSENT AND THE STUD DESIGN? AND FINALLY I WILL TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT A REGISTER DATA ACCESS SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS RESPONSIBLE RESEARCHERS CARTE BLANCHE TO ACCESS THE SUBSET OF DATA SETS. SO THE CURRENT INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD PROCESS FOR COLLABORATIVE PROJECTS IS -- WAS DESIGNED IN THE 20TH CENTURY AND IT’S REALLY, REALLY CLUNKY AND SLOW. SO MOST RESEARCH PROJECTS, MOST BIG RESEARCH PROJECTS THESE DAYS HAVE MULTIPLE INVESTIGATORS FROM DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS. EACH OF THEM HAS TO GO THROUGH HIS OWN INSTITUTION -- HIS OWN INSTITUTION’ I.R.B. SO THIS IS TYPICALLY A FULL REVIEW THAT TAKES BETWEEN WEEKS TO MONTHS AT THE PRINCIPLE INVESTIGATOR’S INSTITUTION AND THEN IF IT’S APPROVED, THERE’S A SHORTER PROCESS CALLED AN ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW AT EACH OF THE COLLABORATOR’S INSTITUTIONS. AND THOSE MAY TAKE -- THOSE ARE NOT DONE BY THE FULL BOARD. THEY’RE USUALLY TWO TO FOUR-WEEK PROCESS BY A SUBSET OF THE BOARD. AND AFTER THIS GOES THROUGH, YOU WILL ADD UP ANOTHER MONTH OR TWO. THE PROJECT CAN GET STARTED THIS IS IGNORING DATA TRANSFER AGREEMENTS AND CONTRACTS AND SO FORTH. BUT AT A MINIMUM, YOU’RE LOOKING AT THREE TO FOUR MONTHS BEFORE A PROJECT THAT COLLECTS AND SHARES HUMAN DATA CAN ACTUALLY GET STARTED. THERE ARE MULTIPLE WHAT IS THAT THIS CAN BE APPROVED. THE BIG BOTTLENECKS ARE THAT FIRST OF ALL, I.R.B. PANELISTS ARE VOLUNTEERS, WHO HAVE THEY OWN LABS. THEY’RE PERFORMING SERVICE WORK. THEY HAVE LIMIT TIME. FULL I.R.B.’S MAY NOT MEET BUT ONCE A MONTH OR ONCE EVERY OTHER MONTH. EACH RESEARCHER HAS TO OBTAIN AN I.R.B. APPROVAL. EVERY I.R.B. HAS A DIVOT SET OF PROTOCOLS FOR APPLICATION AND REVIEWING AND EACH APPLICATION MUST BE REVIEWED BY HAND AND THE MOST TIME-CONSUMING PROCESS OF THIS IS REVIEWING THE CONSENT MATERIAL TO ENSURE PATIENT -- FULLY INFORMED PATIENT CONSENT. AND ALTHOUGH THE ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEWS DO HELP SPEED UP THIS PROCESS, THEY STILL GENERATE EXTENSIVE PAPERWORK AND SAP TIME BOTH IN PREPARATION AND IN REVIEW. SO ONE, YOU KNOW, SO ONE WAY OF SPEEDING THIS UP IS TO DE-EMPHASIZE THE INDIVIDUAL INSTITUTION’S I.R.B.’S AND INSTEAD, SET UP A SERIES OF LARGE CENTRALIZED REGIONAL I.R.B.’S. WHERE THE PRINCIPLE INVESTIGATOR INSTITUTION A, AND ALL THE CO-APPLICANTS AT THEIR INSTITUTIONS SUBMIT A SINGLE APPLICATION TO THE REGIONAL I.R.B., WHICH THEN REVIEWS THE ENTIRE -- THE ENTIRE APPLICATION AND ISSUES AN APPROVAL THAT IS VALID FOR ALL INSTITUTIONS. AND THE INDIVIDUAL I.R.B.’S ALLOW FOR -- HAVE DELEGATED THEIR RESPONSIBILITY, THEY WILL ACCEPT THE REGIONAL I.R.B.’S DECISION. AND THE BIG ADVANTAGE OF THIS IS THAT IF YOU THEN GO TO ADD A NEW CENTER TO A PREVIOUSLY APPROVED STUDY, YOU’RE BRINGING ON A NEW COLLABORATOR, THEY ALSO BENEFIT. THERE’S NOT A SECOND I.R.B. APPROVAL PROCESS. THERE’S JUST A QUICK AMENDMENT THAT TAKES A COUPLE OF DAYS TO ADD THEM IN TO REGISTER THEM. HERE’S A REAL WORLD EXAMPLE THAT’S WORKING. MY INSTITUTION IS DUE FOR CANCER RESEARCH HAS SPONSORED FOR THE PAST DECADE AN ENTITY CALLED OCREB. IT’S BEEN GRANTED AUTHORITY BY THE PROVINCE TO APPROVE MULTI- CENTERED CANCER TRIALS THROUGHOUT ONTARIO. ANY CLINICAL TRIAL IS ELIGIBLE FOR REVIEW. THEY DO A 10-WEEK TURNAROUND. IT IS REQUIRED FOR FULL BOARD APPROVAL AND WHEN NEW BOARDS ARE ADDED TO THE TRIAL, IT IS A TWO TO THREE-DAY TURNAROUND. THIS IS ALSO A PILOT PROJECT TO ALLOW FOR RECIPROCAL APPROVAL WITH A SIMILAR ENTITY IN MANITOBA, WHICH THEN WOULD ALLOW MULTI-CENTER TRIALS TO BE CONDUCTED IN MANITOBA AND ONTARIO UNDER A SINGLE UMBRELLA. THERE’S NO REASON THIS COULDN’T BE EXPANDED TO ALL -- TO ALL OF CANADA PROVIDED THAT THE PATIENT PRIVATE PROTECTION LAWS ARE CONSISTENT FROM ONE PROVINCE TO THE NEXT. THE 10 WEEKS, HOWEVER, IS STILL A LONG TIME AND IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT’S TAKING THAT 10 WEEKS, A LOT OF IT IS READING THE CONSENTS AND TRY AND GOING -- AND GOING THROUGH THEM IN DETAIL. EACH CONSENT IS A THING ON TO ITSELF. IT’S CREATED AN AD HOC WAY AND IT HAS DIFFERENT NON-STANDARDIZED LANGUAGE. AND THE THINGS THAT THE I.R.B.’S LOOKING LIKE FOR ARE WHO WILL THE DATA BE SHARED FOR? IS IT -- ARE THERE FOR-PROFIT ENTITIES INVOLVED? WAS THE PATIENT INFORMED OF THAT? WHAT PURPOSES WILL THE DATA BE USED FOR? WHAT ARE ITS ALLOWABLE USES? HOW WILL THE DATA BE MANAGED AND PROTECTED? WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL HARMS? HOW IS THE CONSENT PROCESS MANAGED TO ENSURE THAT THE PARTICIPANTS UNDERSTANDS THE CHOICE? AND AT THE FACT THAT EACH CONSENT IS DIFFERENT MAKES THEIR WORK REALLY HARD. SO THE THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE TO MAKE THIS EASIER IS FIRST OF ALL, TO ADOPT STANDARDIZED CONSENT LANGUAGE THAT MAKES IT EASIER TO EVALUATE A STUDY AND DETERMINE THE DATA SHARING TERMS IN AN NON-AMBIGUOUS WAY. AND ADD A MACHINERY TO BOTH CONSENT ONTOLOGY WHERE YOU COULD HAVE A MACHINE ALGORITHM WHICH MATCHES UP THE INTENDED USE OF A DATA SET TO THE PATIENT CONSENT. AND THE ANALOGY I’D LIKE TO DRAW HERE IS OPEN SOURCE LICENSES. IF WE GO BACK 10 YEARS OR 15 YEARS, THERE WAS A PROLIFERATION OF POPE LICENSES AND GROUPS CLAIMING THAT THEY WERE CLAIMING OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE BUT EACH LICENSE WAS DIFFERENT AND HAD TO BE EXAMINED INDIVIDUALLY. THEN THE CREATIVE COMMONS CAME ALONG AND THEY STANDARDIZED OPEN SOURCE LICENSES AND GROUPED THEM INTO A WELL UNDERSTOOD SERIES OF TIERS. AND THAT HAS GREATLY CLEANED UP THE ABILITY TO TAKE OPEN SOURCE TOOLS AND COMBINE THEM AND CREATE THEIR WORKS. SO THERE IS ALREADY A WELL ESTABLISHED EFFORT SPEARHEADED BY A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL I.R.B.’S AS WELL AS BY INTERNATIONAL CONSORTIUM TO CREATE STANDARDIZE PATIENT DISCONNECTED TEMPLATES. HERE ARE TWO EXAMPLES ONE IS FROM OCREB. THE OTHER IS FROM THE GLOBAL ALLIANCE FOR GENOMES AND HEALTH. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, THEY ARE TEMPLATES WHICH I’LL GIVE YOU A MULTIPLE CHOICE. YOU CHOOSE CLAUSE ONE OR CLAUSE TWO OR CLAUSE THREE AND THEY PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON WHICH ONES TO USE. OK. SO WE’LL GET -- AND THESE IN LARGE PART CAN BE SUPPLEMENTED BY THE DATA -- BY THE ONTOLOGY OF DATA USAGE WHICH I WILL TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT LATER IN THIS TALK. OK. SO ONCE THE STUDY HAS STARTED AND YOU’RE COLLECTING DATA, YOU NEED TO SHARE IT. AND WHERE DO YOU SHARE IT TO? WELL, THERE ARE A SERIES OF ARCHIVES THAT WE’RE ALL VERY AWARE OF, SUCH AS THE N.C.B.I. AND E.G.A. AND THE ELIXIR ARCHIVES WHERE PEOPLE CAN STORE DATA. HOWEVER, AS WE’RE ALL VERY AWARE, THE VOLUME OF THESE DATA HAVE REALLY MADE IT IMPRACTICAL AND FINANCIALLY INFEASIBLE TO DOWNLOAD THE DATA SETS TO DO SECONDARY RESEARCH. NOWADAYS, THE DATA ARE BEING COPIED AND MIRRORED INTO CLOUDS OF VARIOUS SORTS. AND THE PROBLEM IS THERE’S NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL CLOUD. EVERYBODY HAS THEIR FAVORITE CLOUD. EACH ONE OFFERS DIFFERENT ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES. AND THE DATA SETS END UP BEING SCATTERED AMONG MULTIPLE CLOUDS. AND SOMETIMES IN FACT, THEY ARE MIRRORED THE SAME DATA SET IS MIRRORED BETWEEN TWO CLOUDS. AND HOW DO YOU GET AT THAT DATA? SO LET’S SAY THIS IS YOUR FAVORITE CLOUD. MAYBE YOU’RE LUCKY AND YOU HAVE -- AND ONE OF THE DATA SETS IS ALREADY IN THE CLOUDS. SO YOU CAN JUST ACCESS IT THERE. BUT MAYBE YOU WANT TO COMBINE IT WITH THIS DATA SET WHICH IS NOT THERE. THERE NEEDS TO BE A TRANSPARENT WAY OF BRINGING IT INTO THAT CLOUD SO THAT YOU CAN COMBINE THE DATA SETS TO DO YOUR ANALYSIS. SO, ONE OF THE INNOVATIONS THAT I’D LIKE TO PLUG HERE IS A GLOBAL ALLIANCE FOR GENOMICS AND HEALTH SERVICE CALLED THE DATA REPOSITORY SERVICE. AND THIS IS A SERVICE, A RECENTLY PUBLISHED STANDARD WHICH ASSIGNS UNIQUE UNAMBIGUOUS I.D.’S TO DATA SETS SUCH THAT THEY CAN BE PLACED INTO A CLOUD AND YOU CAN REQUEST THEM -- YOU CAN FIND THEM, REQUEST THEM AND TRANSFER THEM INTO YOUR CLOUD IN A WELL DEFINED WAY. IT CONSISTS OF A U.R.I. SCHEME FOR DESCRIBING OWE DATA SET AND THERE ARE TWO VERSIONS OF THIS SCHEME. ONE CONTAINS THE HOST NAME OF WHERE THE DATA SET IS, PLUS A UNIQUE I.D. FOR THE DATA SET. AND THE OTHER IS A HOST NAME INDEPENDENT VERSION, WHERE THERE IS -- WHERE YOU HAVE TO PASS THIS U.R.I. TO A RESOLVER SERVICE AND THAT RETURNS THE HOST U.R.I.’S YOU CAN DOWNLOAD FROM. AND THERE’S A WHOLE A.P.I. THAT GOES ALONG WITH THIS TO CONTROL AUTHORIZATION, TO GET CHECK SUMS AND META DATA FROM THE OBJECTS AND TO REGISTER AND RESOLVE U.R.I.’S. THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN IMPLEMENTED AT MULTIPLE SITES. AND IF YOU ARE PUTTING TOGETHER A DATA REPOSITORY OF YOUR OWN, I ENCOURAGE YOU TO IMPLEMENT THIS A.P.I. TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOUR USERS TO IDENTIFY THESE DATA SETS AND AMBIGUOUSLY. NOW, ALONG WITH AN I.D., YOU NEED A SEARCH AND RETRIEVAL SYSTEM. YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE -- YOU’D LIKE AS A USER OF THIS DATA, I’D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO ASK WHAT DATA SETS HAVE DONE FOR THES AND ARE MADE AVAILABLE FOR CANCER-RELATED RESEARCH? I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GO TO A SERVER. POSE THIS QUESTION, AND HAVE IT CHECKED. FIND THE DATA SETS ARE SATISFYING THEIR REQUIREMENT AND THEN SEND ME A DATA SET MANIFEST THAT CONTAINS ALL THESE D.R.S. I.D.’S AND THEN I CAN GO TO THE CLOUD OF MY CHOICE AND PULL THEM INTO THE CLOUD SO I CAN DO THE ANALYSIS. SO THERE IS A GLOBAL ALLIANCE WORKING GROUP THAT’S WORKING ON DISCOVERY. SO FAR, IT’S PUBLISHED AN A.P.I. CALLED A BEACON SYSTEM WHICH ALLOWS FOR VERY SIMPLE QUERIES SUCH AS DOES YOUR DATA SET HAVE ANY DONORS THAT HAVE A BRACKETA 1 MUTATION AND IF THE ANSWER IS IS YES, IT WILL GIVE YOU E-MAIL TO ACCESS THAT DATA SET. THAT ISN’T WHAT WE WANT BUT IT IS THE FIRST STEP. AND THE SECOND STEP OF DOING THESE SEARCHES T STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS. THERE’S NO STABLE A.P.I. THAT I CAN RECOMMEND THAT YOU USE. HOWEVER, IN THE INTERIM, THERE IS A VERY MATURE PIECE OF DATA THAT WAS DEVELOPED MY COLLEAGUES, VINCENT AND CRISTINA AT OICR CALLED OVERTURE, WHICH DOES PROVIDE VEG TRADITION, DATA TRANSFER, META DATA MANAGEMENT AND SEARCH AND RETRIEVAL SERVICES. SO WHAT IT CONSISTS OF IS MULTIPLE PARTS. SO LET’S SAY YOU’RE A DATA PROVIDER AND YOU HAVE A PATIENT DATA SET AND YOU HAVE META DATA INCLUDING CLINICAL DATA AND GEE NOMIC DATA -- GENOMIC DATA. AND SO OVERTURE PROVIDES A SERVICE CALLED SONG WHICH TRACKS META DATA. YOU CAN REGISTER THE DATA IN SONG AND THEN USING ANOTHER PIECE OF SOFTWARE CALLED SCORE, TRANSFER THE UNDERLYING GENOMIC MOLECULAR DATA INTO A SERIES OF CLOUDS, PROVIDES A VERY FAST AND RELIABLE DATA TRANSFER SERVICE AND SONG WILL TRACK WHERE THESE DATA SETS ARE SO THAT WHEN YOU DEPOSIT IT INTO A CLOUD, SONG WILL KNOW WHEN YOU MIRROR IT AND FROM ONE CLOUD TO ANOTHER OR MOVE IT FROM ONE CLOUD OR ANOTHER, SONG WILL TRACK WHERE THE DATA SET CURRENTLY IS. AND SONG WILL PROVIDE A SEARCH SERVICE WHICH CAN BE USED -- WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO CREATE COMPELLING INTERACTIVE SEARCH AND RETRIEVAL PORTALS. AND THE FINAL COMPONENT OF OVERTURE IS A SYSTEM CALLED EGO, WHICH MANAGES AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION USING A VARIETY OF WELL-KNOWN USER I.D. METHODS INCLUDING GOOGLE I.D.’S, FACEBOOK I.D.’S AND GITHUB I.D.’S AS WELL AS OTHERS. IT’S SENSIBLE. THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED AT MULTIPLE SITES, HOLDING TEN’S OF THOUSANDS OF DORIAN DATA SETS, -- DONOR DATA SETS WHICH TRACKS 14,000 DONORS WITH THEIR CLINICAL AND GENOMIC DATA WHO HAVE PEDIATRIC CANCER AND IT ALLOWS FOR SEARCHING AND VISUALIZATION AND IT ALLOWS YOU TO CREATE VIRTUAL COHORTS BY ASKING I WANT CHILDREN WHO HAVE -- FIND ME ALL CHILDREN WHO HAVE A LIMB ABNORMALITIES AND WHO HAVE A GERM LINE MUTATION IN GENE AND YOU CAN CREATE A COHORT TO DO FURTHER STUDIES WITH. IT IS USED BY THE INTERNATIONAL CANCER GENOME DATA PORTAL THAT HAS 80,000 MUTATION AND IT IS A CLOUD CALLED THE COLLAB STORY GENOMIC RUN BY A LAB IN TOIR. IT’S USED -- IT UNDERLINES THE DATA PORTAL FOR THE GENOMIC DATA COMMONS AT THE N.C.I. 30,000 PATIENTS AND IT IS ALSO USED IN THE HUMAN CANCER MODELS INITIATIVE, WHICH IS A REPOSITORY OF CANCER MODELS. AND IT PROVIDES A SHOPPING EXPERIENCE, KIND OF MODELED AFTER THE AFTER BEST BUY AND AMAZON. JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE FLEXIBILITY OF OVERTURE AND THE ARRANGER, THIS IS WHAT THE KIDS FIRST SITE LOOKS LIKE. IT HAS AN EXPANDING SERIES OF FILTERS THAT ALLOW YOU TO CHECK OFF WHAT YOU’RE LOOKING FOR. IT’S SIMILAR TO SHOPPING FOR PRINTERS AT BEST BUY. THAT’S THE BEST ANALOGY. IT DID GENERATE -- THEN GENERATES A LIST OF DATA SETS AND DONORS THAT MATCH THE CRISIS AND THEN YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THEM, EXPORT THEM OR YOU CAN HIT THIS BUTTON WHICH BRINGS YOU INTO THE ANALYSIS CLOUD AND IMPORTS THE DATA AND ALLOWS YOU TO PERFORM ANALYSIS ON AND THEN YOU CAN DO ALL THESE THINGS FROM A SCRIPT THAT YOU’VE WRITTEN WITHIN THE CLOUD. HERE’S THE SAME SOFTWARE, BUT IT’S BEEN REBRANDED FOR USE IN THE HUMAN CANCER MODELS INITIATIVE. HERE IT’S DEMONSTRATING THERE’S INTERSIVE VISUALIZATION SHOWING YOU THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE DATA SETS YOU’VE IDENTIFIED. AND THERE’S ALSO A VISUAL QUERY SYSTEM THAT YOU CAN EDIT OR COPY OR SHARE OR IMPORT INTO YOUR SCRIPTS, WHICH WILL CAPTURE THE FILTERS THAT YOU APPLIED INTERACTIVELY. OK, SO THE LAST TOPIC I’M GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS GETTING DATA ACCESS FOR RESEARCH USE. AND THE PROBLEM IS THIS, THAT EVERY HUMAN DATA SET HAS A DATA ACCESS COMMITTEE ASSOCIATED WITH IT, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVIEWING APPLICATIONS TO ACCESS DOWNLOAD AND USE THE DATA. THE WAY THESE WORKED, IN CASE YOU’VE NOT WORKED WITH THESE PROFESSIONAL, IS YOU WRITE UP A PROPOSAL SAYING WHAT YOU’RE GOING USE THE DATA FOR. YOU COMPARE IT AGAINST THE DATA SETS USE STATEMENT, AND THE D.A.C. REVIEWS WHAT THE RESTRICTIONS ON THE DATA ARE, WHAT YOU’RE PROPOSING TO DO, AND TRY TO DECIDE IF YOU’RE ALLOWED TO DO WHAT YOU’RE ASKING FOR. IT’S REALLY CHALLENGING FOR THE D.A.C., AND IT’S FRUSTRATING FOR RESEARCHERS, AND IT MAY TAKES MONTHS FOR AN APPROVAL TO BE REVIEWED. AND IT’S PARTICULARLY PRISON MARKET WHEN THE PROPOSE -- PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC WHEN MULTIITY DATA SETS HAVE MULTIPLE STATEMENTS. THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT DATA USE RESTRICTIONS ARE, AGAIN, DONE AD HOC AS FREE TEXT. HERE’S THE FRONT PAGE OF A REPOSITORY CIRCA 2015. IT’S IMPROVED SINCE THEN, BUT NOT ALL THAT MUCH. THIS FIRST ONE IS ALLOWED FOR GENERAL RESEARCH USE. WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO WITH THE CAT, AS LONG AS IT’S IN THE INTEREST OF SCIENCE, YOU’RE ALLOWED TO DO IT. THIS SOMEONE MORE RESTRICTIVE. IT’S RESTRICTED TO RESEARCH AND AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER. THIS WAS FOR DETERMINANTS OF CANCER THIS. ONE IS ONLY TO BE USED FOR BIPOLAR DISEASE RESEARCH, AND THIS ONE IS FOR SOFTWARE AND ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT, BUT NOT FOR BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH. NOW, IMAGINE IF YOU’RE A RESEARCHER AND YOU WANT TO COMBINE MULTIPLE DATA SETS. HOW DO YOU DOUBLE IT? IF YOU’RE A D.A.C., HOW DO YOU FIGURE OUT WHETHER THE PROPOSED USE MEETS WHAT WAS IN THE CONSENT? THIS HAS THROPET OUR RESCUE AND ITS WORKING GROUP HAS DEVELOPED SOMETHING CALLED THE DATA USE ONTOLOGY, WHICH CAN BE APPLIED BOTH TO PATIENT CONSENT AND TO DATA USAGE AGREEMENTS AND ACCESS REQUESTS. AND&THEY DO THIS BY CREATING A VERY DETAILED ONTOLOGY OF WHAT THE DATA IS TO BE USED FOR, WHO CAN USE IT, AND HOW IT CAN BE USED. BOTH FOR -- AND THERE’S ONE ONTOLOGY ON THE DATA ACCESSIBILITY, AND ANOTHER ONE FOR DATA REQUESTS. AND THEN A MATCHING ALGORITHM CAN INTERCEDE AND INDICATE WHETHER THE MACHINE-READABLE PROPOSAL FOR THE USE OF THE DATA MATCHES THE MACHINE READABLE DATA USE RESTRICTIONS. HERE’S AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THAT WORKS. IT’S OPEN SOURCE BIOONTOLOGY FORMAT. WE HAVE STUDIES A TO G, AND EACH ONE HAS A SERIES OF RESTRICTIONS THIS. ONE IS FOR HEALTH MEDICAL AND BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH. THIS ONE IS GENERAL RESEARCH USE. THESE ONES ARE DISEASE-SPECIFIC RESEARCH. THAT ONE IS FOR DIABETES. SO RESEARCH COMES ALONG AND SAYS I’D LIKE TO STUDY MELANOMA. NOW, THE MATCHING ALGORITHM SAYS OK, HERE IS THE ONTOLOGY TERM FOR MELANOMA, DISEASE-SPECIFIC RESEARCH TEMPLE IT’S A CHILD OF CANCER, SO HE CAN USE THE MELANOMA SET. HE CAN USE THE CANCER DATA SETS. HE CAN USE THE HEALTH BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH SET. BUT HE CANNOT USE SOMETHING THAT ISN’T APPARENT, A DIABETES DATA SET, AND HE CAN’T USE SOMETHING THAT’S MORE SPECIFIC, SUCH AS THE MELANOMA DATA SET. SO THIS HAS NOW BEEN -- THE ONTOLOGY HAS NOW BEEN PUBLISHED. THERE’S AN A.P.I. FOR THE ALGORITHMS, AND EARLY ALGORITHMS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED, AND MATCHING ONES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED BY THE INSTITUTE AND OTHER GROUPS AND WILL BE COMING SOON TO A GIVE T HUB SITE NEAR YOU. ED THE LAST IDEA I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THE IDEA OF A PASSPORT . AND THE IDEA HERE IS THAT INSTEAD OF APPROVING INDIVIDUAL PROJECT ACCESS REQUESTS, WHICH IS TIME CONSUMING, WE CREATE A CLASS OF TRUSTED RESEARCHERS WHO HAVE TAKEN, WHO ARE IDENTIFIED, WHO HAVE TAKEN ETHICS TRAINING, AND WHOSE INSTITUTIONS CERTIFY THEY KNOW HOW TO USE DATA RESPONSIBLY. AND THESE RESEARCHERS WOULD BE ISSUED PASSPORT, A THING CALLED A PASSPORT, WHICH IS A TOKEN, WHICH GIVES THEM ACCESS TO DATA SETS. AND THEN THERE ARE INSTITUTIONS AND VARIOUS PROXIES FOR THE INSTITUTIONS CAN ADD VISAS TO THEIR PASSPORT THAT WILL GIVE THEM ACCESS TO CERTAIN REGISTERED ACCESS DATA SETS THAT ARE, FOR EXAMPLE, INTENDED FOR GENERAL RESEARCH USE. AND THEN INSTEAD OF GOING THROUGH A LONG REVIEW PROCESS, A RESEARCHER WANTS ACCESS TO A DATA SET, SIMPLY GOES IN AND SAYS HERE’S MY PASS PORKTS I’VE BEEN TRARNINGEDE I’M A RESPONSIBLE RESEARCHER, THE D.A.C. ADDS THIS TO THE TOKEN, AND THEN THEN GO TIE CLOUD AND GET ACCESS TO THE DATA, GREATLY SIMPLIFYING THIS ENTIRE PROCESS. AND FINALLY MAKING IT AVAILABLE, MAKING IT EASY TO COMBINE MULTIPLE DATA SETS. THIS IS A CONCEPT I STRONGLY SUPPORT. SO, TO SUMMARIZE, REGIONAL I.R.B.’S WILL ACCESS RATE THE APPROVAL AND MAKE IT EASIER TO GET STUDIES STARTED. MODULAR CONSENT FORMS AND USE OF THE DATA USE ONTOLOGY MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO COMBINE DATA SETS FOR RESEARCH AND TAKE OUT THE GUESS WORK AND LENGTHY REVIEW PROCESS. THE DATAS ARE PASSER TO SERVICE ENVABLES THE AMBIGUOUS IDENTIFICATION AND RETRIEVAL DATA SETS STORED AROUND CLOUDS. THE OVERTURE SYSTEM FOR THE TIME BEING PROVIDES MATURE DATA AND INTERACTIVE SEARCH FOR CLOUD-BASED DATA SETS. AND FINALLY, THE PASSPORT SERVICE REMOVES BARE DWRORSE USING REGISTERED ACCESS DATA SETS ONCE PEOPLE START BUYING INTO IT. LET’S ALL GET TOGETHER AND FLATTEN THE CURVE FOR DATA SHARING. IF YOU ARE A STUDY DESIGNER, YOU SHOULD BE ADVOCATING FOR CENTRAL I.R.B.’S WITH YOUR INSTITUTION AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. YOU SHOULD BE -- YOU SHOULD BE USING THE DUO IN YOUR CONSENTS AND USE THE TEMPLATES WHEN DESIGNING CONSENT FORMS. YOU SHOULD REALLY NIGHT AS ARE PASSER TO THAT SUPPORT THE D.R.S. SCHEME OR ARE PLANNING TO DO SO. AND FINALLY, IF YOU ARE CREATING A PORTAL, YOU’RE ENCOURAGED TO LOOK AT OVERTURE, KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE SEARCH SPACE, AND ADVOCATE WITH YOUR INSTITUTION AND FUNDERS FOR ACCEPTING THE REGISTERED ACCESS PASSPORT MODEL. JUST WANT TO CLOSE BY PROVIDING CREDIT. HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE INVOLVED WHY THESE. THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE WORKING GROUP LEADERS. I DO WANT TO MAKE A CALL OUT TO SETH AT FORBES WILD FOODS WHO MAKES REALLY GREAT MAPLE SIRUP, AND TO ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE GLOBAL ALLIANCE AND THE OVERTURE TEAMS WHO HAVE DEVOTED AND VOLUNTEERED THEIR TIME TO MAKING THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE. SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL. I’M GOING TO STOP SHARING AND SAY HELLO TO EVERYBODY.  THANKS, LINCOLN. THAT WAS VERY INTERESTING AND TIMELY. AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS. IF YOU WANT TO OPEN YOUR Q&A PANEL, YOU CAN SEE THEM. BUT I’M GOING READ OUT THE MOST POPULAR ONES UNTIL WE RUN OUT OF TIME. SO ONE QUESTION WAS, DO YOU THINK THAT THE CURRENT COVID-19 SITUATION IS CHANGING THE WAY ETHICS BOARDS ARE GOING TO REVIEW AND APPROVE SUCH PROJECTS IN THE FUTURE?  WELL, I THINK -- OK, I THINK THERE’S BEEN -- CERTAINLY DURING THE EMERGENCY PERIOD, THERE’S BEEN A GREAT ACCELERATION OF APPROVAL. IN SOME CASES, IT APPEARS THAT THE PROCESS HAS BEEN SHORT CIRCUITED AND THAT PORTALS AND PROJECTS ARE GOING UP WITHOUT THAT APPROVAL. I THINK THAT’S A MISTAKE. AND THAT INSTEAD THERE SHOULD BE WORK TO BRING THE COMMITTEES INTO THE PROCESS AND JUST SPEED UP HOW THEY’RE ABLE TO DO SO. PROVIDING FULL-TIME FUND STAFF, OF COURSE, WOULD BE ONE WAY OF MAKING I.R.B. REVIEW GO A LOT FASTER. RIGHT NOW, I THINK THE BIG BOTTLE NECK IS THAT THEY ONLY MEET ONCE A MONTH, SOMETHING LIKE SITTING ON THE ADMISSIONS COMMITTEE FOR YOUR UNIVERSITY. IT’S NOT REALLY NOT ACCEPTABLE IN A TIME OF RAPIDLY EVOLVING PROBLEM.  THANKS. SWUNLS SOMEONE ELSE ASKED IF YOU COULD MAKE YOUR SLIDES AVAILABLE.  ABSOLUTELY.  WE CAN DO THAT, OK. HOW ARE PATIENT ATTITUDES TOWARDS TRIALS DIFFERENT IN CANADA VERSUS THE UNITED STATES, WHERE OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS ALMOST ENTIRELY PROFIT-DRIVEN, EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS CAN COST THOUSANDS?  YEAH, I’M NOT AN EXPERT ON THIS. ANECDOTALLY, THERE’S MUCH MORE -- SEEMS TO BE MUCH MORE CONCERN IN THE UNITED STATES ABOUT PATIENTS WHO ARE SUSPICIOUS OF THEIR DATA BEING USED FOR PROFIT AND THEIR SAMPLES BEING USED FOR PROFIT, AND THAT EMERGES AS -- THAT EMERGES AS A CONCERN. YOU DON’T SEE THAT MUCH IN CANADA. NOT REALLY THE RIGHT PERSON TO ADDRESS THAT.  THAT LEADS WELL INTO THE NEXT QUESTION, WHICH IS DURING PUBLIC HEALTH CRISES, IT SEEMS LIKE FOR THE GOOD OF THE COMMUNITY, PRIVATE HEALTH DATA PROTECTIONS SHOULD BE SUSPENDED. HOW DO YOU BALANCE THAT?  I DO NOT. I BELIEVE THAT PORTIONS CAN BE SUSPENDED, BUT I BELIEVE A WHOLESALE SUSPENSION WOULD BE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE. AND THAT, YOU KNOW, THERE SHOULD BE TRANSPARENCY IN WHERE AN OUTBREAK IS OCCURRING, HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED, WHAT ARE THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THAT GROUP. I DON’T THINK THAT INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE SHOULD BE -- SHOULD EVER BE IDENTIFIED. I’M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THINGS THAT WERE DONE IN SOUTH KOREA, FOR EXAMPLE, WHERE PEOPLE HAD SELL PHONE APPS THAT THEY HAVE TO SHOW, TO SHOW WHETHER THEY’RE COVID STATUS. I DON’T THINK THAT’S NECESSARY FOR CONTROL. BUT A WHOLESALE SUSPENSION I THINK IS A TERRIBLE IDEA AND WILL ULTIMATELY LOWER THE PUBLIC TRUST IN MEDICAL -- IN MEDICAL RESEARCH. YOU SHOULD NOT DO THAT.  GREAT, THANKS. NEXT QUESTION IS, IS THE G.A. WORKING ON DATA USE LANGUAGE?  YEAH, THEY STARTED OUT BY CREATING A SERIES OF TEMPLATES WITH PARAGRAPHS THAT YOU COULD CHOOSE FROM IN A CHINESE MENU FASHION TO CREATE A CONSENT FORM MADE OF STANDARDIZED DATA ELEMENTS. THAT’S STILL THERE, BUT IT’S LARGELY BEEN SUPERSEDE BY THE DATA USE ONTOLOGY. AND I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS THIS MORNING. I REALIZED THAT I DON’T THINK THAT THERE’S ANYBODY WHO’S WORKING ON AN APPLICATION THAT WILL TAKE A DATA USE ONTOLOGY DESCRIPTION OF THE RESTRICTIONS AND TURN IT INTO A HUMAN-READABLE CONSENT AND VICE VERSA. SO IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO WORK ON THAT, OR IF YOU KNOW THAT SOMEBODY IS WORKING ON, IT IT’S NOT NEEDED, PLEASE SHARE THAT. SHARE IT ON THE CHAT.  GREAT, YEAH, THANKS. IS THERE ANY MANUAL REVIEW OR STANDARDIZATION OF MET ADATA ADDED TO SONG. IT GETS VERY COMPLICATED WHEN PEOPLE PUT IT IN ONE OF FOUR TO FIVE DIFFERENT FIELDS. IS THIS NEEDED SOMEHOW?  GREAT QUESTION. SONG USES THE SCHEMA TO DESCRIBE ITS SCHEMAS. IT HAS EXTENSIVE VALIDATION, BOTH OF THE SCHEMA ITSELF AND OF THE DATA THAT’S COMING IN, AS WELL AS THE ABILITY TO ADD ADDITIONAL RULES TO THE DATA SET. SO IT REALLY IS DESIGNED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SUBMITTED DATA IS COMPLETE AND CONSISTENTLY USED. I’M SURE THERE ARE WAYS TO GET AROUND IT. BUT IT IS MUCH BETTER THAN, SAY, A SPREADSHEET WITH HUMAN READABLE FIELDS.  OK, I THINK WE HAVE TIME FOR ONE MORE QUESTION BEFORE THE BREAK. WILL OVERTURE SUPPORT LOCAL OBJECT DATA STORE, FOR EXAMPLE, OPEN STACK, SWIFT, OR RATE?  IT DOES ALREADY. OR IT SUPPORTS STORAGE IN A VARIETY OF STORAGE SYSTEMS, AND THEY’RE AMONG THE FIRST. AND IT ACTUALLY -- IT USES ELASTIC SEARCH FOR ITS INDEXING AND SEARCH. BY DEFAULT IT SUPPORTS OTHER SEARCH SYSTEMS AS WELL.  THANKS SO MUCH, LINCOLN. WE ARE OUT OF TIME, BUT THANKS AGAIN FOR SUCH AN INTERESTING AND TIMELY TALK, AND I KNOW THE WHOLE AUDIENCE IS JOINING ME IN VIRTUAL APPLAUSE FOR YOU.  MY PLEASURE, AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE HONOR, INVITING ME AGAIN TO SPEAK.  THANKS SO MUCH. AND EVERYONE, WE WILL NOW HAVE A 15-MINUTE BREAK. WHEN I END THE PRESENT MODE, EVERYONE WILL FIND THEMSELVES BACK AT THEIR TABLE. FEEL FREE CHAT AND MINGLE, AND THEN THE GALAXY SESSIONS WILL START IN 15 MINUTES. SO YOU WILL REMEMBER TO USE THE GREEN AND BLUE BUTTONS TO GET TO THOSE OTHER BUILDINGS. THERE WON’T BE ANYTHING HAPPENING IN THIS MAIN BUILDING, ALTHOUGH, OF COURSE, YOU CAN STAY AND CHAT LIKE YOU WOULD IN A LOBBY AT A REAL CONFERENCE. THANKS AGAIN. AND EVERYONE, WE HOPE YOU ENJOY THE REST OF THE CONFERENCE.
