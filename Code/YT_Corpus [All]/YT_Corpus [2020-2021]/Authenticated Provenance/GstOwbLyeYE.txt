 [Music] [Music] welcome to the blockchain technology and applications course I'm Professor Sandeep Shukla from IIT Kanpur and I'll be teaching this course so this course the material on blockchain today is quite commonly available at various you know universities and various conference lectures and so on so I must acknowledge different colleagues from various universities whose lectures and whose material and books I have used to prepare the material for this course so what is a blockchain if you think generally a blockchain is a linked list so what is a linked list all of you know that a linked list is a set of blocks which are connected to each other by some kind of a link in case of a data structure linked list you have the nodes and nodes are connected by pointers and pointers are basically memory addresses but in case of a blockchain the blockchain is a distributed data structure which is replicated at various nodes or various computers and therefore the linking is not based on memory addresses so we have a different notion of linking between nodes and each of these nodes are called blocks so therefore you can imagine a blockchain as a series of blocks and each block is connected to its previous block by some kind of a link so and it is replicated all over because replication gives you a number of different advantages like if one of the replicas gets corrupted the other replicas are there to make sure that the integrity of the information contained in the in the data structure is maintained and also replication gives you some kind of guarantee of integrity of data and it is distributed in the sense that the the different computers involved in the blockchain platform actually are running distributed algorithms in order to maintain the data consistency and integrity and the consistency of the data is maintained by a process called consensus the consensus means that everybody agrees that the data that goes into the data structure is what they agree to put there and the linking as I said before traditional linked lists the linking is through memory addresses but in this case we cannot use memory addresses for linking so there is a cryptographic technique called hashing so we actually use something called a hash linking and the integrity of the data is maintained because of cryptographic techniques and consensus and replication therefore blockchain is a data structure that is maintained distributed ly and that is replicated and main purpose of blockchain is to maintain the integrity of the data and what is the integrity integrity means that the data once it has been agreed by all the relevant parties to put in the data structure it has not been tampered with it nobody has come and changed the data and and claimed that this is the data that was 410 that is made virtually impossible in a blockchain and that's the main property of the blockchain that it maintains the integrity of the data and as we will see that most of the applications where blockchain is used beat cryptocurrency or beat some other application the integrity of the data is the main thing in blockchain so what is blockchain used for so first of all you know many times we keep logs of events right so when somebody accesses your computer the computer gives a log of the user names and and how they authenticated themselves microsoft windows gives event logs every event that happens like you open a new program on your machine or something crashes or any any kind of event or you know it you can get connected to the Internet all these events are kept in event logs so logs are very important when you do banking transaction bank keeps logs of when you interacted with its banking servers and what you did what transactions you made all this are logged the main problem with keeping logs without any notion of protection of the integrity is that somebody can tamper with the logs and somebody can delete some of the accesses and therefore later on when you check the log you would know some part of its history so therefore the blockchain is designed in such a way so that it's an immutable ledger of events which means it's a log that cannot be changed by a malicious party or by mistake and therefore all the data that you put in there could be event logs it could be transactions it could be various kinds of accesses and and modifications you do some other thing like a data or you do a property transaction all these things logs are has to be kept in an immutable made ledger and that's what blockchain provides so it's in and the tampering of this data is made virtually impossible so we don't say it's at impossible to tamper as you will see as we learn more that there if you have a very high computational power which is almost impossible for individuals to gather but if you can gather that kind of computation power you can actually subvert and this all the protection and change but since it is virtually impossible we would say that this is a temper resistant log and therefore with having these properties we basically use blockchain as a platform to create and transact cryptocurrency so cryptocurrency as we'll see Bitcoin ethereum these are cryptocurrencies and we'll see that one of the first application of blockchain was Bitcoin so the whole idea of creating currency that whose transactions whose creation whose use everything has to be put in a tamper-proof log and without a trusted third but here without a central agency which keeps track of this logs and it will be clearer as we go into the course and also you know many people confuse or conflate the idea of Bitcoin and blockchain and as we'll see through the course that if cryptocurrency is just a part of the story and there are any number of other applications in which we need to keep tamper proof for temporal resistant logs and their blockchain is a very good you know platform to use so why do we need a course on blockchain right so so it seems like you know if you look at the news and if you read mostly you know technology news you will see a lot of news on on what's happening in Bitcoin its prices going up and down various kind of other issues that come up sometimes there are cyber attacks on crypto currencies or sometimes people loose cryptocurrency for various reasons or cryptocurrencies are being used for illegal activities aetherium is another such cryptocurrency now you will also hear a lot of news like for example you will hear that United Emirates is fully going on with blockchain for their most of the governance applications governance means that you know all kinds of things like property registration and you know car licensing or you know license and driver licensing all kinds of things they are doing on blockchain and many other countries are doing the same thing same thing you will hear a lot about supply chain management on blockchain or you will hear energy management especially in case of micro grids and renewable energy you will hear a lot about that patience of blockchain or or you know electric vehicle charging stations and and and paying for the charge you know electric charging and all that on a blockchain like in Germany so very soon you will hear that a blockchain is for everything for Nirvana so people often say that ok so this is a new hype and a lot of hyperbole so what we will see in this course is that it is not a hype and it is a technology quite transformative technology so many people compare it with the advent of the Internet in transforming our lives and digitalization and similarly people say that or predict that blockchain is going to be as transformative in the way we digital eyes are functioning and our governance and our industrial dealings our financial markets and and so on and so forth so even if you don't care about cryptocurrency and its market volatility which is one of the biggest criticism of cryptocurrency you will see a lot of application of blockchain which has nothing to do with cryptocurrency and this course will try to teach you why that is the case and in fact I personally is a strong critic of crypto currencies like Bitcoin and and others and therefore my interest is that people learn that even if you don't care about cryptocurrency you should care about blockchain as a technology because it's a transformative technology so this course is about that so let's start with some examples where we can use blockchain so I'll first discuss some problems that you can probably solve with blockchain and I'm not going to initially talk about how we can solve it with blockchain because we haven't taught you how the blockchain works but I'll tell you what the problems are with our traditional way of digitalization and and probably hint at you know maybe blockchain might provide a solution so this example here by you know from Arvind naren's book so so this will discuss how we do banking today right so in a bank banking system we have multiple players right so we have customers ourselves we have the bank and we have the bank employees and we have a regulatory agency in case of India it is the RBI so what happens is that when you do transactions right so there are multiple ways you do transactions so let's consider two of them one is you write a check to give money to somebody or you do an internet transaction like you log into your banking server and then you authorize a transaction and it goes through what the bank does and it does automatically not necessarily through intervention of human employees is that it checks if your balance is greater than your transaction amount if it is not then it will say it is an invalid transaction it will reject the transaction if it is yes then it will transfer the transaction amount from your account to the other persons or faiis account and your account will be debited by that transaction amount now how do you know that this is done properly and correctly you check your transaction list online or you get your monthly statement and then you check that all the transactions you mend are recorded correctly now the question is who is maintaining this ledger from which this monthly statement is generated the bank does now the because of regulatory framework that we have we don't see banks doing something wrong in this case which we never almost never find that you know I made a transaction and it was it went through but now in my statement I don't see it or I don't see normally don't see that I never did a transaction and it is appearing in my in my statement this kind of things did not doesn't normally happen but it could happen how couldn't happen we if the ledger is wrong or if somebody inside the bank tampered with the ledger and put a transaction in there which was not made by you in those cases we say that it's an invalid transaction and you say that I did not authenticate and authorize this transaction or your balance was not sufficient and the transaction still went through and you don't have a overdraft account in such cases we say that the transaction is invalid and you go to the bank and in most cases the bank will be very surprised and they will not know they have to investigate and all kinds of stuff can happen in case of checks also somebody can forge your check it recently happened who one of the top medical educational institutes recently about 12 crores of money was transferred through forged checks and those checks were checked under UV light by the banking authorities and they turned out to be you know authentic checks but the Institute said that it didn't do the transaction or what if you have an extra zero is put at the end of the amount field and somehow tampered with so monthly statement will claim that you have done it but you can you say that no and another possibility somebody obviously got your password and somehow fool you into revealing your OTP or did a sim fraud to get your OTP instead of you getting them and in those cases also you wouldn't know what's happening so it's a very difficult for the argument with the bank so if you go and say that if you repudiate that I haven't made this transaction the bank may not believe it because it will think that you are you have no proof that you didn't do it so it's called non-repudiation you don't have the non reputable 'ti if you argue the amount was modified than the amount that you actually transacted then you questioning the integrity of the data that is being now presented to you and there also you if you don't have a proof of what the original amount then it really is your word against this and finally do you even tally the transactions like if you add the entire debit and credit you get your monthly statement most people don't do and and therefore we depend where we trust the bank on all these issues so the way the bank maintains its data about your transactions is not very transparent to us we trust them to do it and we trust them because they are answerable to the regulatory authority RBI and therefore we trust them but that's what is what we call by a trusted third party enforced trust and that is often a problem in in case of rogue banks and and things like that and so we are advocating here is more transparency in the way the transactions are done and transactions in records are maintained and as we'll see that the blockchain could be one of the solutions which will provide transparency and also maintain the integrity of the data and therefore provide more reason for us to trust the the banking system without a trusted third party enforcing the trustworthiness now second problem I want to talk about here is a supply chain provenance so what happened see the supply chain is that you ordered something your business and you order something from another supplier and that's a player also orders various parts from a third supplier and the third supplier orders various parts from a fourth supplier so this is what is called a supply chain and when the final product is made you as a business is making product whose quality depends on the quality of the components and other things that you have got through the supply chain and therefore if your quality has a problem maybe it is not your manufacturing problem or your construction problem but it is somewhere down the line in the supply chain and you have to attribute whose fault it is and to do that you have to have proper transparency about where all the components are coming from normally we only know the person who supplied us but that supply are also dependent on a third supplier third supplier of depending on food supply and we don't know any of that most of the time unless we go and investigate and also there are quality guarantees that are not enforced from your end at the every step between two consecutive suppliers so I'll give you a very simple example this is an example I heard from Maurice Herlihy so suppose you are restaurant and you are buying ice cream from supplier B supplier B is not manufacturing or producing ice cream but it is actually supplying from company C's factory so to your customer you are responsible for the quality of the ice cream but the ice cream every time you are getting seems to be melted so who is responsible so you can say to supplier B that you probably kept the ice cream too long in your truck or your Emperor ature has a problem in your truck or you can say supplier see you made melted ice cream when it was picked up by supplier B it was already melted and supplier B says that when it received the temperature was too high and therefore this is the problem so how do you find the truth so one possibility is that as a restaurant you can put temperature sensors on the truck of supplier B as well as and the factory of supplier C where it stores its freshly produced ice cream and then you get the sensor data from the suppliers directly through wireless network and then you keep along and you check the log you would know whether B or C had bad temperature and that's why it happened but there are certain problems and we'll talk about that will come by revisit this problem about the integrity of the data that is coming from the supplier B and supplier C even when you actually put those sensors and we'll see how maybe the block chain might be a solution a third problem here is land records so many of you watch this movie slacker Khosla right so so you buy a piece of land and somebody claimed that he owns the land and showed you some paperwork and you paid him or heard the money and land registry office you checked and land registry office said yes this land belongs to this owner so you trusted that and you went ahead and paid and then this person disappears then a third person comes and says that this land actually is a mine and if so sell is not legitimate so at this point you go back to the registry and registry says oh we made a mistake actually some data was missing and now we know that this person is right now you're you have basically have no land even though you paid somebody who is now missing so somebody might have changed the land record twice once in the name of that other guy and then name of this guy and all their logs for this change of this data has also gone missing because we are trusting the land registry authority to maintain the integrity of the land record and also if any access is made for changing any of the land records maybe the logs has to be protected also but the logs were not protected properly because it's an insider who has managed to delete relevant entries in the log so it's not clear who accessed the log also there has been a question about your other accesses so remember that there was a case where people who did they're using other authentication the deed their kyc or getting SIM card from Airtel the Airtel Bank also made an samey kyc to create an account in your name and then all their you know cooking gas subsidy was being now deposited to that bank account now this is actually saying this was shut down later on this process but we need to know who is accessing our data to the in the other database for doing ek YC so then you I you di decided that through their website you can go there and see who access to your other other information or who did eky see on your this thing but it didn't show the demographic look up properly but it showed the EQ I see logs but this logs are now maintained by you IDI now if you do if you trust you IDI then you will say ok these are the only times when somebody did a kyc on me but if you if you think that somebody is doing kyc and somebody inside the UAD i might have deleted the logs there is no way to prove or disprove that so there is a trust problem that can build up so therefore you know in this case also the tamper proof property of this logs should be somehow convincing to the customers or to the users so that they can trust that whatever they are getting as log of their ikki YC is indeed the only times when their ek YC was done so so now we have spoken about four problems one is your banking transaction logs and their tampering possibility second we talked about supply chain data and supply chain provenance and their tamper proof property third thing we talked about Land Registry and need for the integrity of that data and maintaining keeping the integrity of the logs of accessing and modifying that data fourth thing we are talking about the eky see logs maintained by you idii and in all these cases in the current traditional system we have to trust a third party over we have to trust me the authority who is maintaining the data to actually maintain the integrity of the data and that may or may not be very prudent to trust so now finally the great submission and management system in a you know in a university or in an institute where professors submit grades online and it goes to a database and that database is now you know maintained and then the student so in the login to see their grades or you know print out their rate card they actually access the database now between the time professor submits the data and when the student sees the data between that time if somebody Insider actually changes a grade then there is no way for the professor to know because professor might have 400 students in the class and unless there is an investigation when he might have written records of the thing of the data but if nobody has complained and this there is no way for the student to know unless the great change has been very drastic like somebody's supposed to get an A and got an F but otherwise there will be there will be no way to know that the data integrity has been violated and the person who did this inside might also remove the log of accessing that database and that could be a problem and therefore there is not enough transparency in which the data is maintained without you know leaking out the private information like the grades of students but there should be transparency of how the data is maintained and and some kind of proof that the integrity of the data has not been tampered with and then only the there will be full trust from the students or from the professors that this system is tamper proof when there is no wait for somebody to come in change the data from from inside or by through some cyber attack or something like that so these are the things where blockchain might come handy as a technology to solve this questions that I have raised so far so people might expect that oh so this is a course on blockchain so it's a it might be about Bitcoin and aetherium and we'd learn how to actually transact and all that stuff but that's not the case and here is why I would argue that why I don't want a course on Bitcoin or currency however if you are interested in the full dynamics of Bitcoin and and how it works and how you actually make transactions and how you can make you know micro payments and all that with Bitcoin then you can actually go to Coursera and there is a very nice course by Professor her wind or Narellan who actually from Princeton and whose course is about Bitcoin only right but our course is not on Bitcoin and the reason is that bitcoin is something that has also raised a lot of concern about cryptocurrency so one of the very early story after the Bitcoin came into existence was the history of the Silk Road Silk Road was in underground market and the underground in the sense that it was being carried out in the dark web so dark web is basically is the part of the web where people don't have direct access like we'd go to an website of a news organization or an institute or our business these are places which are accessible through the web but if they are not accessible directly by common people you have to know exact address of the location and probably very strong authentication and many times you cannot even go to them without using some anonymous anonymous browsers like tor tor browsers and there they be under people from the underground operations of drug and other things extortions and all that stuff they actually transact in Bitcoin and Silk Road was dismantled by FBI around 2013 or so but they're still a lot of business in the dark web that happens using Bitcoin because Bitcoin is almost anonymous there is no way if you ask me to send money to a particular Bitcoin address there is no way to know whose address it is even by from the law enforcement agencies and therefore it's very difficult to trace and this is the same thing that is happening today when there is a ransomware attack on ransomware attackers encrypt your entire disk by sending a malware through your fishing link or something and then they actually demand money to unencrypted or decrypt your device by and they want you to pay in Bitcoin or ethereum because of the anonymity that they can hide behind so that's one of the problem of Bitcoin so in legal activities and all run somewhere these are some of the problems but there are other problems right so one of the thing you would know that Bitcoin prices go up and down sometimes they went to close to $20,000 a Bitcoin and now I think it is about 12,000 sometimes it was 5,000 sometimes it came down to 8,000 so so if you think that investing in Bitcoin is a good idea that is not something that I would advocate if you want to invest and quickly make money in in a couple of days and you have a lot of money maybe you can invest in Bitcoin but otherwise it is a long term asset I don't think the Bitcoin is a Bitcoin is a little too risky unless you have that kind of risk appetite you probably don't want that the other thing is that the way Bitcoin works so we talked about the consensus mechanism right so we haven't we'll discuss this later in the class how the consensus works there are many ways to arrive at consensus so consensus is when all the parties agree that this transaction indeed took place and then only it goes to the ledger right so this consensus process in Bitcoin because of its anonymity and the fact that it is anybody can join the Bitcoin network so therefore we cannot tell whether people are honest so therefore the consensus mechanism has to be very very cryptographically challenging and to solve those cryptographic puzzles and we'll talk about that later in the course it requires the immense amount of rotational power and when you do that kind of computation for arriving at consensus and you actually have to arrive at many consensuses over a short period of time and therefore the amount of energy that you require to do that kind of computation is enormous and that was very harmful for the environment and we'll see that if you look at the statistics that Bitcoin mining today actually process of arriving at a consensus actually is also called a Bitcoin mining the reason why it is called mining is because anytime a consensus is arrived there would be only one winner who's selected data will be actually made permanent into the data store or in the blockchain and they get some reward so in the beginning Bitcoin was giving 50 bitcoins as reward if your data collection becomes permanent then they have date to 25 bitcoins and at this moment it is 12.5 bitcoins that you can get but this is how bitcoins are also created therefore this consensus process in Bitcoin his calls also called Bitcoin mining and this mining process is so so expensive in terms of computation and therefore in terms of power consumption that it is consuming more electricity than 159 countries including Ireland and most countries in Africa so you can think how wasteful it is to actually mined bitcoins so any other cryptocurrency that is also based on participation of public anonymously would have to have a similar kind of consensus process and therefore they will also be wasting a lot of power and that is a big concern for from the environment point of view also it becomes very expensive to buy equipments which are capable of doing such computation and therefore it get more tilted towards people who have deep pockets you and I with our regular laptops or or other machines we cannot you know have the ability to win this process of consensus so we cannot make bitcoins whereas the there are people who have invested millions of dollars in buying equipments and and and paying electricity bill and air-conditioning bill for their huge complete forms and therefore they are able to do this so this makes this entire Bitcoin ecosystem very very tilted towards those people and the other thing is that most of this Bitcoin mining companies now actually there are companies which actually can only afford such large-scale Bitcoin mining and this many of these companies are in China now what happens is that it is it is provable that if one person or one player in the Bitcoin platform has more than 51% of the computational power then he can actually completely change the data in the Bitcoin network so earlier we said that in a blockchain the data that we forced or after the consensus is the ample proof right nobody can come and change the data the reason why they cannot do that because to the amount of computation they have to do in order to tamper it is too much because they have to then undo all the computation that was done to stored that data and any other computation that was done to store data subsequent to that so this is a total amount of work computational work that somebody has to do to tamper with but if I have majority of the computing power in the entire ecosystem then I can actually completely change the entire chain chain of data all that the data I want to change and all subsequent data now think about this and if one country has most of these or majority of this companies who are doing Bitcoin mining if they want to get together and then their total computational power becomes above 51 percent then Bitcoin will have no integrity of its transactions and therefore ecosystem will fail also because of this environmental concerns and and volatility of the cryptocurrency and so on maybe the the country in which all this companies are there and they're consuming power they are polluting the environment the country might decide that they will curtail the activities of these companies and therefore there will be a another kind of problem and when this kind of news has come you will see the Bitcoin prices fall the reason is even though it may be a speculative news because because we are now dependent on all these different extraneous things which are not imagined by the originator of the Bitcoin and originator of the Bitcoin was an anonymous person who used the name Satoshi Nakamoto and in 2009 he wrote the first you know version of the Bitcoin and he launched it and he also wrote a white paper and his idea was to get rid of the tyranny of the large banks right so in 2008 there was a international financial meltdown and it turned out that the banks did a lot of things which are not properly you know correct things to do and in fact from the writing and from the original message that was in the first block of the Bitcoin blockchain it seems like he was actually trying to emancipate people from the from the hold of the banks and then they want the entire world everybody to become part of a cryptocurrency system which is not dependent on a central bank or on the banks to actually decide the you know the value of the permanent but unfortunately the way it worked out and wait wait and folded is that only a handful of companies are now doing most of the Bitcoin mining and then the all the transactions that are happening are also by only a you know only one 2% of the people who are involved in the bit an ecosystem and the same thing is happening in aetherium that 90% of the transactions are done by maybe hundred players when there are about six million players in the ecosystem so you can see that there is a huge amount of inequality that is building up in the cryptocurrency system when there are only handful of players who are doing all the activities all the transactions storing all the all the currencies and the rest of the other people are doing very little and therefore the entire dream of Satoshi Nakamoto whoever it is is not being translated to reality so that's another problem and as you know that in India the RBI has put a blanket ban on Bitcoin as a transaction medium and or any kind of cryptocurrency and there is a good reason for that and will not get into that but that is how it is so then there is another problem that this problem has been happening because of various reasons so that some common people so Bitcoin if you want to directly play into the Bitcoin ecosystem do mining do transactions you have you have to be computationally savvy right you have to know how to create a private key how to create a public key how to tell other people that this is my public key which which basically gets shortened to your wallet address and then you have to store the your private key very very securely in order to so that nobody knows your private key because once you know once they know your private key the money is no longer yours because they can use your private key to spend the money or transferred the money to another account so so this cryptography the public key private key is very important for operating in the in the Bitcoin or aetherium economy now common people businessmen they might not be computationally savvy so they have another way of investing in the Bitcoin or aetherium or any kind of cryptocurrency is by going to an exchange crypto currency exchange and say that I am giving this kind of money and give me this worth of cryptocurrency now what this company will do is give you some kind of a paper or some kind of a link that says that you now own so many bitcoins because you give me this amount of real money and then all the private key and everything will be stored at the exchange so there there is a there are two kinds of wallets like hot wallet and cold wallet and most of this keys that are not very frequently used are put into the cold wallet and and and and how to wallets are the ones that are being used very commonly now this happened in one of the exchange mount docks where there suddenly the exchange owners they said that there is a so many millions of worth of cryptocurrency has been transferred to somebody else's account and as I said that once it is transferred to an account the account number is actually a public key in a hash form and therefore no no way to know who is behind it so the police or anybody cannot really find the person whose wallet has got that money so so therefore the owner said that you know the art private keys were stolen and therefore this happened people suspected that the stealing person is they one of the exchange owners only and since the actual people who purchased bitcoins from this exchange did not keep their own keys the keys were in the in the cold wallet of this or cold vault of this exchange so therefore they have no records so then they they could not get the money and this was a huge loss for a lot of people more recently there was another case so this is the quadriga is another such exchange and in that exchange what happened is that the person who owned the exchange also had me in his cold wallet a lot of keys 145 million dollar worth of cryptocurrencies keys he had and then he died and with him the password or code for accessing that wallet you know went away and nobody there was no backup nobody else knew that code and therefore 145 million dollar worth of cryptocurrency was lost and the losers were people who actually bought them and now recently the news is that their exhuming his body to figure out if he actually made a disappearing act by killing somebody else or like so they want to check whether this person who is buried has him is really him so this is this has come to that so so this is the other issue about cryptocurrency is that if you are not take savvy and you are not doing it yourself you are dependent on this exchanges and all this happenings can happen to you and you may lose a lot of money the other thing that also happens is that there are bugs in the code of the blockchain ecosystem or in case of etherion the bug was in the smart contracts so smart contracts are programs that work on your behalf from your address from your account and do transactions and other things and so in this case there was a bug a reinsurance e bug and therefore attackers could actually make transfer from all of this smart contracts for from various people's accounts 30 million dollar worth of ether to their accounts fortunately some of the good hackers they realize this is happening so they actually also use the same bug to actually siphon off rest of the money of the rest of the accounts to their address and later on they paid it back to the rightful owners but the thirty million dollar worth of ethereum ether that was lost was lost to their hackers so these are the kind of things that are concerning about to currency so in summary I would say that let's admit that Bitcoin first brought to us the technology of blockchains so it was a very good thing that happened Satoshi Nakamoto actually he understood we how to create an ecosystem in which there is replication distributivity consensus mechanism all this technology and algorithms that already existed in the distributed system literature he actually brought them together and also brought together there are some some already existing concepts of digital cash and the idea of what we call no double spending and all that think together he brought them together and created Bitcoin so we are kind of like happy to have the technology with us but Bitcoin as such or or if you consider etherium and other cryptocurrencies we have seen in the last 10 years or so there is too much interest by investors to park their assets there and if that happens then the old idea of a currency what is a currency currency is something through which you exchange value right now if you just Park it somewhere then it is not being used as a currency it's being being used as a storage medium of value and so that is one problem so it's not being used so much as medium of value exchange the private key stealing and private keys at exchanges is putting people to enormous risk of losing large amounts of money there are vulnerabilities in the coding of the smart contracts and other parts of the code which poses risk of losing money there is also market volatility based on various news as I was mentioning and therefore there are lots of possibilities of losing money there is a lot of energy wastage we talked about that climate impact and too much concentration in one country which is also a problem and then there is regulatory risk because regulators of different countries are framing their rules for allowing or disallowing crypto currency or regulating them and also criminal activities use Bitcoin so all this together basically makes us not to focus on Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in this course even even then we'll talk quite a bit about the Bitcoin and ethereum because of learning from them the technological underpinning which is very useful and very worthy to understand so we'll talk about Bitcoin how it works how the consensus works there and and also we'll talk about aetherium and smart contracts and all that but will not focus on this application of blockchain in cryptocurrency will focus on application of blockchain for non cryptocurrency usage in this course so then coming back to blockchain now let's say blockchain technology is a digital innovation that has a potential to significantly impact trusted computing activities and therefore cyber security concerns as a whole so trusted computing is a is a concept that when you do computing and if you depend on the results of the computing and by computing we are not only mean number crunching also mean the entire ecosystem they the exchange of information over the network the storage the databases all these things are we are clubbing together as computing but when you do computing and your system depends likee governance system or your identity system or your your grade management system or your property registration system the dependent on a whole computing ecosystem so but then if you are depending on the computing ecosystem there are many different possibilities by which data you know in that ecosystem can be impacted and and tampered with and a bit while it is transit transiting through the network bead while it is in storage be it while it is being computed so therefore we have to worry about trusted computing when you can trust the computing environment to produce result keep the integrity of the result and give me transparency of how it is processing the data how it is storing the data and how it is protecting the data against various kind of attacks and that is what blockchain can give you and the attractive properties of blockchain for this purpose is that it gives you a temple proof log of data with authentication which means that the data also is signed by whoever created that data and then it is immutable or almost immutable so which means that once written it is cryptographically very computationally hard to remove that log or to tamper with the log and if you want the transparency but not reveal the private information you can do that in blockchain so it's it can you can make it privacy preserving and it provides a basis for trusted computing on top of which applications can be built so let's talk a little bit about when we say trust what we mean by trust so trust model that you assume in case of computing environment we have to consider what are the trust is kind of lip opposite of your attack model like who can attack or how threat model like what are the threats to the integrity and privacy and availability of the information so first of all you can put your trust on the hardware and say that hardware will not leak your cryptographic key but is that true and it is not necessarily true because there is something called side-channel attacks through which people have shown that they can actually get your cryptographic key while you are doing encryption or you are doing decryption they can look at the power that you are drawing from the your power you know source or they can look at the electromagnetic signature or they can look at the timing and all kinds of things by which they have shown that they can reveal your cryptographic key so unless your hardware is in a proof to that kind of manipulation your hardware may not be trustworthy so nowadays there is a lot of work on how to make a hardware trustworthy by using enclaves and and other kinds of mechanisms and even there we have people have shown there ways to subvert the protections that be hardware companies come up with you must have heard of Intel's meltdown and specter bugs that came out two years ago so so you may or may not be able to trust the hardware so in that case if you don't trust your hardware you have to make sure that you do the protection against any kind of key leaking and all that stuff at the next layer which is the operating system layer or firmware layer and there the question is now operating system is basically create processes and they have memory in which the computational results and stuff are temporarily kept and this memory is also hierarchical so which means that some of part of the memory addresses sometimes come to the caches and and all that stuff happens so therefore the question is are there ways in which people can peek into your cache or peak into your memory and then look get your private information your private key and all that stuff so that has that is another question of trust now if you you are using virtual machines then you have to know whether your hypervisor leaks information they can peek into your process memory and all that stuff and then your applications maybe also have bugs and they may be cyber attacked and wild application is using some of your data it may actually tamper with that or it may actually developers private keys and all that stuff if your application is using your private key without any protection so the question is what is your trust anchor right is it in the hardware or is it in the operating system is it in the application or you trust a manufacturer like Intel or others to actually give you a trusted platform B but in case of the applications like governance and and you know great management system or whatever the question is do you trust the bank that they are not taking our small amounts from your balance all the time there is a movie called office space that was taking only a you know fraction of a cent from every transaction and very soon they accumulated millions do you trust the land record Department to keep the integrity of the land records do you trust the UID AI officials to keep your other data access logs you know in you know integrity of that do you trust your local system administrators to not to go around your back and change your data read your data and then delete all that information from the system log if you have a patch management system in your enterprise how do you know that the patches are being made or somebody is doing an unauthorized patch to attack your system and things like that so that those are the problem that you have to worry about so so far we have spoken about the trust model and corresponding threat model which are kind of inverse of each other now let's look at some of the cases that we talked about before in detail in light of what we have discussed since then so let's first look at how one can create a digital coin and this is our winner an ins crypto coin version 1 so what you can do you can say that I am going to be your mint and I'm going to create a digital coin and then I'll give it a coin ID and then I will have a public key and private key and I will sign the coin with my private key okay so anybody who has my public key because public keys are usually known to everybody else so he can check that it is my signature and once it has my signature it is a valid coin so then so I can then give the coin to somebody else maybe we are in next of some value you know in the real world like I buy a book from him and then I give it to a friend so how do I give it to a friend the friend creates an public and private key and I give the friend I say that pay to his public key address this coin and I sign it with my private key so anybody can check whether I signed it by using my public key and I also in order to keep the history of how this coin was created and who gave it to whom I created a link to the previous information that the coin was created by me so this red link that you are seeing here is actually that link that is keeping that history along now since I have now the coin I earned it by giving you a book or something selling you a book so now I want to give it to advant who now gives me something like maybe another book so I want to give the money to her win so I say that pay to her wins public address public key and then I sign it right and I am the friend so I sign it and then I keep a link to the previous to previous link to information pieces of information so if anybody wants to check where this coin came from then he has to basically go down the links and see where the coin was created who got it first and who got it second and so on so this is where so every time I pass the coin all this information is also passed about the coins history so I win now owns the coin but if I am dishonest what I can do since this is digital so I have no problem to pass it on to multiple people so I actually give a copy to Ravi another friend for another thing that I get from him and do the same linking and all that now the question is I had only one coin now I have give it to two people now these two people will have to you know both have the same coin that is not possible right because if you have a real-world coin the you could not have given to two people since you are digital you're cutting and pasting so you can actually give it to two people and this is what is called it double spending so I have done a double spending which cannot be done in a real money monetary system because then you know if I can do double spending I can do triple spending and then the the value I got from this one coin is twice they are real value right because I got something from Arvind I got something from Ravi but I am just giving them the same thing and they also when they try to use it they will it will be a problem so this is called a double spending or since it's actually an attack call it a double spending attack so major challenge has always been in the digital currency from 80s people have been trying to solve this problem of creating digital money and this my all this people have come to this problem that how do you stop double spending and if you can do double spending you can do triple quadruple all kind of spending so we have to do something more than what we just showed you in the version 1 so version 2 is how we can make a double spending proof digital currency so what we what has been did is that saying that will create a history of all the transactions so earlier when we were giving the coin to somebody we were not giving any number to it right so we were just connecting them through this links now we say that will have various transactions and each transaction will basically spend one coin but we need to know where that coin came from from which transaction so you have to go and see the next transaction and the finally there will be a transaction when the coin was created right so this history has to be kept and this history now the data structure in which you keep the history and all that stuff is a matter of details like but the main question is who keeps track of the transaction history like who tells me that somebody is trying to do a double spending and then if I have done a double spending - given the coin - to people who decides who actually gets the money and who is the one who is not going to get the money and so which means that somebody has to tell me which one is a valid transaction which one is not valid transaction so concept of validity here would be that the coin that has been used in the transaction is a valid transaction also it's not already consumed and the total value out of this transaction should be total value in so if I am have multiple coins from multiple sources I can use that in one transaction because not everything has a value of one coin so I can get three different coins to buy a thing worth of three coins but then the total value in and value out should be the same and then it should be signed by the owners of all the consumed coins right so this is the question of validity so that history that you saw has to be of valid transactions right so so somebody has to check the validity of the transaction and somebody has to use the history to tell me whether double spending is being done so now how do you actually maintain the coins whether you make the coins immutable and all this is a detail so we will not worry about it at this point so the crucial question is who maintains a history and who validates the transactions and who tells me that the this is invalid because there is a double spending so one possible solution of course is having a trusted third party right so and if once you have trusted third party we are back to the same conventional problem that I have a third trusted third party he maintains the ledger of transactions and he checks consult the ledger every time and coin is trying to be used in a transaction to ensure that D this is a valid transaction and but the question is should we try the trusted third party the trusted third party might be a biased entity and they might actually always arbitrate in favor of some people and arbitrate against some people so it defeats the purpose of a distributed consensus mechanism and all that and that's where the blockchain based solution comes into play so trusted third party is not our preferable solution because that solution already exists in being used today but we want to remove the trusted third party and create a trust system in which we can transact trusting the system not trusting a single entity so that's see about that cryptocurrency issue now back to the supply chain story right so you have the ice cream factory you have the delivery truck and you have the restaurant and this question was that who is melting the ice cream whether it's the factory when it supplies it to the truck or the truck that is actually keeping it at a very high temperature and the ice cream is melting so let's see what solutions so the question is here is about you know supply chain integrity and when I get melted ice cream I ask questions to both of them and both of them point fingers at each other so as I said earlier that I could put an IOT on internet-of-things type of sensor in each of this places in the factory and in the in the truck and I can say that send me your temperature every second or every 30 seconds and I will keep track of your temperature where you store and I will actually decide who is responsible for this however there are multiple problem that can occur so we'd like to talk about what can go wrong first of all if you do nothing other than just make these IOT devices send information then the information is not encrypted and digitally signed then somebody can do a man-in-the-middle attack so they can actually intercept the message change it so maybe the the company B will try to do that to make Company C look bad by intercepting the temperature coming from Company C and then replace it by a higher temperature so data integrity could be a problem and other thing is that if your temperature keeps going up because cooling system failed you might fool the restaurant by doing a replay attack which means you record the whole temperatures and then you replay it and send it repeatedly to the restaurant and rest mental think that your temperatures are fine so that's a replay attack again data integrity issue then if the temperature that is coming from factory C is actually being manufactured by supplier B by replacing or jamming the signals from the factory C and pretending to be factory C and send the restaurant B bad information so there is an authenticity problem like when the data comes to I trust that this data is actually from factory C and not by sent by somebody else and then if something like this happens or not happens if factory C claims that this is what happened his temperature was fine but the temperature you are seeing is actually somebody else did an attack and and man-in-the-middle attack and send wrong temperature information and there is so the he is repudiating what information has come from his supposedly from his sensor and that repudiation non-repudiation is not a property so restaurant a is again at a loss even though he spent money putting sensors with with communication capabilities but he's not happy because he cannot decide what happened this can be solved without any blockchain issue right you can use message integrity proof by hashing or message authentication code you can use digital signature for all I or T devices and then you have the authenticity and non-repudiation you can use time stamping to top replay attacks and now factoring a can get all the data with authentication with with the privacy and with integrity everything fine right but the problem does not end here because supply chain problem has a concurrency problem because is not the only consumer from supplier B or supplier C supplier BC have other consumers similarly restaurant a has other supply chains right so it gets meat from somewhere it gets vegetables from somewhere so there are many parties involved and if you want to check supply chain provenance for all your supply chains then you have a n square problem because every party should be able to send information to everybody else whatever the sensor readings are and in the sensor could be temperature it could be about the pH level it could be about various things and therefore it's a huge amount of crisscross information and that needs to be addressed because it's not going to scale so to restaurant a may say ok I have a very good nice data center so I will keep everybody's information so you just only have to send to me and then I will give a nice interface to the information I collect and everybody else every other restaurant and every other supplier can log into it and look at the information and make themselves happy no but then why would you trust a to be the purveyor of your data what if a wants to make some other entity look bad and tamper the data so when you sue in that entity another entity looks up the data for that entity sensors you might see wrong information right so you cannot trust a single entity to do all the job because then it becomes a trusted third party again so you can use a cloud provider and so instead of a B or C or anybody the cloud provider collects all the information and most IOT vendors now is giving a solution based on this cloud-based data collection and then interface to the cloud to look at the browse the data and do analytics and the data but what if the cloud provider cannot be trusted that's a possibility right because again a trusted third party so then the question is you can use block chain because blockchain is not a trusted third party blockchain is create trust computationally by using a distributed consensus mechanism so all the information that comes to the blockchain is seen by all the players in the blockchain and all the players have to somehow agree that the information is correct and once the information put there nobody should be able to tamper with it right so blockchain is actually a framework that can be actually a very good use in this supply chain case that we just described so we'll see later that various kinds of blockchain solutions to this kind of problems not necessarily we'll take this problem because this problem is probably a too simple a problem to discuss later but you get the idea that here important part is that even with all the cryptographic measures like digital signatures and you know encryption and message authentication code you still have a scalability problem and concurrency problem that needs to be solved and the one simple solution would be to have a trusted third party to collect all the data and keep it but trusted third party is not something we want because it again gives brings us back to the old traditional mechanism where you have to somehow put your trust on a trusted third party instead if you can create a computational platform in which trust is by virtue of the computational process then it's much better solution and more fair solution so that's what we would like to do so we are at the end of our first lecture so in the first lecture what we learnt is that blockchain is about distributed record-keeping trust model varies but having a single point of trust is never good and based on the trust model you may have to use blockchain but depending on who you trust and how much you trust you have multiple different types of blockchain so we'll see permission blockchain nan permission or public blockchain and also private blockchains so these are the some of the different alternatives and based on how much you trust which party and and how much you know about the players who will be actually participating in the consensus process in the validation of the data process then you have to choose the different types of blockchain and we try to learn how those things are done or what are the different considerations that go into choosing this kind of alternatives data integrity we talked a lot about no one tampered with the data after its creation is very important and that's where blockchain comes into play and authenticated transactions and event logging is something very important if you want to know not necessarily the data itself but meta data that is the data about who accessed the data and who modified the data who added the data that kind of information and strong cryptographic applications blockchain is a strong use of cryptography and blockchain is not certainly only about cryptocurrency and in this course will not be focusing on cryptocurrency but will talk about some of the technology of Bitcoin and aetherium and all that because we need to understand the underlying technology so summary of lecture one so what did you learn the need to learn about blockchain technology and applications is what we emphasized on today because of the various applications we talked about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency are only examples of this technology but this technology is have much broader usage and much more potential trust model depends determines what kind of blockchain you are going to use or if you at all need block you will blockchain solve your problem because that's something also one has to take away from this course because many times we I get requests that can you help us to do blockchain per our application and when you actually investigate closely there are trust assumptions and their their their operating environment and you find that under their trust assumptions and everything blockchain is not required or it will be an overkill right so you have to also get we have to have the critical understanding of when blockchain can be of help and have value and also what kind of blockchain is good for that particular application basic issues that led to the creation of a Bitcoin about the not trusting the banks and and the or a trusted third party or a central authority and supply chain provenance and integrity and trust model concurrency issues that arise when there are many players and maybe in that case central data collector like a cloud may be or may be not a good solution and fault tolerant consensus is required in working of the blockchain consensus mechanism and work out the trust model issues so this is the introduction that we have gone through today in the next lecture we'll talk about some basics of cryptography because you will you already heard a lot about private key public key and hashing and message authentication code in today's talk and many of you know what there many of you don't so in the next lecture will actually familiarize you with all those terms and what they mean and how they are calculated so that will be then the introduction to this course will be complete once we have lecture two on that on crypto concepts thank you [Music] [Music] [Music]
