 oh it's like an Agatha Christie novel or you know it's like a supersuit detective story like whodunit my name is Peter my last name is guppy and you are in my business this is prosperity hardware and welcome [Music] prosperity hardware my mother came up with that name because it meant all the things that she desired prosperity wealth good life we are immigrants that came to the United States in the 70s and my mom she she believed in me and she she invested our savings coming from a poor situation you know growing up poor the American Dream gives you the opportunity to achieve things collecting art is it's another business maybe but eight nine years ago a friend of mine he was a he was an art collector and he he had on some hard times my name is Valerie what yet oh no I have a lot of paint I collect I soaked beetle because I wasn't it paid for rent I need some money I need some money because I'm about to lose my condo and I said well huh I don't really loan money what do you have to sell me and except look I'll sell you these pieces he promised me something presenters also for if he's selling it good then I hung the art on the wall and at the time I didn't have anything in my house like not in my house and I thought how you know it just lit up the room and how it looked so it just piqued my interest and I started to do the research on the art that I collect and realize that is a there's money to be gained in an art collection so it became my second hobby well I don't really do the research she does the research I'm Andi Peters cousin basically I do research for pretty much anything he buys so I started didn't have a choice well Peter came and he showed me the painting he's like this is what I got I think it's my Russian artist okay so had me for you know there was just two initials K M not full name I went to the met museum and I spoke to a lot of people in there and they like basically pointed me in the right direction that it can't possibly be an authentic motivation I thought wow this if I can authenticate this it's gonna be a good win for that's what I thought my name's James Butterick I am a dealer in Russian art well a my limit original will sell for the last auction price was 32 million dollars ballet which had a very large following user master he wanted to do away with traditional types of painting he really was like basically the Godfather of this avant-garde type of spiritism photography the country had been shut off from the world I think you'd argue since about 1920 when he was indeed imprisoned and individualists art would have been hidden destroyed we don't know what happened to a lot of it [Music] that's the thing about the HUD it tells the story of these people struggle by field he's trying to reach out to me and get this painting reestablished we found that the artists did something for Lenin 1918 he had commissioned a contest to see which artist would be doing the artwork for the Winter Palace he had managed to do the design I saw some of the works and it looks a lot worse similar to our piece than what was previously thought [Music] [Applause] [Music] the closer you get to actually authenticating a piece that might be valuable it gives you such a rush the difficulty is with Russian art is because you know Russia was disclosed entity for so long suddenly it opens up and sort of rather conveniently suddenly you know tens of tens of hundreds of pictures appear by avant-garde artists one of the anomalies is there very often signed they almost always have no provenance whatsoever does it have a pro Bono's provenance is extremely important especially with the Russian avant-garde it's absolutely vital so provenance is really the history of the picture from almost from the day it's painted around in 1994 in Moscow it was a very big flea market different stuff and he explains books the new records and I was checked menus and behind it I was to see one man in the Box was selling something paint five six piece I think it maybe is real maybe is not a real he don't know about that because seller was very old men and he was asking those times not expensive around maybe $400 okay I buy sports in an open-air market in Moscow this is a very common occurrence bass or jumble sale every Saturday and Sunday where people would bring all kinds of things if that's the only available provenance that would instantly make me nervous I would always advise everybody whoever comes to me to always seek a second opinion and economics you buy low and you sell high I mean to sell the piece but I need to authenticate it because you can sell a piece of art unless you authenticated I'm Nika Goodman rehab a principal investigator and art analysis and research there's some three strands involved in authentication it involves kind of source ship so the experts I looking at provenance and then the third is scientific analysis of art so I'm looking at at the brushstrokes the consistency of the page looking to see how he handled his edges edges of forms he's known to have used in many cases a cardboard or a paper board and used to have worked against that use that to guide him and provide a straight line things original pictures by my leverage the lines tend to be barrel straight now why would there be an imperfection here forgive me but that strikes me as very odd there was a level of sharp edges in many cases levels of exactitude even though he often used loose brushstrokes texture but what I'm seeing here is these loose wavy edges which suggests that it was applied freestyle with the hand without it about an aid such as a cardboard [Music] as a dealer if I was offered this picture with this provenance and taking into the sin to account the style in which it's painted I wouldn't take it I wouldn't touch it I believe it's real 100 percent I would say 80 percent that's as much as I'm going to give it any person I will be rich but God sells for everybody let me just say it's a tiny tiny tiny percentage now that you left a fingerprint within the red part smack in the middle the next step for me would be to compare the fingerprint on the artwork to tell for sure whether or not it is a mouth which I think he's very passionate about what he likes to do if it's hardware if it's art or whatever it is he gets into it and he 100 percent going back you know it's very exciting to see that somebody could go out and buy a canvas for you know a hundred bucks and it turns out that it's actually worth ten million bucks it's the notion of the nice guy finishing first it's romantic it's thrilling but unfortunately in my experience it is almost unheard of the are chances are probably on a par with winning the lottery you have to have a determination in life and that's one thing I've always had through what my family experienced we were always determined so I'm still determined to authenticate this painting for me it's an adventure I'm gonna keep collecting and trying to find that much [Music] I have one more item that I'm interested in getting authenticated it's not odd it's a $20 Andrew Jackson with the image of Josephine Baker it's the only one of its kind that I know of and it's a misprint from the United States Mint it's possible follow your dreams follow your dreams because it's an adventure and you will be well rewarded for your adventures [Music] you [Music]
