 today we're going to talk about provenance and things like that yep oh you amazing artist today I was thinking that we would discuss something that is always confusing for a lot of people I know that it was confusing for me when I started my art career and we are going to discuss two things provenance what provenance is and also certificates of authenticity and how they work with your artwork I love certificates I don't I don't think you know what we're talking about we have two questions from you guys that we're gonna answer today one of the questions is what do you know or think about certificates of authenticity for any artwork created I have seen some artists including these with the sale of their artwork thanks for your thoughts no thank you mystery person who asked that quite I didn't put their name on there I'm sorry no I think one of the reasons that artists get confused about certificates of authenticity is because there is all this like mystery and stuff behind it like is this artwork real does it have a certificate of authenticity and really when it comes down to it the only time that a certificate of authenticity genuinely applies is when it is an old artwork something that is old where the artist has passed away and there is no real way to prove that legitimately that artist created that work of art when you're authentically dead they can use it to verify this is your art how are you authentically dead how is somebody authentically dead versus not really dead I've actually had those moments where my sales were down a little bit or where there were several months where maybe I wasn't making enough money and I thought about faking my own death and then like having an auction for my work to see what would happen that would it be right yeah it was so rude because you said that you wouldn't even tell me well I can't tell you if I do that cuz then you would give it you don't know how to lie by faking my death social media would go like I have died now my stuff is 50% why would you do 50% to get back to the point a certificate of authenticity is when you got to bring in restores or like an expert on Picasso's they'll take a look at the provenance of the piece and whether or not it makes sense so essentially this expert the person that certifies the artwork is the one that creates a certificate of authenticity you as an artists who are still alive and able to prove that yes I created that piece or no I did not create that piece you don't need to certify the artwork essentially if you're creating a certificate of authenticity for your artwork you are creating what is like a receipt a certificate of authenticity is just a certificate that says that that is authentically a work of art that you created that it wasn't created by somebody who was trying to fake your artwork it does it adds a level of fanciness and it does give people some kind of sense of security which is one of the reasons that I offer certificates of authenticity with with my original artwork you have a piece of paper that certifies that this was originally created by me if you ever see it like I do with my online sales where it's like there's the artworks name and my name and then I sign it for the person that's essentially a certificate of authenticity it just doesn't say certificate of authenticity on it for the longest time especially in the beginning I struggled with the idea of certificates of authenticity because I wasn't really sure what they were how they worked who did I need to call to get them done there are all kinds of websites out there that prey on artists that don't know any better that say you could get a certificate of authenticity with a laser scanned image and all that stuff and it's like you don't need any of that stuff you don't need to pay a whole bunch of money to get a certificate of authenticity for your artwork because it's your artwork you are certifying that it's yours all you got to do is print something out that says certificate of authenticity on it yeah basically my certificate of authenticity says yes I made this and also that I used the best possible materials so I made this and I did my yeah yeah I mean I did my best in fact when I figured out that certificate of authenticity was just that that it's not this like major thing I started creating these right so I made this on Photoshop and it just says this is an original Rafi Perez original artwork certificate of authenticity this warrants and guarantees that your new Rafi Perez artwork titled that I put in the title I gotta take my glasses off apparently this original artwork is authenticated with official artists custom signature stamp I had a stamp that I created I don't really use that anymore located on both this certificate and on your piece along with the item number this is what I was using before and I realized that this was too much of a pain in the butt and then I got totally excited and start creating certificates of authenticity for my textured prints certificates of authenticity for my original art and then I started creating certificates of authenticity for original prints that I create yeah I went crazy and went a little overboard not you yeah apparently I I have that issue where out like I jump on something I'm like I'm gonna do everything now what I do is I print this out I get these done at got prints I designed these on Photoshop and all it is is on one side it says certificate of authenticity and there is room for art by and then artwork details and so then I sign it and put in the title and the item number of it and then I cut this in half one of these goes on the receipt and the other one goes stapled to the back of the painting if you are going to do a certificate of authenticity what I do recommend is that you just have a sheet of paper that says certificate of authenticity I Rafi Perez certify that this is an original Rafi Perez work of art titled so and so and so created such as such and such and then have some kind of item number that you're able to write on the back of your painting or whatever it is that you created and so that certificate of authenticity will be matched up with that work of art you don't really need it unless you want it so just remember it is not something that you need it is not anything fancy you should not be paying somebody a whole bunch of money to get certificates of authenticity done you are the artists you can certify that you created the piece plain and simple oh yeah they do like their there's there's an extra feeling of security when it comes with a certificate of authenticity which is one of the reasons that I offer it is it needed no not only that but it feels cool to have like I have a certificate of authenticity with this work of art yeah whenever I send one out I think the other question I got comes from Robin Limburg and she asks about provenance now our question is several pages long but I there is can you explain provenance okay so the best way to explain provenance is for me to read what's on the Internet provenance is the chronology of the ownership custody or location of a historical object yeah so what does that mean what is provenance provenance essentially is just something that is able to trace back where the artwork originated from and again that's not really something that you need to worry about as a living artist it is more so to prove whether or not a Picasso is an actual Picasso by following the receipts under where it comes from now the other term in which provenance is used is whether or not it was owned by somebody who was famous it was owned by a celebrity or somebody that was famous or by several of them then that provenance adds to the value of the piece because now no longer is this a Picasso but this is a Picasso that was owned by the Queen of England yeah exactly stream like if you bought the artwork and then a hundred years ago you sold it to me but there is a receipt that traces where you bought the artwork and then the fact that I bought the artwork and then whoever bought the artwork next that's provenance that's following the trail of where the object rigea nated from and where it is now that's what people use a lot of times to get a certificate of authenticity to show that this is an offense take whatever it is whether it's a van Gogh or Picasso and it wasn't created by some dude in a small apartment creating duplicates of original art there are a lot of art documentaries we're like you see these these that snobby people in the art world they're like well the piece of problems and what you are hearing is that that piece was owned by somebody that was a celebrity or an icon or something and they're using that term provenance to explain that now this piece is much more expensive because it was owned by the Kardashians yeah that's when you're dealing in that world of the art stock market and that's so much the art world that makes up about 99% of artists and people that buy art you're talking about that 1% they're like this pieces provenance sneezed upon it that's how provenance works in that realm where people use it as a term to raise your prices it is wildly entertaining so to wrap it up certificates of authenticity don't worry about it it's not a mystery it's just something that certifies that you created the artwork provenance just means that there is a trail of receipts that lets you know where the piece originated from and who has owned it since then unless you're talking about the art market provenance oh this piece has provenance that means that somebody who is somebody who is somebody owned this piece and thus that value went up hopefully you found this helpful hopefully I was able to make sense of provenance and certificates of authenticity if you have any questions for us just leave them in the comment section below and thank you so much for watching you guys I think
