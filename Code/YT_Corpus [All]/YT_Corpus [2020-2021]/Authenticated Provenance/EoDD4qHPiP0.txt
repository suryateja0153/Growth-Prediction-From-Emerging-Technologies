 which is uh enabling secure and effective  biomedical data sharing through cyber   infrastructure gateways this is another recorded  uh presentation by tyler phillips and i know   both tyler and sriya goyal are on to answer  questions at the end so mike please play the video hi i'm tyler phillips and i'm here presenting  with chilean goal and we're going over our paper   enabling secure and effective biomedical data  sharing through cyber infrastructure gateways   and word form iupui or indiana university party  university indianapolis and indianapolis indiana so first i'll go over the motivation and introduce  our project so the motivational project so   we have this jet stream uh cloud computing service   funded by the nsf and it's widely used by indiana  healthcare researchers to enhance collaborative   research so the type of data that they're dealing  with there is you know healthcare data related   to like uh policemen and firefighters in the  indianapolis area so although it's widely used   the jet stream security features do not satisfy  the requirements involving sensitive healthcare   data and protected health information so this  drives the need and motivation for securing   the cyber infrastructures that jet stream uses  through an easy to use extensible and robust   cyber security architecture that can protect  sensitive information being shared you know for   these scientific collaborations so here i'll turn  it over to schleyer to give us the introduction   okay uh so uh the aim of the dinosaur project is  to develop a integrated and trustworthy holistic   secure workflow protection architecture that  for cyber infrastructure such as jet stream   the proposed cyber security architecture  supports rules role in data hierarchies as well   as the dynamic changes of road and hierarchical  relations within the scientific infrastructure   so uh now we'll provide a overview of our  project so currently uh dynastop works on openmrs   openmrs is a community developed open source  electronic medical record framework that is used   for exchanging healthcare information so this  system is based on open standards such as hl7   for achieving interoperability with other systems  while transferring or exchanging patient data   so as mentioned currently dinosaur project  works with the openmrs database but however   in the future this can be applied to other  databases so the project runs on an openmrs   image that is a template of virtual machine  with pre-configured security uh techniques   in it that will allow the users to securely  access information stored in this database   so in order to address our motivation of securing  this openmls image and allowing resources to use   it we add some security components into the image  which then researchers can deploy through the jet   stream tool so the some of the security components  we uh embed into the opening glass image here   is biometric capsule based privacy preserving  facial authentication which uh we'll see but   it also includes two-factor authentication we  include dual-level key management which is a   cryptography-based hierarchical access control  model and we include secure digital provenance   so i'll go over each of these in detail later in  the presentation but again these are the security   components for baking into the open mls image okay  so as mentioned earlier that stream is a cloud   computing environment that is supported by nsf for  collaborative research so it is designed to allow   to allow the researchers to get access to  various computing and data analysis resources   so jet stream allows the user to get access to  virtual machine images pre-configured with an   operating system in software that allows to do  scientific computations in domain specific tasks   so openmrs image will be built with all the  security features and components implemented in it   so that when users will deploy a vm with our image  it will allow the users to remotely access and   share sensitive data information to perform their  research so these are some of the steps on how   we can deploy a jet stream vm using openmrs image  so first of all you need to create a create your   exceed account so once you create that so it  will ask you to enter your username and password   and once you are authenticated you will see  this jetstream dashboard that allows you to   launch a new instance of vm so there or you  can click on the images options and then type   our image that is openmrs and you'll see the  openmrs base image the latest version is 1.3   and then you can hit on the launch button that  will allow you to deploy a vm with this image   so now that we know uh you know the overall  architecture of the placard i'll talk about some   of the security components that we're adding into  the open mls image that will allow the researchers   to collaborate you know more easily and securely  so the first aspect is in the current openmos   image the only authentication method or scheme  that they that you're allowed to use is uh   you know like username password login but here  we've added facial authentication so due to the   proliferation of biometric sensors and smart  devices biometric authentication is recently   enlarged as a promising solution to the lost  theft and usability issue facing traditional   authenticated authentication methods so we talked  to some nurses and healthcare uh you know um   professionals in the indianapolis area  and they said that within this open mls   uh you know image it'd be much more helpful  to have you know biometric authentication   which is more useful for them on the job but one  issue facing you know biometric authentication   is that you know if your biometric template or you  know facial attributes are stolen the you know the   feature vector which represents that it's  a lot hard to cancel and really set that up   you know compared to how you would a password  so we need to secure those biometric templates   used for the facial authentication and that's  where this biometric capsule scheme from 2019   comes in how it works is it fuses the biometrics  or that feature vector of the user with the   left-lens subject in order to conceal the user's  biometrics so if you look at the bottom here this   workflow you'll notice that you know you have  the typical biometric pipeline here you take a   user signal you know by taking a picture of  them you sample and pre-process that image   you extract features and then you would perform  some classification but you'll note notice in   the biometric uh pipeline here it also includes  that relevant subject or ls workflow so each user   is assigned an ls and each time the biometrics are  sampled and used for authentication the biometrics   are fused with the biometrics of that relevant  subject to conceal that user's biometrics so   there's a few advantages of this one we can just  make the rls determine based on the user's role   within the organization so then at authentication  time a user needs to only provide their user name   provide the role within the organization to  determine the ls and then allow you know the   picture to be taken to provide a facial biometrics  to the system it should be noted although we're   using the secure facial authentication scheme  here by fusing the biometrics we're still   able to leverage state-of-the-art deep learning  technologies during this facial authentication   so if we think about um next moving on to access  control data access control operation access   control you know with the sensitive healthcare  data um you know in you know uh in the existing   scheme and in many you know healthcare domains  uh organizations typically uh set up the access   control policies which users have access to which  um corresponding data based on a rule-based access   control uh model so what the rule-based access  control model is pretty straightforward you just   define which users have access to which data  but unfortunately you know there's no security   component that's baked into that rule-based access  control model so there's nothing to you know   enforce your access control policies so that's why  we've upgraded um the openmls access control model   to a cryptography based access control model  where there's cryptographic keys given to each   user or a set of group of users like noises and  doctors to actually explicitly enforce those axis   control policies which we define and it raises a  few key issues such as hierarchical model design   how to generate that model how to manage those  cryptographic keys so we use this 2019 ieee tps   paper to carry that out and what that ends up  being from the user's perspective an open mls   image is that you know some uh manager or you  know admin within a hospital organization using   this openmls image can you know how perform a user  friendly or generate a user-friendly definition   of different rules and the data object  leverages to the left here and then we have a   model generation algorithm which automatically  generates all the keys to uh to generate that   access control model and enforce those um you  know access policies which we define so the last   part of this which is still ongoing is where um  adding a secure digital provenance component into   the openmls image so this is based on a 2014 paper  and what this is sort of similar to is blockchain   technology if you're familiar with that so useless  utilize several cryptographic primitives including   cryptographic hash functions private public key  cryptography schemes and a digital signatures in   order to generate a hash chain so what this hash  chain does is it records the ownership um in a of   a digital object that digital objects current  state any modifications performed upon that   digital object as well as you know when a user  is trying to add uh access that digital object   so this will be valuable to you know integrate  into the database component of the open mls image   and this is an ongoing walk as i mentioned okay  so next is a usability experiment so uh once the   biocapsule authentication system was implemented  we did a usability testing to see how it works   so uh we asked the students from privacy and  security course to perform some of the tasks   which is mentioned in the next slide and then send  out a survey to them to answer questions regarding   the three authentication methods used uh so these  were the tasks that the students were asked to   perform first is like logging into openmrs using  three different authentication methods that is   the biometric facial authentication single sign-on  and the username and password method and then they   were asked to perform some of this basic task like  creating patient records and then logging in as   provider as patient with different access and all  those things then uh these were the five variables   on which the questions were based in us that is  the efficiency and effectiveness satisfaction   preference concerns and confidence for the three  authentication methods so once we got the results   we developed a formative format of partial least  square structured equation modeling to measure the   relationship between the usability and security so  from the results it was found that the biocapsule   facial authentication was the most preferred  usable and secure among the three authentication   methods used so this concludes that are that the  dinosaur project allows to build a secure holistic   multi-layer protecting cyber security architecture  that can be ported to multiple virtual machines   on jet stream it allows for uh scientific data  so that researchers and students can remotely   access and share protected data in a convenient  yet finely controlled manner thank you thank you okay well well great um so i know both  uh tyler and trio are on so feel free   to under meet yourself and anybody has  any questions you put them in group chat   i'll start by saying i think it's super cool  that you all are reporting actually you did and   reporting on a usability study because i think  that's one of the things that in the community   we don't talk about enough we i know we don't  perform them enough uh because you know they   that's really important the the end usability  so i guess i'll just heat up as to is there   anything else you want to say about the usability  study i don't know maybe did you look at any type   of visual accessibility type aspects of it or  anything like that yeah so i think um the the   main motivation is to um you know get resources  more flexibly in terms of you know the security   components that they're using if they're  using this openmls dimensional research   so you know we can add all the security  components you know under the sun but at the   end of the day it used to be usable so uh we have  a couple different experiments underway you know   primarily led by schleyer here but um but they're  just uh getting feedback from students and these   students are both you know taking our uh security  courses at our university as well as students   studying you know uh you know more things more  on the health care side of things so we can get   both of those perspectives so um the advantage of  the biometric uh you know authentication that we   found is you know once you get the it's kind of  comfortable so at first you know getting it all   right just stored in the system with your face  and stuff but once you get past that initial   point a lot of people before that the username  and password because you know most phones and   smart devices nowadays have the um you know the  biometric sensor or embedded camera you know   in them so you know you have that flexibility  to use that you know a version of the image great um we do have another question chad and it  is is the data actually in the vm along with the   tools uh so at this stage we're just using uh fake  data you know just to make sure all the tools are   in place but what you know we're on the last year  of this uh nsfcici project so now we're moving on   to you know this uh experiment the you know more  experimental phase past development where we're   getting this usability feedback and that is you  know you know um part of our plan over the next   you know final year of this project is to start  trying to you know integrate real data and see   you know how our intended audience you know these  researchers to receive you know our final adapter
