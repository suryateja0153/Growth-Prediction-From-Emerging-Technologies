 hey guys thanks for tuning in to another video on forgottenweapons.com i'm ian mccollum and i'm here today at rock island taking a look at a czechoslovakian vz54 sniper rifle this is one component of the complete arms upgrade package that czechoslovakia adopted in the 1950s they would of course get the vc52 semi-auto pistol the vz52 semi-auto rifle the vz-52 machine gun there were a lot of model 52s going on but they also wanted a brand new sniper rifle and the guy they tasked with designing it was a gun gun designer by the name of otakar galash he had gone to work in the field in 1933 he actually spent a lot of time working in the uk but after world war ii he came back to czechoslovakia and one of his first major tasks was in 1949 uh he undertook a pretty formal like a wide-scale study of sniper weapons and in the wake of this he designed what he thought would be like the best sniper rifle for the czechoslovakian military to adopt and that was a mauser based rifle in uh 8 by 64 necked down to 762 by 64. which is an interesting package that didn't really pass muster in starting around 1950 it became clear that czechoslovakia was going to not not exactly copy soviet small arms but wanted to have interchangeability with them at least with ammunition at least in some rifles not the vz52 rifle but side note so anyway galosh is still in charge of the sniper rifle development program and he puts together prototypes uh two different prototypes one that is a mauser based system and one that is a most in the gap based system these are designated the zg 51 rifles and they do some testing and they ultimately they end up adopting the most negative based rifle probably on the basis more of politics than of technical capability because it's hard to imagine a mouser-based system not being better than a mozan based one but they adopt the most nagant they want to have this uh pseudo compatibility with the soviet union and that eventually leads to the vc54 it is chambered for 762 by 54 rim that's the main thing that it gets well one of the two uh the other is that uh the the factory is able to make these uh the cz factory is able to make these from uh stockpiles of most nagon rifles that they already have they've got like sixteen thousand mosin nagants in in warehouses and they figure hey you know we can save some money by building guns up from those instead of making everything from scratch which sounds great but this is like almost every time someone tries to do this it kind of backfires on them and it sort of would here as well so the rifle is adopted in 1954 production's supposed to start in 55 there are a lot of production delays that are involved in both the the prototyping and the development of this system as well as its actual manufacturer and manufacturer doesn't really actually get started until 1956. ultimately about 5500 of these would be made but we'll talk about that in a minute let's start by taking a closer look at what galosh came up with take a quick look at the markings here on the receiver she is the czech arsenal code uh this indicates that the rifle was built at cc's factory in uh which is in southeastern czechoslovakia the 56 is the date the t is the check proof mark on there the crossed swords there are the czechslovakian military acceptance mark we have a serial number of charlie 3214 i'm not entirely sure what the serial number system was on these rifles i suspect that it's very much like the uh the cz50 vz52 pistols where they deliberately obfuscated the production numbers by giving them quasi quasi-random serial numbers i have seen examples of these with a c h and f prefixes and i've seen there's one that i found online actually that had a five digit serial number so the idea that this is like batches of 10 000 starting at a and moving up as you would typically expect i don't think that's the actual case here but i don't have better data for you so then we have a commercial reproofing down there the scope mount is also serialized as is the scope itself and you can see it's got its own uh three-letter code there this is a myoptiscope it's a two and a half power scope as you can see right there czech slovakia did not use the russian pu scopes they developed their own or got their own from meopta which is based in czechoslovakia so it's a good little scope not anything particularly sophisticated you can see the windage and elevation it's got a bullet drop compensated uh an elevation cam there that's graduated out to a thousand meters it has a dovetail mounting on the side of the receiver that the scope is mounted to so the scope can come off i'm not going to pull this one off because these screws are on there tighter than i can loosen by hand and i don't want to take a pair of pliers to them the rear sight is the length of a 2000 meter rear sight but it only goes up to 1200 meters and that is because half of the adjustment markings on here the adjustment notches are in 50 meter increments and i think that is a good indication of how serious they were about getting good accuracy out of these rifles this wasn't supposed to be something capable of just harassing fire this was intended to be a true sniper's rifle galosh himself the designer was not just a firearms designer but also a pretty serious marksman he spent a lot of time practicing he was a good shot and he understood what went into making a good accurate rifle the stock designed for the vz54 has a very nice pistol grip to it and it has a really good cheek weld to it unlike the the soviet mosin snipers where you have kind of a chin weld this to me is very comfortable the scope is low enough and the stock is high enough uh that it just it works out very well ergonomically the receivers and the bolt components are original soviet manufacture ones that czechoslovakia had in its possession you can see that the bolt handles have been modified so that you can open the bolt here and not hit the scope these these look sporterized but well it doesn't count as sporterization when a national military factory does it on large scale on a few of the parts like right there you can still see the original soviet uh proof marks on some of these here's another example the bottom of the magazine has been serialized to match the receiver as by the way has the trigger guard there are new czechoslovakian serial numbers all over this rifle but you can see some of the original soviet uh proof marks on there that have been partially removed when they redid the serial number there are also a number of clear mauser influences in this galosh obviously liked the mauser and appreciated what it was capable of so you'll see a couple spots where locking screws have been added and a very sort of pre-war mauser style the same thing was done to the rear action screw here so the the deal is that this small screw tightens down and it simply prevents the main screw from rotating under recoil or you know being bounced around you can also see a very clear mouse or inspiration to the rear of this handguard you know if you didn't know better that that could have come straight off of you know a 1930s mauser rifle the stock and handguard are cut nice and short to avoid uh putting pressure on the barrel the barrel itself is about 30 millimeters about an inch and a quarter shorter than a standard 9130 barrel a little heavier in profile as well and it has again a mauser style hooded front sight post note that the front sight is in this case a round post but not tapered at all that's that's the backup iron sight if you don't have the scope and then we have one more serial number out here side mounted sling again mauser-esque there so here's the iron sight picture and the iron sights are actually usable underneath the scope there you go it's a little tight down there but it does work as for the scope itself it has the exact same style of reticle as the soviet pu it's just a heavy cross bar with a pointer in the center and then the adjustment simply moves the reticle within your field of view and then uh just the one other thing that strikes me about these rifles is the that yellow light color of the wood combined with the black painted finish of the rifle is distinctively czechoslovakian if you find a really nice vz52 or 5257 they'll have this same combination of of colors you've got the really light wood and the the black painted rifles so i think it's a really actually a really nice looking rifle uh if you don't know what you're looking at they appear to simply be you know someone's reasonably well sporterized most in the gun but the reality is these are extremely capable so uh the czechoslovakian standard for these was that they had to make a 10 round group in a 50 centimeter by 50 centimeter rectangle at 800 meters and if we that that's a little hard to convert into a typical american minute of angle grouping but it is pretty darn close uh to a one minute of angle group at 875 yards so a a 10 inch a 50 centimeter circle instead of 50 centimeter square is just a tiny shade over one minute of angle at that range and that's that's no mean feat like that that requires a seriously good rifle good shooter and good ammunition especially when you're talking about something that is literally based on surplus most nagant receivers so you can understand why a tremendous number of the mosins that that were available as donor rifles failed to pass inspection um and just weren't good enough for use in these and the product they came out with was really quite excellent as i said earlier about 5500 of these were built as far as the best information i can find on them and they basically were manufactured until they ran out of donor most nagant parts to work with and when they ran out of gun when they ran out of donor guns they just stopped making them and that happened in 1958 so production of these rifles only went for a couple of years basically 56 through 58 and then they were done and that was it the rifles would be in front line czechoslovakian service until the 1970s when they were replaced with svd dragonobs at that point obviously some would stick around in the reserves for a period a lot of them were also transferred to police organizations where they would remain in service for several more decades in the early 1990s some of these were actually modernized a bit they were given new sort of modern competition style stocks with bipods on them the scope mounting was revised to allow them to mount pso scopes the same sort of scope you would see on the dragonov that gives them a lot more magnification and an illuminated reticle so more capability than the original two and a half power meoptas here and those are designated either the vz5490 or 5491 depending on who's talking about them so some of those are also still around but uh overall i think these are a really cool example of one of the the few countries that perhaps could rival finland in improving and uh well getting the most out of a mohs in the gun so congrats to galosh and czechoslovakia on this hopefully you guys enjoyed the video this particular rifle actually came out of the collection of one larry vickers which is a cool extra bit of provenance for it thanks for watching you
