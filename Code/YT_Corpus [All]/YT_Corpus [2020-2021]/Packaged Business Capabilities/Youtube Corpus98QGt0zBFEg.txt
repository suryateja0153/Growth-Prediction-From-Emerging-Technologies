 [Music] the past few months have been hard and it has been inspiring to see how people and organizations have been coming together to help each other during these times of change in the current environment there is an increased demand for business continuity and innovation i've been hearing these two asks consistently in every customer conversation first as you can imagine is cost in the current environment everyone is looking at cost saving with renewed urgency second is agility in dealing with the pandemic every one of you wants to innovate faster to keep up with the changing customer behaviors we are already working with many of you and are looking forward to working with all of you across industries to empower you and start addressing these needs today our mission is to accelerate innovation in every organization through best in category developer velocity and operational automation because of our focus on this google cloud has established itself as a partner of choice to many of you when it comes to application modernization in fact our application modernization customers have been able to achieve more than 35 cost saving by auto migrating and more than 75 percent through automation and re-platforming not only that customers have been able to innovate eight times faster by using our serverless solutions you will hear more about google cloud's cloud run from media market in our accelerate application development keynote today we're going to show you how you can achieve this level of cost saving and speed application modernization is hard it's more than just adapting to new technologies it means dealing with talent fragmentation as you adapt multiple clouds and api fragmentation as you start transforming your applications so let's talk about where this complexity comes from first every company has multiple teams and for all of you operators in the audience you can appreciate the complexity that comes with a growing number of teams some teams want to run containers others want to run vms and yet others are going serverless some workloads need to stay on premises others can be found in different clouds how do you manage all of this without complexity spiraling out of control second there are many roads to modernization knowing which path is best for you and your industry can make a tremendous difference almost every customer asked me what are some of the best practices for me to follow finally in today's climate there is more urgency than ever before to go faster accelerate developer velocity and reduce costs it is essential to know how you should prioritize and identify what needs to get done first every day i talk to cios and ctos who recognize it's time to expect more they want their teams to engage with google's engineers and work together they asked me for the latest best practices to co-innovate and build together they expect a secure migration path to hybrid and multi-cloud adoption all this while integrating with existing security investments and protecting all their assets including users services and data they expect google to help them maintain a consistent security posture across diverse environments evolve to an end-to-end zero trust model and meet their compliance requirements to help you with your application modernization journey google cloud provides three differentiated capabilities first to better manage complexity we provide you with a consistent development and operations experience no matter if you're running natively on google cloud or using hybrid multi-cloud or edge environments based on open apis you can do this without the fear of being locked in through proprietary technology our customers like plane are already using google cloud to help them with a multi-cloud strategy second to make sure you have the right plan in place we give you and your developers industry-leading guidance on how to develop run operate and secure application on this platform and all the tooling you need to go with it these practices come from years of experience running application at massive scale and working alongside thousands of enterprise and cloud native customers you benefit from practices like extremely fast builds automated elasticity and standard policy across environments to help you drive speeded scale with built-in security and compliance you can also easily adapt a site reliability engineering approach to operations and finally since you want to see the impact of application modernization right away we provide you a data-driven prioritization and benchmarking methodology to see what and how to improve you can benchmark your performance against internal teams or industry peers you can quickly identify areas of improvement and get prescriptive guidance to make the most of your cloud investment in fact we internally use this technology today in our own products including google cloud ai and ml services the recently launched bigquery omni apogee hybrid and many more we have been seeing tremendous momentum and customer interest in working with us on application modernization in q2 of 2020 alone more than a hundred thousand companies use our application modernization platform and services including gke anthos cloud functions and cloud run to build and render mission critical enterprise grade applications there are many reasons customers choose us for instance gke clusters can scale up to 15 000 nodes this is the largest number of supported nodes of any cloud-based kubernetes service and three times the number of nodes supported by open source kubernetes this is very valuable for customers like bayer crop sciences and twitter who can take advantage of this scale and a research study we run showed that our platform is so easy to use that 98 of first-time cloud-run users are able to deploy their app on their first try for many of these customers and those is where the modernization journey starts with the anthos announcement last year we painted the vision of a modern managed platform that would help developers deliver software faster and safer and offer operators a consistent secure service across any infrastructure provider last year anthos became generally available in just a short time we've seen customers across industries get the promised benefits anthous is already in production at hsbc heb xlx chiata and many other for hybrid use cases anzos brings the best of cloud services to you instead of having you move to the cloud antos is a google managed platform that extends google cloud services and engineering practices to your environment so you can modernize apps faster and establish operational consistency across on-prem and any clouds in anthos no matter where you are on your modernization journey you can benefit from declarative operations and automation to give your developers the best velocity possible anywhere you choose this in turn leads to immediate cost saving by simplifying operations on any cloud and on the edge one customer we have had the privilege of partnering with is major league baseball major league baseball is using google cloud and unthought to deliver real-time analytics and insight to their fans with workloads running both in the cloud and at each of their stadiums now let's hear from chris amy vp of technology infrastructure at major league baseball welcome chris happy to have you join us today hi all happy to be here i'd first like to ask you can you tell us a little bit about mlb and why you chose google cloud yeah sure so major league baseball it's america's pastime you know we have a hundreds of millions of viewers fans and extreme amounts of data that we process and analyze we know that google cloud has a very large expertise in ai and big data and that's where they build their core products from you know advancing baseball stats that the fans love with google cloud's ai and ml solutions is our current path forward anthos enables us to take advantage of that whether we're running in google cloud or we're running on-prem in our stadiums google cloud and anthos were chosen because of google's container expertise that's great to hear now can you tell us a little more about why you chose antos and how it is helping you so ethos is the vehicle that we're using to run our applications anywhere whether that's going to be in a ballpark or in the cloud no we have situations where we have to do computing in the park for latency reasons such as we're delivering stats you know in stadium to fans or to broadcast or to the school board right specifically anthos helps us process all that data and get it back to whoever is consuming it uniformity across this deployment environment is especially key for our developers no they don't want to know the differences between whether they're running in a cloud or they're running on-prem or in a data center or in our stadiums this also gives us ability to you know have an event that's at yankee stadium and if something happened we could take that and run our code across the area across the city city field where the nets play and just continue broadcasting and having everything continue to run as it did prior now lastly if we had any issue in the stadium we can ship that data up to google cloud and process it there that is really amazing can you tell us how this journey looked like for you be happy to so 18 months ago we started our journey you know of modernizing our application stack we had previously you know had their applications packaged up and we were now moving down this path of containerizing everything and using that as our path forward of how we're going to deploy them on applications from this we had uniformity across all of our environments whether that's a miniature data center that we have running in the stadium a couple of on-prem data centers or in google cloud so we chose containers and we were well down the path and then we were coming to the problem of what do we do once we want to run this in stadium we saw it at google and you know notice that antos was coming and it seemed like the simplest and easiest solution to go and manage these applications and deploy them no matter where that be in stadium or in the cloud no that journey took us about 12 months and we're happy to say that opening day this year we've been running applications in the stadium on anthos that's awesome chris thank you so much for joining us it was a pleasure talking to you today and now i'd like to introduce ken who is going to tell you more about what's new in the world of antos thanks eyal each year i get to give you a recap of our new innovation but more importantly every day i get to work with you our customers to identify ways that technology can improve your business and it's not just about technology we learn from you and share our own practices around team and culture one thing that stood out to me over the past 12 months is the impact anthos is starting to have on your organization specifically you are seeing impact on improvement in developer and operator efficiency acceleration of business innovation with easier access to google managed services with a security first approach all while saving money and using the cloud more efficiently so let's look at each one of these in detail first let's talk about improving developer and operator efficiency anthos is a software driven platform that is generally available on gcp in private data centers and on aws this provides you a central control plane and consistent approach to service delivery wherever your workloads run with service automation along with advanced telemetry and out-of-the-box service level objectives anthos helps to proactively monitor applications and catch issues in real time before impacting users sre best practices help minimize outages and improve business continuity antos configuration is data and applies consistent policies to any or all of your infrastructure saving your team significant effort and eliminating manual errors all of these benefits apply both to traditional apps and cloud native ones antos pulls all of your workloads into a single platform which helps your developers and operators avoid the context switching that slows them down we are continuously improving how anthos can make your teams even more productive and efficient you can now easily bring more of your clusters into antus with antos attach clusters you can bring in any kubernetes conformant clusters into anthos and benefit from the advanced capabilities that antos provides like declarative configuration and service automation get greatly improved service to service networking controls and visibility with anthos you can now easily adopt best practices like canary rollouts and global load balancing without additional overhead you can also benefit for the first time with common increase across multiple kubernetes clusters this means for workloads running on google cloud you get multi-regional multi-cluster availability for your application through health checking and traffic failover you also benefit from low latencies so your clients always reach the closest instance of the app and transparent cluster migration when you need to upgrade from the beginning we designed anthos so it can be available to you anywhere over the past year we've spoken to many of you to better understand what anywhere looks like for you having started off with google cloud and hybrid deployments earlier this year we announced general availability of anthony aws our early adopters also continue to help us as we work towards bringing new support for azure later this year it is clear to us that you want anthos for environments without requiring a third-party hypervisor earlier this year we announced that we are working to bring anthos to bare metal servers as well it has been exciting to see the overwhelming interest in this offer and the potential it unlocks today i'm announcing the beta availability of antos for bare metal that you can run on-prem and at your edge locations we are in active development with key strategic design partners looking to reduce cost by avoiding the hypervisor text that's a big deal for most customers this will also help you minimize unnecessary overhead and unlock new cloud and edge use cases in fact early adapters for antos bare metal also includes google we are internally working towards using antos bare metal as a platform to run containers internally for our production systems let's now talk about the second major way anthos is making a difference for customers namely the way it extends google cloud to more places our customers look to use google technology and engineering practices wherever their data is with anthos bigquery omni is coming to aws and our premiere ai services are coming to your enters environments our first hybrid ai capability speech to text on-prem is now generally available on top of our popular speech-to-text api this brings google cutting-edge speech recognition technology to anthos with speech-to-text on-prem you have full control over your infrastructure and protected data for data residency and compliance while leveraging google cloud's ai capabilities right in your own data centers so your data doesn't need to leave your premises hybrid ai is a business differentiator for customers like iron mountain it helps iron mountain build software quickly in the cloud and seamlessly deploy on premises for apps with stringent compliance and residency requirements finally it's about getting velocity and multi-cloud benefits along with a security-first approach antos follows principles of least privilege and extends defense in depth to your deployments it simplifies release managements and automate software updates and security patches to maintain the security posture of your platform through github's and uniform policy as code it continuously validates environment conflicts and alerts you about policy violations it also scans pre-deploy and runtime images and ensures only trusted workloads run as you can manage your policies uniformly across all of your environments you gain operational efficiency thereby saving on retraining and operational costs this consistency offered by antos reduces risk improves your security posture and reduces complexity all while offering best-in-class capabilities today i'm announcing antos identity service you can extend your existing identity solutions to work with antos and streamline your onboarding process as part of this offering you can enable openid connect to access anthos clusters running on multiple environments antos identity service supports openid connect today and is generally available for on-premises and beta for anthocon aws support for additional protocols and environments will also be coming soon this is valuable because as you modernize you can leverage your existing identity investments and enable consistency across environments antos identity service simplifies identity without requiring you to reinvent your existing identity solutions and with that i'm going to hand off to paulie to tell you more about how customers are using anthos thanks hen in the past year and a half since anthos became generally available we've seen tremendous interest in anthos this interest comes from a diverse group of enterprises ranging from heb in retail and macquarie bank in financial services to organizations like mlb who you heard from earlier today many of these customers are now in production and seeing significant benefits from anthos already anthos has enabled query banks development teams to roll out features faster while also reducing the complexity of keeping their deployments secure and cost efficient in fact in a forester study we recently commissioned we found that among customers who use anthos developers become more productive as we help them reduce non-coding tasks by up to 38 in partnering with these customers to help them ship faster while spending less we built out a broad portfolio of solutions to help with a number of common migration and modernization journeys for many traditional workloads migration provides an excellent opportunity to make quick gains and savings on costs that stem from both hardware and licensing with our auto migration solution migrate for anthos you can seamlessly migrate your windows workloads to containers saving compute costs by improving workload efficiency through bin packing and those can also help you with migrating your cloud foundry workloads with kf on anthos this enables your operations teams to benefit from the anthos declarative model without disruption to your development teams the forester study i mentioned earlier showed that customers were able to accelerate migration by 58 to 75 for many enterprises java applications form a big portion of their brownfield application portfolio with anthos you can easily choose between migrating modernizing and refactoring these java applications this leads to increased developer productivity and drives end-to-end automation including test deployment and security we also have specific purpose-built solutions to automate governance compliance and data residency for regulated industries such as financial services retail and public sector running a hybrid or multi-cloud environment typically means having to deal with multiple partners and managing multiple skus for each environment this can cause your billing and procurement process to get out of control with unnecessary overhead anthos offers uniquely flexible consumption options like pay as you go and subscription offers so you can select the option that works for your business with consistent billing across diverse cloud environments you can accelerate new service delivery while simplifying your procurement model for existing deployments with google cloud marketplace you can procure third-party containerized applications for security analytics development tools and more these kubernetes applications are easy to deploy and can be uniformly managed anywhere you're running answers in fact purchase of our partners as offerings to google cloud marketplace have increased 3x since the beginning of 2020. we're also seeing customers use marketplace for million dollar deals many of you are just embarking on this modernization journey while others are well on your way with critical workloads already in production no matter where you are in your journey we invite you to take the next step to google cloud along with our expansive list of ecosystem partners these partners are actively investing to deliver a unified and simple experience together we've been able to help customers achieve significant benefits up to 55 percent increase in operation efficiency and up to 75 improvement in efficiency of running security tasks these improvements translate directly into lower costs and faster time to market one of our customers saw 13 x reduction in lead times with results like these it's no surprise that companies that don't embrace modernization risk not just falling behind their competitors but also behind new entrants eager to leave frog incumbents modernization can be incredibly daunting but with anthos we've simplified your modernization journey so you can focus on building and delivering amazing services for your customers this week on nextonair you will have the opportunity to learn about all the ways you can kickstart your application modernization journey and hear from other companies who are also on the same journey i encourage you to take the opportunity to watch our breakout sessions to learn more about anthos and trianthus yourself using antho sample deployment on google cloud marketplace we look forward to partnering with you on this journey of digital transformation thank you
