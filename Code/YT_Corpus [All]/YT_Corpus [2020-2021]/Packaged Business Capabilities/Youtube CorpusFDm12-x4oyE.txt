 [Music] thank you for all joining me here today in my home office in the san francisco bay area i'm thrilled to be joined by my good friend danette uh who's going to talk to you with me about really service and and our you know our overall collective path to service excellence so by way of introduction i'm sean myers i run product marketing for our cx service and other solutions and a little known fact about me is that i started one of my very first jobs out of college was actually helping to manage a call center so cool thing i had a great experience there i learned a lot about people management about the management of operations so a lot of great foundations for me so tonight maybe before we dive in can you tell us a little bit about yourself and maybe your background in service yeah thanks sean my name is danette beale and i'm a senior product manager with oracle cx service and our team specializes in strategy and just like you i started my career in customer service and i've been helping some of the largest companies in the world design their service strategies and a little bit about myself i would consider myself a service aficionado i'm almost like a so many of wine but for service um you know i really love to immerse myself in it and just understand and learn as much about customer service as possible that's a really fun comparison and and i i actually like it so now what you're telling me is i have to come to you with all of my sort of service situation to wine pairings so uh i'll look into that so you know speaking of jeff and chris i love the content they talked as that sort of literal stroll through a ton of interesting you know topics and issues and and conversations i thought that was very exciting and you know rob as well i think set up our day today with just some really great things including his to really top three priorities about you know really how as service professionals we really have to think about how every customer service interaction really must matter about we just have to think beyond only service really you know our customers have experiences with our brands across many areas and so we need to think of that and really the importance of service is you know one of the key foundational elements of how brands build long-term customer loyalty so you know danette i think everyone in the audience today is a consumer as well as a service professional right so i think you know we know as consumers we value our relationships being personalized and you know relevant to our time to our place in the ways we want so you know what is your thoughts today danette about really customer expectations and and really you know in the in the vein of a service interaction what that should look like yeah you know sean it comes down to that we're all customers and we all have expectations of the brands that we work with every single day for instance i'm an introvert by nature and i'm also a mom i think the thought of picking up a phone and actually talking to somebody just makes me a little nauseous inside like chat is the channel of choice for me and it's the one that works the best and that makes it really hard for companies as they start to design a strategy because they have to find something that fits everybody and what makes it even more difficult is when a customer engages with a company you know we see them as different departments like marketing and commerce and service but to them it's just one engagement there's no marketing experience or commerce experience when they're shopping so this all directly impacts customer service and how a customer views a company yeah i mean that's a really great point right it's all about that you know that how do we expect those engagements to work and i'm sure i mean i'm sure most of the members of our audience are nodding their heads right now but you know i think there's the challenge right under that which is how do we start to get better how do we get but to where we can have those consistency of you know inner interactions and and the sort of the level of personal personalization and relevancy that we'd all want from those interactions so before we really dive into the content today i'd love to really get to know our audience a little more right so we'd love to do that with a poll and and this first poll is really about you kind of looking in to yourself and your operations and saying what is you know that sort of main thing what's that key thing that's standing in your way from delivering what you would think of as a world-class customer service experience you know and i'm sure if you look across these there's several options and opportunities between you know lack of data you know the skill set of your agents maybe you know budget we all have limits to our budget or even you know maybe you have issues with some of the technologies or maybe it's something else and you know likely it's a little bit here a little bit there but if you had to pick one right if you had to sort of say you know what's the thing that if i could solve tomorrow with my magic wand i could move forward more efficiently you know what would you say well it's an interesting result and i think it's certainly something we not surprising to see so you know i think that's what most people are challenged with again as i mentioned a little bit of all these things and so it can be kind of hard to understand well what do i go tackle first and next etc and so that's where we came in right oracle is partnering with hundreds and hundreds of service leaders and really tried to help the collective you know environment and and the the all of us who are focused on service issues really come up with a framework right a framework of helping us understand where each of us as you know service leaders are in our progress towards building these world-class experiences and really broken that down into four stages right and so you know each of these stages has different aspects to it when you're thinking of different business challenges different opportunities you might have and really the goal is to you know figure out where you might be in your own operations and then how to get to that next level so let's jump right in let's talk about this first level this is one that we call inbound service now inbound it's again the beginning the the sort of the foundational layer the the starting point and so really at this level you're doing your best to just sort of react right you're just trying to keep up with all of the volume of service requests those service requests are probably at this stage coming in through one primary channel you know maybe it's phone perhaps it's email and and so really this is sort of where you know the basics start and so danette now if you think of this stage you know this inbound service what do you think about as a service leader you know and as so you're managing your day-to-day yeah you know there's still companies out there that have an inbound service strategy as their main strategy but to be completely honest with you that's becoming fewer and farther between even the companies such as the dmv or the telecommunications companies out there that weren't necessarily known for good service are seeing the value in driving and delivering exceptional service where we're seeing it mostly is that companies start to revert back to event cloud service during emergency situations we actually saw that quite a bit with the pandemic i mean i had a personal experience where i was trying to change some airline flights and i was in the middle of chatting because again that's my channel of choice and they shut the chat off mid mid chatting with somebody and directed me over to phone which was then a six hour cue just to get back in line with somebody so again when i'm talking to customers and companies about what those first steps should be i would say if you find yourself an inbound you need to start investing in self service you know a knowledge base that's a dynamic knowledge base not just static faqs can help you be nimble and move very swiftly when you don't have a lot of resources to be able to support real-time engagements yeah i love that point and sort of nimble in the right way right because i think i had a similar experience to you with you know i i don't like the phone i will admit it uh and you know i i wanted to engage over chat and it wasn't they turned it off and so that for me is really a frustrating experience right and that's really what creates dissatisfaction um and and for for i think service professionals at this level that's probably one of the main motivating factors to try and do better they understand the limitations are really creating you know negative value if you will for their for their customers and so that's why you'd want to go do something and really make a change and that's where you sort of think of how do you push forward to that next level that next level we've really referred to as foundational this is foundational service where you know think of it as you've got the foundation laid right you have those understanding of the customer problems your ability to really react and respond to them over that sort of main primary channel all ticked and tied that that you've got done so now you shift focus right you can think about well how can i add new channels of engagement right how can i maybe improve the efficiencies of my team you might be focused on metrics like agent turnover and you know time to resolution these are the things that probably occupy your mind during the day and you know actually this one to me as i look across the model i i sort of you know this this is where i cringe i think of myself in that you know way back many years ago as being sort of the foundational person around you know dealing with issues like agent turnover and what that was doing to not just my cost structure but even the experience of you know the customers i was trying to support and even the agents themselves so you know if you were talking to me back in the day jeanette what would you tell me yeah you know there's i would say most companies find themselves squarely within the foundational service strategy and honestly a lot of companies have great success in that strategy in foundational they see a good balance between their channels and their self-service and they're able to get moving with their goals but what we find from service professionals who are successful in this area is that they really focus on analytics they understand the impacts of their business they understand how their channels are reacting and they're able to experiment just slightly to see if they can get better gains and efficiency say maybe average handle time is something that they care about so we recently just worked with a company who was experiencing something just like you talked about they had 100 turnover agent turnover year over year and honestly that sounds probably pretty scary but i think a lot of companies out there are focusing with this same problem but because they understood their business and they knew their analytics they were able to experiment and they actually decided to move to work from home strategy now we're all used to work from home now but this is way before everything that's going on and it was kind of a taboo thing to even talk about but what they found is that by allowing their agents to work from home they were able to get a bigger pool of agents to pull from and they found people who were actually passionate about selling their products and so as an example they not only had better experience for their agents but they have a better experience for their customers and they were able to reduce that agent turnover and save costs at the same wow it's it's amazing and i think it's it's so interesting to see how you know work from home is a great example of what's just radically changed in the service industry um and so you know going on from there i think that's a great story and and really i could see how it leads this into the next level right and so you know we call the next level advanced service and this is where you know as a service leader you probably sort of think hey i got this i've got my arms around my team i've got my arms around my processing my capabilities and so now you think okay what's next right you know you might be shifting towards thinking of how service shifts from being just a thing you've got to have in place to react to something where it's maybe more of a strategic capability of your company right so maybe how can you operationalize all those efficiencies and really make continuously better and better and you know maybe you're thinking about things like you know customer satisfaction metrics and other ways of measuring your own success and so you know the data is all a big piece of this right so you're probably very focused on building that deepest richest picture of your customer engagements and how they're working and you know it's possible at this stage even that you might be starting to share those insights that you generate in your own service context with other parts of the organization so they can benefit and so i think that's this is a i'm a big data nerd so this is kind of an exciting stage when we just keep adding on to the data we have as service leaders and so you know danette you've seen a lot of folks get to this level and what do you think they're thinking about what are they trying to improve upon what's your opinion on what's you know the right thing to be do once you're getting to these sort of the better stages in this sort of excitement of what we can do next yeah sean so this is where you talk about being a data nerd i'm a data nerd as well but i'm a bigger service nerd and this is where the magic really starts to happen with service and where i get really excited you know as companies start to move from foundational to advanced service they start to realize that prioritizing service and their customers will help them achieve their bigger goals their organizational goals but they still have to be aware of cost in inundating their contact centers so it's really important to them to be able to do that in a way that is safe and digital automation is actually something that we found has helped companies move into this advanced level but has not overwhelmed them so we have a company that we work with an organization called turning point that provides social services to over 300 locations in the uk and my husband is a social worker john and i can tell you when it actually matters when service actually matters these people are changing lives you know we talk about service but these are the ones that it's life or death situations sometimes and turning point again is using oracle service to provide life-changing changes for their uh citizens and so they use intelligent advisor for scheduling and this again is something where they've been able to reduce down to from four weeks down to two days the time to get a patient in to their services and this is life again critical and they're also using digital assistant in a very interesting way if say a patient has an anxiety attack they can text with turning point and they actually talk to the digital assistant and that digital assistant can give them relaxation techniques or just get them through that moment before they can actually go and see somebody live in person so again automated channels is allowing turning point as well as other organizations personalized service without restraining their resources and this is really important at this level so another area that can really help is connected service and sean if it's okay with you i would love to tell just a personal story of my own you know we're all going through this thing right now this pandemic and back in march my poor son just wanted to go and do something so he said you know what let's go camping that meant camping in his room but within five minutes of setting up the tent my 11 year old actually ended up breaking the tent pole so i had to make a decision was i going to replace this pole and look at this face for the next however long or was i going to go and actually purchase a new tent now obviously with the situation going on i wasn't too jazzed about going out in person and finding a tent so i decided to replace the pole and i started to engage with this company online and immediately i was super excited you know i turned to my husband and i said this is going to be one of the best engagements that i've ever had with a company and it was the way that nick talked to me the agent he said oh dang did yours fail with you now sean how many times have you talked to your bank and they speak to you like that probably never because it's not appropriate but for a a outdoor enthusiast company it was absolutely appropriate and this is why i'm so excited because customers are really starting to look at authenticity as something that they really want to focus on customers value authenticity and companies are picking up on that and that's exactly what this company was doing so as we kind of move forward this i knew that it was going to be special and they did not let me down so as you know we continued chatting into this experience i was immediately taken back and let down by this company who said you know this tentpole we can't replace it but we have a great warranty and i was like oh great i don't remember when i bought this tent it was maybe 11 years ago i had no clue where i bought it from but i want you to pay attention to the timestamp that's on that text message of 1044 because within one minute of asking me my email he was not only able to find my receipt but he knew exactly where i bought that from so the end story to this is that he packaged everything up for me he sent me the information that i needed i took a picture of the tent pole and within two weeks during a pandemic we were able to get this temple replaced because of this warranty process now again they were able to do this because of that connected data he had immediate access to the information that he needed even though it was outside of service and as we move forward you know i didn't want to just stop there i actually wanted to engage with this company and tell them how much i appreciated them and so i reached out to their vp on on social media and i said hey i just want to talk to you about how great this experience was were you actually working from home and he said yes we've been working from home during this pandemic and again it just shows you when you prioritize service and you put everything and all those pieces into place you can achieve big things and continue that service experience for your customers yeah that's a great story and uh i i particularly love the payoff of the story yeah exactly at the end of it we were able to get the tent working and running and they were they were happy kids well i think we're going to have to drew a camping adventure in my household too i love that story so you know i think as we keep going we reached the sort of the the top of this stack right that what we call beyond service stage and i think to me this really starts to reach into a lot of the things obviously we've been talking about but even what rob sort of introduced in the day here right so this is where you know as a service leader you're thinking now again about you know things beyond even service right because we as consumers don't necessarily give a darn about the organizational structure of the brands we're engaging with you know we don't think okay this is the marketing department oh now it's the service department oh maybe it's the sales of the commerce we just think of engaging with the brand right so you know i think this is the stage that if you have the opportunity to get here and do it really well this is where we can really see a big shift and we can talk about things like building truly long-term customer loyalty and you know not just to retain your customers actually known for a great brand that interacts well and use that as a means of attracting new customers to your brand as well so you know danette you're lucky to work with a lot of service leaders out there and so you know are there any you know sort of favorite customers good stories you could tell us about you know folks who are really getting it to the stage and how it's really impacting their business yeah you know we have a lot of companies that are in this area and starting to merge but payoneer is one of the companies that we're working with right now or that we're starting to work with and they are a borderless payment platform company for a borderless world they operate in over 200 companies in 150 different currencies with 70 different languages so you can imagine where everything can go wrong payoneer is doing everything right they're processing over 5 000 inquiries a day globally and the way that they're doing that and still delivering exceptional service is they found out a way to be regional and to be able to be super localized with the customers that they have but still do it over a broad scale globally and they do that by using digital automation with smart routing so they make sure that they have the right agent who's authentic to the right customer that's speaking the right language at the right time so again this is a great way of showing like all of those steps that we've talked about from inbound all the way up to advanced and having the right channels available and the right self-service experience this company is actually able to automate over 72 percent of their requests just handled through automated replies and that again allows their agents to be really authentic and have those genuine conversations of work of those harder incidents with their customers so this is a great example of how a company can go from inbound to beyond and be extremely successful for their customers yeah that's such a good story and that's what i mean it's funny you think back to the tent right this is your finances you can't say dang it broke and now you have to figure out what is the equivalent of dang it broke around all of the regions of the world with their you know not just languages but certain cultural context as well so i mean that's just amazing and i you know something i am really really impressed with so you know as we begin to wrap up our session here today i think i'd like to just kind of take a moment to remind the folks in the audience that you know this stuff is complicated it is complex and it is challenging as you fight through all your day-to-day priorities to figure out you know really what to do next right and frankly there's no one-size-fits-all answer every every individual out there running every different service department every person that's participating and trying to make service better for customers out there in the world is going to have their own set of unique challenges and so you know we built this framework just as a tool to help right a tool to really help you think about maybe assess your current capabilities you know understand where you might want to focus on next or you know what you're striving to be at that the next level so you know before we get to the end here again i love learning about our audience and so let's learn a little bit more and so i would challenge you all to think about that framework right think about you know as these ideas are laid out how do you feel that you yourself are placed do you think you're really early in in this maturity that you're sort of inbound or maybe foundational like i was back in the day do you think you've got some great stuff going maybe you're more an advancer or do you think of that you know service is not just a strategic capability but for you but for your entire organization and we're talking about as rob mentioned the consistencies of of all of the interactions being there for you is so that that top level of beyond well and thank you for that input i think it's not really shocking uh it is something we're all striving to be better at and that's why we've built this model in this tool and so you know i think that for as a next step for you all i'd certainly welcome you to reach out to us over this email address if you have any questions about this content um if you'd like to talk more if you'd like us to sit down with you and really walk through your own maturity and really how we can help you frame up a rough plan for what to do next and and really how you can keep advancing towards that ultimate goal of really that beyond you know beyond service so uh with that danette i'd really thank you for your time today it's been great seeing you online again uh thank you all in the audience uh for spending the time with us today it's really i hope personally this session has been helpful and useful and giving you some good things to take away and think about
