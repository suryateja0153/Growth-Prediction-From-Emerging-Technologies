 hello and welcome to this week's episode of the futuram tech webcast this is part of our interview series of conversations and it's all our conversation today is all about shining a light on collaboration and security um we're going to talk about trends in online collaboration and how a global pandemic has changed the way we work and the way we live and what that means as it relates to collaboration platforms and security my guest today is niraj gopal and he's with cisco webex new ridge is the director of product management for webex enterprise security and compliance basically the things that he owns as it relates to security and compliance the list is so long but i'm going to tell you a little bit about what he does and which is you know why i was so interested to have this conversation he owns the 360 degree approach to webex security which spans identity management end-to-end encryption data loss prevention the dpl casb partner ecosystem mobile device security third-party platform certifications and then security policy controls in what's called control hub as if that's not enough he's got 20 years of experience in enterprise enterprise software product management he's created a number of innovative products he holds seven patents by the way i have zero and he has a reputation for being a fanatic when it comes to solving customer problems so that last part is really why we are kindred spirits because i too am fanatic when it comes to solving customer problems so welcome it's so great to have you thank you shelley great to be here isn't the worst thing when somebody goes through your bio i i've you know stood on so many stages done so many interviews and every time it's just like uh how quickly can this be over so anyway i'm sorry but those things are all really important so i wanted to make sure our audience really knows how awesome you are so one of the things i want to talk about before we get into our conversation is that we have here at future research partnered with cisco on a couple of pieces of original research that has been recently released and we did two separate studies and we developed two separate papers one of them is called unified communications and collaboration where we looked at the essential differentiators for 2020 and beyond as it relates to collaboration platforms and then we looked at collaboration and communication platforms and the role that security and privacy and trust play and how important they are in the enterprise space so from our research you know one of the things that one of the key findings that and this is going to surprise nobody the demand for enterprise grade ucnc tools and services has never been greater 76 of the enterprises that we surveyed for our research said they expect to increase the use of collaboration tools in 2020 well no joke and 74 percent expect that increasing to continue on into 2021. in addition 61 of the enterprises that we spoke with said that they're expecting to spend more this year to keep employees partners and customers connected and collaborating and i think it's a fair assumption that that increase is going to continue on into 2021. so with that let's talk a little bit about trends you know what are the trends that you're seeing in online collaboration since the pandemic has changed the way that we work let's talk about that a little bit yeah absolutely like you mentioned you know 70 percent over 70 percent of the companies in the us and outside you know all of a sudden you know just went remote as soon as the pandemic hit right so many of these companies hadn't prepared for bulk of these workers to work remote right which means many of these back office employees processing let's say you know credit card reports mortgage application or a bank they didn't really have work laptops work machines so they didn't really have any software endpoint which will protect the data as these employees would start to work home right and these people would be working with partners outside and other other customers as well right collaboration so data loss prevention or enterprise compliance is really top of the mind for these companies right because you know this you're dealing with sensitive information right your customers pii you're dealing with you know intellectual property you're dealing with a whole bunch of you know sensitive information so that is a key kind of you know challenge concern that we hear from customers and the other one is more around you know you have some conversations which are sensitive meetings which are sensitive like like board meetings for example you know acquisition related conversations so now i mean you can't have that all in the you know within the four walls of a conference room right everything has to be removed so privacy and confidentiality of these meetings becoming very critical for some of the c-suite level conversation board meetings etc so these are the kind of like you know some of the key trends that we are seeing outside oh absolutely you know one of the things that surprised yet didn't surprise us when we were doing this research was that a lot of companies told us that the way they made decisions in in having to do such a rapid pivot because of the pandemic and all of a sudden employees moving out of the workplace into their homes regardless of what their work functions were in many instances what their policy was about collaboration platforms was simply use whatever use whatever you want we don't care we don't have time to think about it um we don't have time to worry about it and conversations around data and security really weren't happening because people were most in most instances people did not have a foundation for secure collaboration platforms and so it was just really interesting to us and again not surprising but interesting that you know the the companies that we spoke with largely just let people figure it out themselves and but i think that we've seen a shift in that you know from my own experience you know i know that my kids i have teenagers twin teenagers who were in eighth grade last year and almost all of their learning was done um using zoom and then this year their school has moved away from that collaboration platform largely reputational i know we'll talk about that later um but you know i think that so what we're seeing now i think is people being more mindful and more strategic as it relates to the decisions that they're making with regard to collaboration platforms because they know that they can't possibly continue on with the use whatever you want policy i mean it just doesn't make any sense certainly as it relates to company data customer data employee data i mean it makes no sense at all so one of the things again that you know from our research security is rapidly becoming the must-have of must-haves for anyone making decisions about what collaboration platforms to use and 96 percent of enterprises that we spoke with said that it's important that they trust their technology and services prevent providers well of course that's a no-brainer you know another 83 percent of our respondents said that they only trust vendors and providers who are proactive and transparent as it relates to security threats and security issues and threats to user data but you know that said there are still instances of um you know there are still instances of security breaches so let's talk a little bit about um meeting bombing or you know what let's just go ahead and call it zoom bombing um aren't you so glad that there's not a term that says webex bombing i mean like that would just be to me to be zoomed to be dealing with the fact that this is just sort of a common phrase in our vernacular these days would be a horrible thing but i i personally believe that they kind of earned that in the sense that i think it's a company that really didn't make security foundational when they were building their product and you know they did a lot of things right but i don't think that you can build without security first so so there there aren't breaches in the news as it relates to the webex product um so tell us what you and your team have done to make sure that doesn't happen yeah and neutrally yeah so you know bombing of meetings is really bad especially for the attendees who are participating and you know loss of data that happens out of that and like you mentioned you know security is foundational in redux anything that we design or build before even we write a line of code we you know keep security in mind we do threat modeling think about the various scenarios this new work new feature new capability we're working on how could this be attacked from outside and then we bridge those gaps and plug those holes and then we build the capabilities there's a big security baseline so all of these capabilities are you know built in and then we have certain things which are on by default for example all meetings will have password turned on by default which means nobody from outside cannot just join in right because they need to know the password and then you know there are several other controls that we have turned on by default and you know we allow people to set up authentication so no guests can join in every meeting gets locked after a few minutes of start and only the host will have to let you in essentially that's another security capability and uh you know these capabilities and any external candidates external participant from your organization they are automatically placed in the lobby so they don't just barge into the meeting essentially your host will look into that and then has to admit those external unauthenticated guests to the meetings and then we have you know hundreds of controls within the platform which allow you to customize the security to your risk profile right every company is different right i mean somebody in a tech company gaming company is gonna have a vastly different profile than somebody who's a bank or an insurance or a medical provider for example so we allow users to customize the deployment we give them the full set of controls essentially and you know this is how essentially we avoid all of these you know bombings of the meetings and security well i think that's pretty important i've never had a meeting be bombed and i hope not to i think it would be you know and the thing too that i think is interesting is that a lot of instances of this happening are you know they don't happen when people like you and i who are tech savvy users who are thinking about things like that and it's not because you know we're necessarily smarter or better than anybody else although we do use different platforms of course but you know it's school room classes it's public meetings it's people who don't really understand tech you know our team and i'm sure yours as well we we are 100 virtual and have been for a decade or more you know we're pros at communicating virtually and using collaboration platforms so we understand the nuances and unfortunately some of these instances have happened when people really aren't and you know that's really where it can be a huge issue exactly and all these settings enabled by default really protect [Music] yeah so i don't have to think about protecting myself it's built in it's foundational so let's talk about you know let's talk about so of course users can can protect their own data and we talked a little bit about that but what about it security admins you know of course they have a big role in making sure that data doesn't get breached and so what can and should vendors do to help protect against data breaches or or actually let me also let me ask it this way if you're in it and you're trying to make a decision as to you know um what security what collaboration platform rather you want to use and that sort of you want to recommend using you know what is it that you should look for um when you're evaluating what the offerings are and what the different you know the key differentiators and platforms are what should what should it people look for yeah absolutely like i mentioned i mean you know the trends the key trend we see is data loss prevention right so these collaboration tools you know a lot of sensitive data gets shared between the employees whether that is you know your intellectual property your you know acquisition plans your three-year strategy and product definition blueprints all of that information gets shared so you don't want that information to leak out essentially right and you want to make sure right set of information is shared between the right set of individuals whether within the company or outside so i would say you know i.t organizations should definitely focus on the dlp capabilities and especially as collaboration tools are moved to the cloud like any other for you know agility performance and other reasons right so the new category of dlp tools has emerged in the marketplace which is essentially casb tools cloud access security brokers so you need to make sure that you have deployed those tools to protect other applications within your enterprise right whether that is you know office 365 productivity suite whether you know that is your enterprise file sharing platform like box and others right dropbox etc you want the same policies and the same tools to protect your collaboration tools as well right so that is going to be a key thing so basically all of these any tool that you're settling on make sure it can work with your existing dlp cache b2s because integration and bringing into a new tool just to protect your application is going to be super expensive very difficult to manage especially in this day and age when you know it has to do more with less essentially right right i think the key here is that you don't want a more complicated technology stack you want the right technology solutions to begin with i mean that's what i we look at and write about and and do research on you know i mean the technology stack landscape is incredibly cloud crowded and clouded that was you know an unintentional pun um but i think that's the key is that you want it to be simple you want it to be strategic you want it to make sense and so when you're looking at things from that strategic overview and trying to make decisions on what to use i think solutions that aren't just one more thing that we can plug in makes a lot of sense and i hadn't thought about that before these tools need to be essentially open right i mean they can be a closed ecosystem i only work with you know this partner if you want to protect data then you have to deploy that it should be open and right guys and work with the ecosystem that you got in your enterprise well and i think that you know obviously they need to be these solutions need to be secure they need to be cloud-based they need to be easy to use and and i think that you can you can get all those things there you know the right solution offers all of those things so let's let's talk a little bit about work from home you're working from home i'm working from home um you know since most employees are working from home on mobile and many of them are using their devices what what should it admins do to as it relates to the security and the safety of those devices what do they need to be thinking about indeed i mean that is a you know another critical item especially right because since you're not using a corporate device it doesn't have the endpoint security software and the whole stack that you use to protect your in office desktops and office machines now people are just using their home ipad their you know personal machines and all that stuff so you need to make sure and especially with mobile devices it's a big challenge you need to make sure that the vendor provides their own built-in mobile application management capabilities some of the capabilities you know that we enable within the webex as an example is you know even if you don't have any mdm or a security endpoint software we still have controls within our admin console control hub to say you know application wouldn't even launch until you configure a pin lock which means if you lose your device or somebody steals it unless they know the pin code they can't access your application right and some other capabilities would be needed required and personal is uh you know if your device gets stolen then somebody may get access to it and then all the cached messages all the the messages are still going to that device right so you need a capability to remotely wipe and clear that device and force log out that user if there is a theft or a you know issue like that so webex control hub you know enables you to do that none of your other data photographs calendar invites everything else stays exactly the same all of these things are just built into the application for example you want to disable files right mobile especially is a big challenge screenshot people can so it's not as secure as a you know desktop is so having these controls around sharing of files on mobile controlling it i think those are critical set of things that a application should have and then we built those in the webex from the beginning actually yeah i think that's really important so so then going on on the point of protecting users a lot of times um we did uh we did some recent research with another client on dashboards i'm kind of throwing this to you out of the blue here but you know visibility and control of what's happening within the ecosystem is super important and you know what our research showed us in this particular project that we just did was that you know a lot of times companies think that they're good that they're protected and everything else and and it's largely companies who don't have a dashboard kind of view into the whole ecosystem that feel like they're safe whereas people who are able to you know use a hub that shows them accessibility that shows them the whole ecosystem realize that you know threat detection and i mean there are threats coming at us all day every day in the enterprise and so talk to me a little bit just about you know visibility and control and how important it is as it relates to collaboration platforms and maybe what you know people need to think about as it relates to that in the area so you know i.t administrators compliance officers the legal teams essentially they do need a visibility into the content their employees are sharing within the organization you don't want to block anybody all any employee but then you still want to see what they're doing and if you there some violation you want to note it down inform that that you just violated a policy you know all of those capabilities are definitely required and webex has built-in capabilities we have you know a public api events api which gives you visibility outside into any tool that you want and that visibility initially the critical thing is the important thing is that it gives you visibility even when you are talking with external organizations tool or capability your product outside has this level of control for example if you and i are talking in a conversation planning this interview as an example and then i share some content cisco id will have full control and visibility into what i'm sharing and my policy would apply even if you own the conversation so this is really you know sort of uh super critical control that cisco has essentially or any it organization has it's kind of like contact tracing as it relates to as it relates to fighting a global pandemic you know that contact raising has proven to be pretty valuable um maybe not in the u.s since we don't really do very much of it but in other countries um but this is kind of a form of data tracing you know whether i originate the conversation you originate the conversation and just being able to keep sort of a handle on what it is that's shared i think that's i i didn't know that and i think that's really interesting yeah that's a good analogy actually and your organization has full control over whatever matters most to you my organization has control over you know what is important to me so i think i mean that that is best of both worlds essentially right but without violating any policies yeah i agree i think that's super important so let's talk about end-to-end encryption and how that safeguards meetings i don't think a lot of people really understand the you know the role that erie plays so talk to us a little bit about that yeah absolutely yeah and to an encryption really you know addresses one of the major trends that i mentioned regarding the private and confidential meetings so a lot of your conversations like i mentioned c-suite board-level meetings which are remote essentially intellectual property and a whole bunch of other conversations you want it to be fully private safe in such a way that even the provider cisco as a provider or any other you know collaboration vendor that you're using they don't have access to that conversation because it is super secret and critical to you so end-to-end encryption provides that capability so what happens in that case is the host when it join they are the one which create a key which would be used by all the participants for that meeting and even cisco as a provider would not have access to key so all the bits you know the streams the media would come through our cloud but it is all encrypted and nobody has any sort of clue what's going on in there and cisco cannot even you know break into and see into that so that provides really full confidentiality for for sensitive conversations and we've been doing that for 10 plus years you know shelley we have really perfected it so it provides full controls down to the individual meeting so within your company you can enable it for everybody or you can enable it for select employees for example c-suite and there is no additional charge for that so you want to roll it out to everybody you could and you know down to the individual medium for example for this conversation we can choose that i'm going to have an end-to-end conversation enter into an encrypted but some other meeting you know picnic planning or you know off-site planning or something which is not critical i can just have as a regular meeting so so this is you know very important and it scales really well hundreds of you know attendees can participate in a in a conversation and they don't know anything except that this conversation is fully private yeah i think that's awesome you know one of the things that our research for these couple of different reports showed us is that there's an increasing gap between the top tier and the second tier vendors in this space and the perceived level of sort of security consciousness by by enterprise professionals um you know it is zoom continues to regardless of how it iterates and how you know the messaging that zoom uses about you know security and things like that i think the company has definitely in the enterprise space taken a hit as it relates to in the enterprise space in the educational space in lots and lots of areas because people are just concerned and they're my daughter works for um an enterprise insurance company and they were you know 100 banned from using the platform so it's it's hard to walk away from a reputational hit that's associated with the data breach and i think that you know as it relates to security um there there it is only there are only really a couple of collaboration platforms who are top tier as it relates to security and encryption and data protection and all compliance and all of those things and and cisco webex is at the top of the list and that's one of the reasons we're having this conversation um you know one of the things i wanted to talk about i wanted to move away from just the workplace in general and touched briefly on the healthcare space and you know more and more people are using telehealth to deliver more and more companies are using telehealth to deliver and take care of patients and more and more people are availing themselves of this so when it comes to making health care secure talk with us a little bit about what you and your team at webex are doing to facilitate this india socially all of the capabilities that i mentioned making the platform secure these are foundational apply to every vertical but healthcare is especially special it's very regulated as you know right patient health information you know but the private information shouldn't be shared with anybody outside we are obviously hipaa compliant we share sign ba and all the good stuff but we really shine is like two places right one is there is a third-party audit hip-hop today is really self-audited essentially right there is no third party is auditing it right but we have a certification called hydros it is one of the most rigorous certifications it took us two years and hundreds of you know person months to get the certification but it certifies webex teams as a platform certified for use of personal patient health information no other collaboration vendor in the industry has that certification so you have an exposure over there if you go with somebody else whereas we are fully certified we can share the reports with with the customer so a lot of you know confidence you get with that and the second thing that we have is the add-on in terms of the dlp capabilities so we have events api and we have extended the dlp capability to meetings as well and we work obviously with open partners ecosystem we work with essentially all the leading cas bdlp provider compliance tools that you have but we also have a built-in uh you know cisco dlp packaged as part of webex what that does is it has you know built in uh healthcare related policies you just go to that tool enable that in your use of webex teams at vivx teams as a platformer webex as a platform is obviously high trust and hipaa certified but what you type in it is also going to be hipaa certified because of that add-on that we have within the tool and that is really unique because there's no other collaboration vendor out there with their own dlp casb capabilities right well that's awesome that makes me feel a lot better when i'm communicating with my doctors in telehealth visits and you know there's no sign that that's slowing down anytime soon you know i'd love to wrap up our conversation and just talk a little bit about what's next what do you think is next on the roadmap for collaboration security what do you see that you know what do you see that's ahead what are you working on that you can talk about that's interesting what do you think people customers in the enterprise care the most about lay it on me yeah indeed yeah so a lot of you're investing a lot in security compliance and these capabilities so this month you know we have something called space classification capability it is a start of a data classification capabilities that we're going to be building in the platform so starting now you can tag your conversations as secret or you can tag them as public or confidential depending upon your organization's you know data tier levels essentially fully customizable and then based on that you could your employees are aware as to what they should be sharing with that conversation because they'll be prompted every time that you know this is a secret conversation don't bring in outside users so on so forth and it would integrate with third-party tools the casb tools so they could enforce differentiated policies secret if somebody tries to even add a third party external user they will be ejected as an example and they can only share the right type of conversation ethical walls is another capability which is very important in financial vertical all the banks you know traders cannot talk to as an example the research staff right there is a because of conflict of interest and finra and other regulation so that capability is native and built into control hub is you know going to be out pretty soon essentially legal vertical also also benefits from that meetings dlp capabilities which i briefly talked about they are going to be available now which means any conversation that we are recording you know we're going to look at the transcription of that what was mentioned and spoken in that meeting and the third-party tools will apply policies on that if for example i you know share some you know social security number whereas my policy is not to share that it would be flag it will tell you at minute eight neeraj violated this policy so which is you know unique in the industry no but nobody nobody does does that and we are releasing it as we speak essentially and there are several other capabilities we're going to be you know obviously working with our security business unit getting more you know additional capabilities driving the best of cisco cisco enabling more you know personal device securing the personal device even if it doesn't have any uh you know corporate managed endpoint on that so a lot of exciting capabilities yeah that is really exciting and i do love that i mean i love the prompts that tell you you know when something is wrong or alert you to hey dummy you can't do that or whatever that's that's layperson speak no i think that's really cool and that's really exciting look look ahead so nirish this has just been so interesting thank you so much for hanging out with me um what i want to remind our listeners that in the show notes for this episode i will include links to each one of these research papers unified communications and collaboration the essential differentiators for 2020 and beyond which is you know information that i think you'll want to take a look at as you're evaluating your collaboration platforms and secondly unified communications and collaboration and a deep look at the primacy of security privacy and trust and really i think that you'll agree that if you make time to download and read this you'll see there's some really eye-opening data in there about what's happening across this landscape and and the role that that privacy and security and trust and and compliance and all those things are playing so so we set out to create some really um valuable resources for you and i think you'll agree if you if you get a chance to download those so thank you very much for spending time with me today i always appreciate hearing from really smart people and you definitely are one of those and we'll talk again soon absolutely thank you it was nice talking to you
