 [Music] [Music] Good day to you all and welcome to our factory in Visano Italy my name is Javier Lanfranchi and this is Faccin Group product presentation [Music] Faccin Group with more than 30 000 machines installed around the world and offering three great brands Faccin Boldrini and Roundo is a leader in the design, manufacturing and commercialization of the widest range of plate rolls angle rolls dished head lines and special machines [Music] One of the most important applications of modern plate rolls nowadays is for sure the wind power industry. In fact plate rolls are intensively used for rolling heavy plates for several types of steel structures like wind towers or offshore foundations like monopiles tripods or jackets. We at Faccin believe in the green industry and in the growth of this sector so years ago we have decided to create a wind tower division, a team of people dedicated to study the market needs improve the products and help our customers to increase productivity and quality of their products for the wind industry Faccin specialized in designing and producing fully automated wind tower lines with four rolls machines with automation, heavy duty machines for foundations, dedicated machines for making wind towers door frames and profile bending machines for making flanges through cold or hot bending. Today we will present to you an example of our wind tower line consisting of our plate roll model 4HEP S360 with wind tower automation package we will be showing today this machine before it is shipped to our Spanish customer one of the biggest wind tower manufacturers in the world [Music] so here we are in front of the wind tower line ready to start rolling wind tower cans but let us have a closer look at a wind tower line and how it is made. Well first of all the heart of a wind tower line is the plate roll. In this case we are in front of a 4 rolls machine model 4HEP with capacity of 3 meters by 85 millimeters in pre-bending nowadays it is a very popular machine size for bending a wide range of wind tower sections Since the wind tower lines are designed to intensively bend heavy duty steel plates on multiple production shifts the machine structure strength and rigidity is a crucial point that is important to consider during the selection of a new wind tower line. The 4HEP model in front of us is a four rolls machine with planetary swinging arms design and featuring: a heavy duty base frame made by three huge fabricated structures that make sure that the machine body absorbs the complete load without the need of getting its strength from the foundations two heavy side frames connected by four columns two for each side of the machine columns are needed to create a closed loop structure and counterbalance the natural frame solicitation during bending and prevent structural deformation you understand that these two points are fundamental to guarantee an extreme accuracy on the final rolled products planetary swinging arms for the sidewall movements fixed to the side frame with innovative HFS system that reduces the transversal stress on the side cylinder rams by having a different connection point to the frame compared to the other rolling machines on the market another important structural part is the large drop end typical from Faccin designed to perfectly compensate the horizontal and vertical loads coming during the bending operation another appreciated feature of all the Faccin 4 rolls machines is for sure the design of the transmission, in fact as you can see the motors and gearboxes are coupled with the rolls through a transition piece that is protecting the rolls and gearboxes to ensure the maximum reliability and last but not least we believe that a good structure is not enough to keep the precision for many years for this reason we always install a centralized lubrication system on our machines as we said the machine structure is very important but in a modern plate roll also the quality of the hydraulic and electronic systems are fundamental. Together with our customers we understood how important it is to have a quick and precise rolls balancing system that is why since the 80s we implement the EBS that stands for Electronic Balancing System on all our machines. The rolls power must be 100 percent under the operator's control that is why we have fast simultaneous movements with micro positioning for perfect repeatability and high productivity obviously the complete hydraulic system is equipped with an efficient cooling system air cooling or water cooling according to the environmental conditions well there is a lot to say about the plate rolls but the best is yet to come in fact a big added value of a wind tower line is for sure the handling equipment of the wind tower package a number of options designed with the target of maximizing the productivity so let us have a look to the classic configuration of a wind tower package the first basic activity of an operator when bending plates is for sure to enter the plate correctly in the rolling machine for this we have designed and delivered a number of motorized feeding tables of any length and capable of handling the heaviest and longest plates the feed tables are available in two versions the standard horizontal and the special tilting type that accompanies the plate during the first pre-bending operation any feeding table should be equipped with an efficient alignment system very important to pre-align the plate before feeding without the need of using the overhead crane furthermore the alignment system becomes fundamental to realign cones during the rolling process and obviously all these axis are CNC controlled the side support on the exit side of the machine is fundamental to support the plate directly after bending to avoid it falls down due to its own weight the top support heavy duty and tiltable to perfectly support cones and cans is fully integrated in the wind tower line to contrast the effect of gravity on the semi-rolled wind tower section the second side support in this case with clamping system on board is used for both supporting the plate but also for aligning the plate edges for the tack welding. An old advertisement said power is nothing without control and it's true for this reason our R&D department is constantly developing this CNC with advanced and dedicated functions for wind towers manufacturers look how easy it is to create an automatic program for rolling a wind tower section we select the wind tower option then select the section to be rolled and define the technical parameters such as width thickness, diameters, yield point at this point the wind tower line has calculated all the movements for the bending machine and the complete handling equipment but the CNC is not only automatic bending in fact the PGS Ultra includes machine maintenance program, machine diagnostic import of CAD drawings industry 4.0 integration for production monitoring advanced teleservice for minimum downtime and fast assistance from the Faccin service department as a conclusion to win in the competitive wind towers manufacturing market customers need the best rolling equipment to meet the highest performances in terms of production speed a wind tower section must be rolled in 15-20 minutes including the tack welding, accuracy to increase productivity the re-rolling percentage must be minimum, automation a single man operation with a CNC handling all the axis easy handling powerful tools as supports, tables, etc to make the operation easier for the operator reliability a machine should be designed for intensive working for more than 20 years so what you need is definitely the Faccin Wind Tower automation system so we have arrived at the end of this product presentation we really hope that you have found it useful if you did like or comment this video and subscribe to our channel so you can receive our latest news in product development we thank you very much for your time and if you would like to know more about our products our solutions and how we can help you grow your business do not hesitate to contact any of us see you on the next one ciao
