 [Music] good morning good afternoon and good evening on wherever you are joining us today for the salesforce release readiness live developer preview where i'm currently broadcasting from my study slash library here in colorado my name is heather dykstra i'm on the developer relations team a team dedicated to your success as a developer i'm joined today by a group of product experts that are going to break down all the great things that are new in the summer 20 release now we've changed our format a tiny bit today to accommodate the streaming from our homes and to ensure a seamless show for all of you so instead of doing q a throughout the show we're going to hold all of that until the end you'll still get to hear about the latest updates from each one of our speakers just after each other and then we'll go to the q a so it's more important than ever for you to take note of your questions while you're watching the demos so that we can get all of those at the end of the show please make sure you use the hashtag salesforce live and post at salesforcedubs to get your questions answered we do ask that you post those meaty questions you have in the trailblazer community where we can get you a more thorough answer now before i get started i did want to look briefly at the forward-looking statement please make sure you make any and all purchasing decisions based on what's currently available on the platform and not any forward-looking statements that myself or any of my wonderful panelists here today may make we shouldn't have this problem today but we are talking with some pms and you know that they love to give us those road map sneak peeks so just keep that in mind as you watch all the demos today so what are we actually going to be talking about well i'm really excited because we're going to kick things off with zineb who's going to tell us all about what's new with einstein platform then we'll transition and talk a little bit with karuppa about lightning message service and the salesforce lightning design system plug-in for sketch then we'll go over to karen who's going to tell us what's new with salesforce developer tools and we'll wrap everything up with courtney who's going to give us the deep dive on salesforce private connect so to share even more about some of those initial announcements let's hand it all over to zinedine on einstein platform hi from lovely san francisco my name is zina blacky i also go by z and i lead the einstein vision and language team and i'm really excited today to walk you through all the new updates and products we have made available for you so let's go ahead and get started for this session we're going to talk about einstein language and vision i will share with you some of what the salesforce ai research team has been working on how this feeds into the services available to you highlighting not only what's new but also how internal teams are and how you can leverage these services directly before i tell you more about these services and what you can do with them let me provide you some background about my team half my team is the salesforce ai research team which are writing papers and talking at conferences to advance the state of the art in ai and the rest of my team data science and engineering and applied research works on leveraging these latest breakthroughs to drive value to our customers and really work to close the gap to getting the latest in ai to you as fast as possible today two of the areas we are researching and developing state-of-the-art artificial intelligence models for are language and vision and of course ethics is always core to what we do for natural language processing we divide the way humans understand into multiple tasks each of which attempt to replicate a small part of what human language experiences these tasks include question and answering sentiment analysis summarization and many others as you can see here the salesforce research team is committed to advancing nlp for researching nlp tasks such as these and developing state-of-the-art models for example one of the salesforce research papers accepted at iclr 2019 proposed a new question and answering nlp model that pulls data from multiple data sources using a unique coarse grained fine grain approach to find the correct answer and improve performance this research has led to new state-of-the-art performance results in the question and answering nlp task we've also developed a multi-task question and answering network model that combines the top 10 nlp tests into one model this model is able to adapt to slight variations in questions and tasks and to new domains and it can learn new tasks without specific training which is also called zero shot learning and with this we have products that we have made available to you today in the einstein language family first we have einstein sentiment that given a piece of text will tell you if the piece of text is positive negative or neutral an einstein intent which lets you define the categories and given a piece of text will tell you which category it belongs to these services have been available for a while now but we're continually improving and making updates and for the summer release not only have we improved the underlying model to have a better general understanding of language we've also made intent available in all the languages listed here the last three are in beta though we now have also provided ood or out of domain which is just an other category out of the box so you don't really need to train to be able to leverage this the same einstein language services available to you is what our internal salesforce team uses for example the einstein bots team from service cloud and the email insights team for marketing cloud are using the same nlp that we've just shown you we also have customers like you that are using these services directly for case routing or survey analysis so now let's go ahead and switch gears a little bit and talk about fission our salesforce ai research team is also working on advancing computer vision for example we have been working on visual description this allows you to provide an image and will generate a natural language description of the image so you can see here in this example where the model is focusing to generate words such as little girl or umbrella another example is visual question and answering where you provide the model an image and a question and it will respond based on the image and you can see here when you provide the model this image and ask it what color are the bananas it doesn't just answer yellow as you would generally expect but instead you can see it focusing in the image on what it has identified as bananas and is able to answer the correct answer which is green and finally we have visual object detection where we won first place in one of the biggest object detection competitions this then all feeds into the products we have available for you in the unsigned vision family we have image classification that allows you to define categories and given an image will tell you which category it belongs to we have einstein object detection that allows you to identify objects or products within an image and can give you relative positioning in size so you can do cool things such as counts and finally the latest addition to the family is ocr or optical character recognition ocr is going ga this summer and we have baked in it some awesome functionality not only are you able to digitize the text in the image you can also use this service to identify the associated entity is it a name date organization etc we also have ocr available for tables and even when not all the lines are visible like you can see in this table here or receipts our model is able to infer those lines once again the same computer vision that our internal sales force teams are using is available to you for example our marketing cloud social studios team uses image classification to analyze twitter images our consumer good cloud has a retail execution application that uses object detection to recognize products on shelf and we have customers using einstein vision directly to identify products or product parts or even for diagnostics so let me walk you through an example application that leverages einstein vision as businesses and communities of all size a picture of an id like a driver's license built on salesforce einstein ocr provides businesses a solution to automate data entry in situations such as drive through testing centers or location entry check-ins this helps avoid direct physical contact with individuals for this demo let's imagine i'm a receptionist at the salesforce office in chicago as a safety measure salesforce mandates id verification for visitors in order to minimize exposure and safely reopen the office instead of visitors handing me their id i'll be able to open the salesforce mobile application and launch the check-in app and select the sales office we're in i can then take a picture using the mobile device without physically handling the visitor's id in the back end a rest api call is made to process the image first we use image classification where einstein identifies that this is a california driver's license and then we use einstein ocr to identify the text on the driver's license and we can use that to pre-populate the fields not only do i benefit from not having to physically handle the id einstein ocr reduces the hurdles of manual data entry the time i would typically spend on entering data into each field is significantly reduced thanks to einstein ocr in the back end an apex class does a quick search to identify if a visitor's record exists if a record isn't found this app allows me to create a new visitor record i now have the option to complete the check-in process by entering the dates some notes and other details important to my business in addition to allowing me to quickly check in visitors ocr enables businesses to store this data for contact tracing and help communication with those potentially exposed to infectious diseases so that they can take the right actions to minimize spread a quick survey which was created using a flow template pops up on the screen for the visitor to complete the best part about using lightning flows is that it's a powerful tool that enables you to implement business automation with little code and uses the results from the einstein ocr rest api callouts just to wrap things up einstein ocr is another tool that can allow businesses to adapt to the new normal as employees return back to work safely every business leader is prioritizing the health of their employees as they are slowly moving back to shared work environments ocr capabilities allows companies to easily capture data save time and provide a data trail and prevent physical contact to close things off we're going to do a bit of a different road map instead of telling you what's coming next i'll mention some of the pilots that will give you insights as to what's coming next and you can simply ask your aes to nominate you if you're interested in any of these pilots the first one is data augmentation which we have available for both vision and language which allows you to train models with less data the second pilot we have is business card scanner that allows you to create contacts with just a picture of a business card and finally we have einstein form reader that will allow you to digitize any form into a salesforce record from a passport w2 to patient referrals and invoices we are excited to see how you use einstein vision and language to build intelligent apps if you haven't yet you can sign up for free on einstein dot ai products and you can find the documentation there as well if you prefer to use clicks instead of code simply install from app exchange the einstein vision and language model builder and everyone gets 2 000 free predictions a month and so with that i'm excited to hand it over to kurupa to walk us through lightning message services hi everybody my name is kripa chanatambi i'm the product manager for slds also known as the lightning design system this is the team that is the heart and soul of the user interface that you build on the salesforce platform today i'm really excited to talk about two really cool features we'll be releasing very soon the first one is lightning message service the second feature is the slds plugin for sketch this will be a fun session so let's go ahead and get started we'll start with the first of our two features lightning message service what we have is a typical salesforce page displaying a handful of components that we see on screen some of these components are displaying text some of them are displaying some images others are more interactive like the image carousel or the map control that allows you to perform common map operations on the bottom left we have the utility bar with the component and this component can be viewed inline can be docked or undocked or we can also drag and drop it into all sorts of interesting arrangements the part i want us to focus on is this unless we built our application recently using latest technologies there's a very good chance you have component investments built over several years made up of a combination of technologies you may have some visual force components you may have some aura components some of your more recent components might be a lightning web component aka and lwc a few of your components may be completely custom both using your own technology or framework of choice there's a lot of variety that goes on your page especially for one that you have been maintaining for quite some time independent of what technologies your components are built in you will want to communicate between them historically this wasn't a simple problem to solve each ui technology had its own approach for communicating and depending on the components you're communicating between you had to choose a particular approach this approach would vary it could be aura event could be a pub sub wrapper or module and a variety of other options it could also be something completely custom some combination of components such as any utility bar simply don't communicate well using any of our built-in approaches a lot of the heavy lifting fell on us to really handle the communication and ensure we're getting the right level of data in a performant way when we have a complex page whose ui components are composed of different tech layers there really has not been a unified approach for communicating between the components at least not until now to address this we would like to introduce the lightning message service lightning message service or lms for short is a native cliented communication framework in lightning experience lms abstracts away the messy details and provides a simplified messaging api that works seamlessly independent of whether components based on aura visual force or lwc it is technology agnostic in allowing you to communicate between the parts of our page earlier we saw the screen highlighting the various communication approaches that a typical page might need using lms this problem is greatly simplified with lightning method service the variety of approaches we saw earlier can be greatly simplified into just one approach the only exception here is lwc for communication between lwc's within the same dom subtree for example the approach we recommend is to just use standard dom events this is partly for performance where adding an extra layer for communication isn't really necessary when the browser handles it natively for us for all other combination of communication sources and targets lms is the technology you want to go with if we had to summarize the three big features lms brings a table it is it allows you to communicate across the salesforce ui technologies visualforce aura and lwc it also allows you to communicate across different sub trees in the dom a complex problem that really exists because of the types of uis we typically tend to build lastly lms allows us to communicate across windows such as when we try to communicate from a component in our utility bar and any part of our page so we talked a lot about all the cool things lms does but the best way to drive home the power and flexibility lms brings the table is through a demo i want to show you a quick demo of lms in action what we have here is a simple app that has a handful of components a component built in visual force a component built in aura and a component built in lwc what these components do is that they either send a message or listen for a message and what this demo is highlighting is that we're using lms behind the scenes to make all this communication much easier than it was in the past so i want to call out the utility bar that's also an lwc what i'm going to do now is highlight what we're doing and make them all subscribers to a particular message the pop-up and utility bar is going to be a listener for the events the visualforce component will be a listener and the lwc will be listener as well the aura component though will be the one that will be sending a message i'm going to type in the word hello and the message will be something basic like this is a message if everything worked out correctly when i click on the send message button all the listeners will get notified the body of this message will get displayed let me go ahead and click on send message notice that our lwc sees a message similarly at visual force component sees the same message the lwc that is for the utility bar gets the same behavior as well the message is also displayed so what used to be a challenging task in the past is now much easier thanks to lms what this really quick demo highlights is that elements is an action but the real fun stuff is in the code itself if you want to check out how the example works and how the communication across the components was actually implemented this link will take you to the source it was built by tian kruger our awesome pm for lms who helped make this feature possible we're going to shift gears a bit and move away from code and towards tools i want to talk to you about something new we're shipping called the slds plugin for sketch first let me provide some context many of you are probably familiar with slds or the lightning design system we provide you with the necessary guidelines html css design tokens icons and a variety of other resources to help you build great uis on the salesforce platform the goal of slds is to play a key role across all stages of the software development lifecycle which have broadly broken up into three stages ideation design and engineering for the slds plugins for sketch we're going to focus on the ideation part the part where we try to identify what we want to build and explore various paths forward a big part of ideation especially the visual layer is prototyping some ui and validating it historically this was a process that required writing code and this needed someone really technical to properly pull off this meant that the large number of roles that can help in the ideation phase were often left out from being truly productive what if we had a better solution what if we could provide a pixel perfect no code approach for prototyping our ui ideas what if we could do this by extending an industry standard design tool the tool we're extending is sketch sketch is a hugely popular and easy to use graphics editor that provides a variety of design capabilities to help us create prototypes file designs and everything in between think of it as the modern day photoshop for designing user interfaces the slds plugin for sketch combines the graphics capabilities of sketch with the full assortment of ui elements and visual content found in slds to us to quickly build salesforce uis with ease now all the sketches for designers we thoughtfully designed the slds plugin for sketch to be useful for a wide range of users with different sets of skills and interests as you'll see shortly our simple drag and drop approach for constructing salesforce uis combines the ease of pencil and paper with the richness of a high fidelity experience so the best way to learn about all the cool things a plugin does is to see it in action let's go ahead and take a look at our demo for our demo we're going to take this opportunities page a very common page you might have seen many times and explore a different way of visualizing some of the information here more specifically we want a different way of visualizing the leads information on the right hand side the way we're going to do this is by using a sketch plugin and get a mock-up we can easily share with our stakeholders i'm now in sketch and i have a new artboard that i've currently created we can bring up the slia sketch plugin in one of two ways one way is by using the keyboard and pressing command plus j another way is by going to plugins and selecting the slds plugin for sketch entry in a few moments we'll see the sketch window appear i'm going to move it to the right of the sketch window so that i can see our design the plugin and i can work between them very easily looking at the plugin the three parts of the plugin ui we'll be spending a lot of our time in the first the search bar where you can search for what exactly we're looking for the second is a list of all the various ui libraries that we can filter into by default all libraries selected if we're looking for something particular we can filter into any particular library the list of libraries we see is based on the ones we selected during the first run of the slds plugin for sketch you can always go back to manage libraries and decide which libraries you'd like to add or remove depending on what you're trying to create now depending on what library you have selected the contents of the selected library appear in the main body of the plugin where you can see all the various visual elements that appear we'll see more of the various parts of the plugin in action as part of building our visualization let's go ahead and start building a particular page to build our page we have multiple paths we can take in one path we can take a screenshot of the opportunities page paste it into sketch and add the elements we're going to visualize another approach is one where we create the ui from the ground up starting from the more common elements for example in an opportunities page or any salesforce page for that matter we know there'll be a global header the global icon and we know the page is going to have a very distinctive background which is blue brand band because the early parts of building a page are going to be very common and also very repetitive to save some time we have a standard artboards ui library when the items we provide the starting point we can drag and drop without having to go through and place the individual ui elements i'm going to drop this in and resize our artboard to ensure we can fully fit the contents and see all the common ui elements we will see in a typical salesforce page with the task of adding these boilerplate elements up we can focus more on adding the ui elements that will be specific to what we want to create one of the things we know that our opportunities page will have is a sub header a record sub header to be more precise but i'm going to search for just header because i don't know the exact name for it when we search for header we can see the base object home and the record home header though is the one we want i'm going to add it to our page and place it here very quickly we get a high fidelity look that is similar to what we'll see in the browser you can also see that when we resize the header the buttons on the right adjust and align properly pretty neat right so we have our page header next i want to further add additional sections to the page that are more generic the way we can do that is by using cards which are great elements to segment the parts of our page into so let me search for that i'm going to add a card that spans the full width of our page to house our path component i'm going to add two more cards to house our list of data and one more card that will eventually show our leads related information for the leads information it turns out we have a card variant that has a header and an icon as well i'm going to add that one to the page instead now i could start with a blank card and add this additional information the icon the text myself but because we provide you with a variant we can just go with that instead now instead of building out every piece of ui and making sure everything's pixel perfect which i encourage you to do as part of mimicking the final ui as much as possible i'm going to move to a more final version of just these components to save us some time where everything is properly spaced and aligned next let's go ahead and add the path component we know it's a big part of our ui i'm going to search for sales path there are a handful of variations but the default one is good i'm going to go ahead place it in the center of this card and left align it and resize it as shown so from here we can now add the data we want to display all the base components can be added and the data table seems like the right component to use to display all this data when searching for data table we get a bunch of results the advanced form of data table seems appropriate we can place it and resize it be mostly flush against the edges of our card so it looks nice we can also add the individual rows of data by dragging and dropping it in now i don't want to spend too much time showing you that part of it we're going to jump right on and see our data table is near final form now all that remains is to add the visualization to better identify the leads that we want i'm going to the charts ui library and this chart here looks appropriate for we're trying to do we know three categories are email call and text let me zoom in a bit to make it easier to see what's happening to represent this text information differently i'm going to icons and add an email icon and add it here i'm also going to need an icon for call and we can add a phone icon to make that happen for text we can choose messaging type of icon and this quick text icon looks appropriate now we can continue to build this out and what we'll get is this final version that we can show our stakeholders and receive feedback this was a whirlwind tour of many things you can do with the slds plugin for sketch to get started make sure you have sketch installed note that today sketch is only available for the mac to install the plugin you can go to sfdc.comsketch where we'll give you instructions on how to download and install it now we're actively working on this plugin and your feedback plays a key role in what we prioritize and shipping future releases so show your feedback and feature ideas to us click on the settings gear and select give us feedback we would like to hear from you in the future ok in the last 10 minutes we covered a lot of ground we looked at the lightning message service and how it greatly simplifies communicating between parts of our page independent of what technology stack the various components may have been built in we also looked at the slds plugin for sketch a tool that allows us to go from an idea to a pixel perfect prototype that we can very quickly validate all without having to write a single line of code that's pretty cool and with that i'm going to turn it over to karen hi everyone my name is karen fidelick and i'm a product manager here at salesforce on our developer services team when i work in an actual office i work out of our lewisville colorado office just outside of boulder i'm really excited to be here today to talk to you about what we have coming in the area of developer tools in the summer 20 release so let's jump in now in just a minute i'll be walking through a demo that highlights these key new features of our summer 20 release that deliver the ability to develop faster more productively and more securely we'll be looking at improvements to our sandbox development flow we'll see source tracking where changes are tracked automatically for us as they're made in the org and org dependent unlocked packages which allow you to take advantage of the benefits of unlocked packaging without the need to fully isolate dependencies we'll take a look at the local development for lwc which allows you to quickly build and verify changes without needing to first push them to an org and we'll look at a new pattern-based matching capability of data mask which provides additional configuration flexibility when masking data for secure testing and sandboxes which include data so let's dive right into the demo now we'll start in vs code where you can see that we have an sfdx project already created and open we'll be developing in a developer sandbox and so to start our development process we'll go ahead and open that dev sandbox now within this org we're doing development on a real estate application called dream house we've been given the task to add a days on the market component to the lower right section of this property explorer page so to make this change we'll go to the setup menu and select edit page to open up the lightning app builder in the lightning app builder we can see our page layout and we can see a days on market lightning web component that will drag onto the page to add the component we'll then save the page and hit back to go back to the property explorer page from here we can verify that the new component shows up as expected we can see it on the page where we placed it and when we select a property card we can see that the contents of the component update as expected we could do more extensive testing at this point as well as needed now in order to start the process of migrating the changes we just made to our downstream environments we'll go back to vs code and run the source pull command to pull the changes that we just made into our local project directory this command is leveraging our source tracking functionality previously only available with scratch orgs but now also available with sandboxes note that it's tracked these changed components automatically so that we haven't needed to keep track of it ourselves and it's pulled the changes into our local project directory pretty slick huh the next change that we're being asked to make is a simple change to adjust the max price in this property filter component to increase it from 1.2 million to 1.5 million we're going to make that change directly in the code so we'll go back to vs code now to make that change to locate the files that we need to edit we'll do a search for 1.2 million and we can see that it appears in the propertyfilter.html file as well as the propertyfilter.js source file so we'll open up each of these files and make the change to change it from 1.2 to 1.5 million and then we'll save these files now in order to verify this change we could push or deploy the source files into the org and verify them there but instead we're going to take advantage of the new lwc local development server capability to quickly validate the change in a local environment in order to do this we'll go find the property filter component in the file browser and select preview component locally and what this do is start up a local server where we can preview this component and quickly verify that it performs as expected and we have our change here where we've increased the max price to 1.5 million and so once we've verified this change we'll now go back to vs code to start the process of migrating the changes so now that we've got all our changes in our local project directory we're ready to package up these changes to prepare to migrate them to the uat environment where we'll be able to do integration testing and acceptance testing we'll do this using org dependent unlocked packaging org dependent unlocked packages are a new capability of packaging that allows us to take advantage of the benefits of unlocked packaging such as modularization versioning and easy upgradeability but without the need to have the package be fully independent it can be dependent on the rest of the unpackaged metadata in the org the source files that we have in this project are all those related to property pages and functionality in the app but they aren't entirely necessarily isolated from the rest of the application and thus would fail to be packaged into a traditional unlocked package due to dependencies that aren't contained within the current package so we'll first open up the project file so that we can see how it's being updated as we create the package then we'll start by creating a new package using the force package create command specifying a type of unlocked pointing in our source directory giving the package a name of summer 20 demo package and importantly specifying the new org dependent flag to indicate that this is to be an org dependent unlocked package once the package is created we'll create a new package version which is the versioned artifact that contains the changes and it will be installed into the downstream orgs we'll use the package version create command and point at the package id that we just created once the package version is ready we'll install that to our uat environment using the package install command specifying the package version id and the target demo uat org where we want to install it to once the package version is successfully installed we'll go to our uat sandbox where we can validate these changes in this environment and do further testing we can see that in its current state this uat sandbox doesn't yet reflect the changes that we just made namely that max price property filter change and the days on market component as this page hasn't yet been refreshed but when we refresh it we can now see those changes reflected both the 1.5 million max price and the filter component and the days on market component are now present so finally while we're in this uat sandbox let's take a look at the contacts in this test org we can see here that we have a list of contacts with names phone numbers and email addresses but if we compare this data with the context data in our production org we can see that the data is different this is because it's been masked using our data mask product while having realistic data in the sandbox org is needed for testing we also want to protect sensitive production data from being exposed to users of this sandbox so this is where data mask comes in and allows us to easily mask the sensitive data so you can see here that the email addresses phone numbers and names have been changed in this sandbox org so let's take a look at how this masking was configured and to do this we'll open up the data mask application in the production org and open up the configuration for this mask that we've set up we can look at the contacts masking configuration and we can see that the first and last names have been replaced by names but from a library so that they don't match the production data the phone numbers have been replaced by random numbers but keeping the phone number format the title's been removed completely and the email has been generated based on the pattern provided using a combination of the string test and a random number and an example.com string for the domain this pattern-based replacement is a new feature in this latest release so let's summarize what we just saw in this demo we saw how source tracking now available in sandboxes helps us track changes and keep our local and remote orgs in sync we saw how local lwc development can speed up the development cycle by allowing us to quickly make changes to code and see them running in a local dev server we saw how the new org dependent option of unlock packages allows us to leverage the goodness of unlocked packages even if we aren't able to yet fully modularize our org into fully independent packages and finally we saw the new pattern-based masking capability of data mask where you can create a pattern of fixed text random letters and numbers to suit your business rules while still making the data obfuscated now i want to quickly touch on some other exciting new features that we have coming in this release until now maintaining multiple packages in one project has required lots of manual manipulation of the default package set in your project.json now the cli recognizes that there are multiple package directories defined in your project and respects the order you set in your project.json file when pushing and pulling your metadata in a scratch org the salesforce cli tool belt code is now available in a read-only open source repository this repo includes the majority of the code that makes up the force commands this means that not only will you be able to look at the code but also run it play with it and even commit back if there's functionality that you can't wait to see in the salesforce cli using the diff file against org command you can quickly see a comparison between your local file and what's in the org with changes highlighted this is helpful to quickly see what your teammates have changed in the org without extra steps to retrieve and manually diff the files and finally with the push updates api for second generation managed and unlocked packaging you can seamlessly upgrade your packages in all installed orgs and finally i hope that we've wet your appetite a bit about the new stuff that we've quickly shown and talked about here but i encourage you to take a look at these features for yourself and let us know what you think additionally i want to make sure you're aware of another really useful resource our developer blogs on our salesforce developer website where you can find useful updates tips and deep dive articles on all kinds of topics across the developer experience so that wraps up this section and i'm happy to hand off next to courtney take it away courtney hello my name is courtney deschenzo and i'm a product manager in platform and today i'm here to introduce salesforce private connect salesforce private connect keeps communications private by allowing for bidirectional connections between salesforce and our launch partner aws to do this salesforce is deploying a managed private connection think of this like a vpn service between salesforce first party data centers and aws regions within the region salesforce deploys a managed transit vpc or virtual private cloud customers who are running vpcs within the same region can connect to the managed service through an aws feature called private link today i'm going to demonstrate how to create provision and tear down private links from within the salesforce setup experience within a summer 20 org under the security node and setup is a feature called private connect private connect allows for inbound connections this is where the traffic originates in aws and flows into salesforce or outbound connections where traffic originates in salesforce and flows out to aws services i'm going to demonstrate how to create an outbound connection to do this i need to expand my regions this shows me which aws regions this org has access to to create an outbound connection i need to whitelist the iam role in my endpoint service within my endpoint service in my customer vpc i need to go to my whitelisted principles i need to add to the whitelisted principles the iam role i just copied this allows the salesforce managed service to talk to this customer endpoint service once that is available i need to take the service name and copy it now i can go create my outbound connection so from within salesforce i click create outbound connection it defaults to aws private link i give my outbound connection a name i paste in the service endpoint i select the region i want this to run this in and now i'm going to select no i want to provision this connection later by selecting no it does not automatically provision an endpoint and leaves it in a status of unprovisioned now i can provision this at my convenience i'm going to go ahead and click actions and click provision to provision this endpoint you'll notice that it's allocating the endpoint at the moment to get the latest status i need to click actions sync here you can see that an endpoint was created in the salesforce managed service in a pending acceptance state in order to accept this i need to go back into the aws console under endpoint connections you will find my endpoint here i have to accept it once that's accepted it can take five to ten minutes before the connection becomes available for use in the meantime i already have another outbound connection that's in a ready state by summer 20 west i'll demonstrate how we can leverage summer 20 west within the salesforce environment to do this i need to use a named credential i have a name credential pointing to a private api in my inventory database inside of aws notice the new lookup field called outbound network connection and that it's pointing at our summer 20 west private connection anytime i make a call from within salesforce leveraging this name credential it will route through the private connection instead of the public proxy to demonstrate this i can show you through an http request calling that name credential and doing a get if i open up the log you will now see that the callout was successful with a 200 and we are hitting the url endpoint that's in my named credential this is a private api if i try to open this in postman and try to make the same call i get a could not get any response that's because the api is not exposed to the public internet and is only available through my private connection speaking of private connections let's see what the status of my private connection is if i sync you'll notice that it's in a ready state i can now send traffic through this connection however i would like to tear this down because i no longer need it from the actions menu i click teardown i'll see a teardown in progress to get the latest status i need to sync yet again now that it's in an unprovisioned state i can either reprovision this connection which will create a new private link or i can go ahead and delete it so from within salesforce i now have demonstrated how to create provision tear down and delete private links using a feature in summer 20 called salesforce private connect if you are a developer private connections are available through the metadata api in salesforce dx as well as in the salesforce cli lastly the pilot is still available until mid-july so reach out if you are interested in participating so that's it for me i'm going to pass it back to heather now thank you hi everybody welcome to the q and a portion uh super excited to be joined by all of the panelists who just gave you those amazing demos uh to answer all of your questions that have been coming in a quick reminder that you can post all of those questions on twitter at salesforce with the hashtag salesforcelive or in the release readiness trailblazer group we're paying attention to both of those and we're really looking forward to answering all of those questions now to get us started with this part i thought i would ask everyone who just finished watching each other demo what is your favorite feature that you just saw from this release so zaned let's start with you um so i really enjoyed all of it to be honest it was great to see kind of the the different uh all the different updates that are happening kind of across the company um the sketch integration i thought was really awesome that seems like a great segue over to kurupa what was your favorite feature that you just saw just say all of them it's kind of hard to pick any one particular feature because they all touch upon different use cases and different you know requests we've seen from a lot of people and so i'm going to take the politically correct answer and say all of them okay sure uh let's go over to karen did you have one that really stood out to you as your favorite feature this release um well i guess i'm kind of partial to my own my own features here um i'm excited about some of the capabilities that we're bringing um into sandbox-based development that we've had with scratch orbs and that we're expanding um to be supported with sandbox i think it's going to open up a lot of opportunities for folks to take advantage of more productive development patterns yeah well you stole mine so thank you um and courtney let's go after you did you have a favorite feature that you just saw well mine of course but i think heather just reiterated that so um out of the features that i saw today actually the einstein features of the ocr was was really interesting so that was exciting awesome yeah i'm really excited i think there was a lot of great content that we just showed you um and so now let's dive into some questions uh from you guys in the community uh let's start with a question for karupa i have one here that came in off the trailblazer community and they're wondering uh they don't work on mac so the salesforce lightning design system plugin for sketch isn't going to work for them and so they're hoping that you can help them know when this will be ported to a mac or into a windows app so that they can start getting hands-on with this cool tool yeah it's a common request we get and so you know please let us know what tools you're using on windows so that we can prioritize it accordingly but the sketch libraries themselves are you know pretty you know pretty comprehensive with the cover and we want to port them to other libraries and other platforms as well just so that everyone can get it we talked about adobe xd quite a bit we talked about figma and so we do want to bring it everywhere but let us know which ones we should prioritize first okay cool um that sounds great so i now have another question coming in um zanev you talked a lot about einstein pilots and i have a couple people here just wondering sort of what is the value they're going to get from joining in with that einstein pilot yeah so the pilots are free to to participate in and it's a great way to get early access to a lot of the einstein functionality and also be able to give feedback and influence the product very early on and so a lot of our customers once they join one pilot want to continue joining the pies because they really see um the value that they can have in shaping and making sure that the products fit their needs okay um sweet so now i'm seeing sorry i'm trying to keep up with all of the questions coming in thank you for all those uh the next one i'm seeing is actually uh for you karen uh they want to know a little bit more about the open source uh parts of the cli um yeah so i would refer you to we have a really great um blog on the open source cli on our developer community blog page so i would recommend taking a look at that that's got information about how to find it and information about the snapshot that we've published for our open source cli and then some of the plans that we've got upcoming so it's called let me just give you the open sourcing salesforce cli is the title of the blog on salesforce developers blog awesome and you can find that blog at developer.salesforce.com blogs i have that one memorized awesome that's super exciting and i love uh all of the emphasis that we've been doing recently on open sourcing technologies so thank you for continuing to work on that with your team okay the next question i have here is actually i believe for courtney um can you provide some details around the regarding the vpn used by private connect is this for regulatory purposes or just any other insight you can give there yeah thanks so we are we do have a vpn like connection that we're deploying between the first party data centers in aws regions it is going through compliance right now so we have hipaa compliance and a pci audit underway those should be completed by the time we are available for ga in july and then iso and sock are coming right after so it is for compliance um a lot of the interest has been from the healthcare community as well as the financial services community to send that private information through this through this tunnel awesome and that's why it's called private connect right correct awesome um okay so zanette i'm seeing another question come in here and people are wondering what is the benefit of what you call ood or out of domain yeah so um when you train these models so for intent for example the model really only knows what you teach it right so let's say you train it on categories a b and c right and then you give it a piece of text it will try to predict that it's one of those a b or c um and the benefit of od is like basically this other bucket that we create for you out of the box so that if a text comes in and it doesn't belong in any of those three categories it'll be able to tell you like it's not a it's not b it's not c it's actually other um so it's really beneficial for all use cases uh it's going ga with chat bots actually as well this summer so a lot of people are really excited about that and is that available with the vision and language services as well i think i missed that so so this is for the og or out of domain which is just simply other right another category um that's for language and then for vision we do have so out of domain another way of saying it is also negative data sets um so we do have a negative data set available for vision as well in our documentation that people can use awesome that's huge and that would increase my productivity a lot i know i used to use einstein before that was here and uh creating that other category myself was sometimes a little bit nerve-wracking because you didn't know that you were including everything you needed to exactly and we've been doing a lot of benchmarking and it's performing so well everyone is really excited about it so it's great to hear that you're also benefiting from it yes 100 okay um let's switch gears once more and i have a couple of questions for you karupa so let's get into our lms shoes for a moment here um really important question here and a couple of people have already liked and retweeted this so can a lightning component that is inside of flow throw an lms message outside the boundaries of that flow i believe so i you know i need to follow up on with my team to make sure that is actually what is happening so i followed up with the i already sent an email out from the twitter message on it so i'll get back to you all very quickly okay awesome no it's really great to see that and i know um that that person also have another question for you but this time actually about the plugin um so does that slds sketch plugin come with any templates that represent uh lightning community layouts or elements i know that's a really big thing right now yeah it does not currently but it's something that we are planning adding more of in video you saw that we had a version from the people starting age march and we'd like to provide more starting points and lightning communities right up there in terms of what we want to provide next okay and i'm also seeing one more question coming in about that plug-in and they're actually asking um about the sketch equivalent which is lunacy and they're curious if you've been considering that for your future developments on that plug-in i have not and i think it's like you know we have a list of tools we're constantly evaluating so the feedback you'll provide and like which tools you'd like to see next i think will help us prioritize which ones we deliver in the plug-in for in the future okay awesome and i'll make sure you get that link to that trailblazer community post so you can see exactly what tools they're talking about um sweet so let's see here i'm just scrolling through um let's switch over to courtney for a couple of questions here um we're wondering is private conductor replacement for mulesoft we're a little bit confused on when we should use that versus our normal neurosoft connectors for that important data thanks heather uh no so it's not a replacement for any of our current integration products think of this as that secure tunnel so you still need to do the integration somehow whether that's using mulesoft uh using external services using salesforce connect or in the inbound direction just hitting our rest and soap and bulk apis it's just providing that communication layer it's not actually creating those integrations you still need to do that outside of this product okay and then um people are also asking they've seen some different branding and they're wondering is aws connect and salesforce private connect for aws the same product no thanks for the question um aws connect is a product in service cloud it's for telephony so it's a partnership product that we did with aws to embed their telephony product this is different obviously this is more of like a vpn service so this is a challenge with branding but they are separate products okay great to know and good to know when we're googling things and trying to get our answers and we come up with the the aws connect product that we know that that's not actually what we're dealing with here so thank you okay and um let's switch gears again sorry for all the contact switching for those of you watching but i'm trying to keep up with your questions so um these ones are for you karen we've got a couple um the first one is really just that what people want to understand which items you discussed were paid versus on standard and i believe most of them are standard but we just like a little bit of clarity there yeah um so the only one i believe that i talked about that's paid is the data mask product everything else from the vs code and the source tracking and unlock packaging cli functionality that's all free functionality okay and then that add-on for data mask how might i go about getting that yeah so to purchase data mask work through your ae and it's actually a managed package that will be installed once once it's packaged but you need to get a license for it which goes through the normal um purchase and provisioning process with your ae awesome super helpful thank you i know data mask is a feature we're really excited about so it's just good to know how we can get access to making sure that our data stays secure which seems to be a theme today we're talking a lot about security which is you know our number one value so i'm really proud of that um okay so then our next question for you karen is more on enabling that source turning tracking and or dependent uh beta features how do we do that yeah um so the source tracking with sandboxes feature um the way that that gets enabled is there is a preference setting in the dev hub page and setup to enable it and that enablement is done in the production org so this is something that is can be kind of confusing and not what you might expect but you enable this setting in the production org and then all developer and developer pro sandboxes that are created from that production org will have source tracking enabled as this is a summer 20 feature you need to wait until the production org is on summer 20 in order to enable it so people have been looking for it given that sandboxes have rolled to summer 20. um there isn't a way to enable it directly in the sandbox and that's because we want to make sure that every time the sandbox is created or refreshed it continues to have that enabled so it'll be enabled in the production org um as far as the org dependent unlock packaging feature um that one there's no special switch or anything to turn that on from a beta perspective you want to make sure that you have the the um packaging preference enabled in the dev hub again which is for unlock packaging and managed packaging for second generation packages and once that's on then in the cli all you need to do is use then there's a new org dependent flag that you'll use on the command line um and and that will let you take advantage of the or dependent unlock packaging feature okay that was a lot and i think you also responded to that on the trailblazer community so people can go and get that actual download of all those things that you just highlighted um but thank you for just highlighting it again i think uh the important things to know there was that you set everything in your dev hub is that the correct yeah these things need to be enabled in the dev hub great um and then and then of course on summer 20 october 20. exactly all right and i do have one more question for you here um in our sfdx project files will the multiple package directory structure work for both org-based and package-based development um yes so this this feature is actually um it is not contingent on you actually using packaging so it's just um a way to help organize your file structure um it does not require you to actually be using our packaging technology you can but you don't need to so because of that it's supported for either an org based development process or a package-based development process okay great to know and just good to know that it is compatible with both just not at the same time okay um so i have another question actually two here i think for kurupa um tools is not something that the lightning design system team has previously invested in in the past what sort of inspired this change i think we looked at workflows we looked at what the buffer is and the tools we know that both designers and developers work together to build the kind of sales force you guys want and so what we wanted to do is how can we make these workflows smoother like some definitely the tools have their own particular needs that are very exciting for designers to use and so we want to keep them there as much as they can same with developers as well and so that's one of the big motivations really around us releasing the plugin for sketch and also we also released like the validator for vs code and we're just getting started really in our journey on making these workflows just more consistent awesome and i love that being able to have a developer and a designer and all the different parts of the org work together i think that's really a core value here at salesforce and where we empower our builders to do things maybe with clicks and codes so i just um it makes me really excited that now we're also going to be able to design together so thank you um i have one more question for you and it's actually my own question as somebody who's previously migrated from visual force to aura to lightning web components when i saw your announcement about lightning message service i got really excited and then i got worried how should i go about migrating all of the components and communication that i already have to lightning message service i'd say that if you already have a solution that works really well and you know there's you and you're happy with it then the migration isn't absolutely critical but if you are making more investments into it or you want to migrate an existing page it does not have the combination at point you know i would strongly consider eating a message there's a little of some of the combination for it with the police api and so i'd say you know okay so case by case just like when we were originally doing our migrations and transitions from different sets of lightning web components uh we can use what we were already using that's totally fine okay awesome um so i am seeing another question here um for courtney courtney can you hear me yes okay great i just wanted to make sure um so for inbound private connect is it possible to secure certain users or apis so that only they can connect over that tunnel yes um yeah so within within the inbound vpc so you created private link endpoint inside the customer's vpc and then you map it to the my domain and then you can use the identity and access management rules within the customer's vpc on the inbound side to control who can send traffic through that inbound and then on the flip side you can control who has access to the name credentials to send outbound messaging so it is available through both the standard sales force sharing like crud flash sharing type capabilities inside of the org as well as identity and access management rules inside of the aws console okay awesome there's a lot of ways to customize that then that's super sweet um okay i am now seeing a question come in for use a neb um people are wondering what is the future regarding the entity recognition einstein api um they read somewhere that that was being used internally but it hadn't been made available externally yet and they were wondering if that was on the roadmap yep so i'm glad you asked um so it's actually coming out this summer so not quite with the summer release but really soon after so we're looking at safe harbor but we're looking at uh july end of july uh having that available uh for our developers to start leveraging as well um and for those who don't know what it is so ner basically stands for name entity recognition and it tells you the i like to explain it's like the part of speech of a sentence right but instead of like adverb or verb it's basically things like company or name and so you're able to do a lot of cool things and basically structure unstructured data and i love how that question also answered when ner is going ga so you said uh later this summer awesome okay um and then um karen back to you for a quick second people are wondering dev hub is a new term to them where can they start to learn more about dev hubs yeah um so dev hub is um that is where you set up some of the settings for our development features um to take advantage of some of the salesforce dx capabilities around things like scratch orgs um and packaging second generation packaging so it is available through setup if you go to the setup menu and setup tree and just search for dev hub it's under i think it's under developer developer development but it's just dev space hub and you can see all the settings that are on there and a dev hub is a production org that you basically designate as this hub from which you will be able to create things like scratch orgs and packages and there is a trailhead module on that correct um there is a trailhead module on getting started with like salesforce dx is probably the best one okay great so uh we will make sure you get that link in the trailblazer community to that trailhead module that can get you started with learning how to get hands-on with the dev hub thank you for that clarification there karen okay i'm seeing just a few more questions coming in um and i think we're getting close to the end here but courtney i have one more for you um oh and this one's really weird for me so i don't know any of these terms how does private connect work with amazon app flow and can you maybe tell us a little bit about what app flow is yeah thanks um so appflow is a product that amazon just released in fact i'm sorry april um it just went ga it's like a lightweight integration tool allows you to select your destination and your source and then move data between the destination and source so we worked with amazon to make sure that salesforce was available as either a source or a destination within this tool it basically connects to our rest api or to our bulk api depending on the volumes and then we also worked with them to make sure that we can not only connect through the public internet which is available today if you go into the console you can create a workflow to do that but you can also do that come july over the private connection so you can set up these workflows to you know move data around or execute processes through the aws environment through the private connection using app flow okay cool that was really helpful thank you i feel like i was a little bit lost but that that's really um awesome okay one more question and karen it's actually back to you we've got a lot of questions about tooling um and the bit this one is a big one um so as more and more features are getting added to our salesforce dx products packaging and release management it's getting kind of scary to think about transitioning to that tool set what is your recommendation for how to start in that journey um yeah that's a really good question um there's a lot that we offer and it can be it can seem overwhelming um what we usually recommend is the best place to kind of get started is to just get this the salesforce cli installed um and that really provides the like entry to a lot of the capabilities that we have and you can take baby steps into those functionality so you know if you're just doing for instance um metadata deployments into your sandbox and production orgs you can do that directly from our salesforce cli and the next step might be to start using our new source format as opposed to the metadata like the traditional metadata form is just a slight more decomposed version of the metadata xml format and then you can gradually you know start moving forward and obviously take advantage of source tracking capabilities that we've got now and some of the packaging capabilities down the line as you're ready but it i would just stress that you can you know get started in many ways with the way that you're developing today but starting to take advantage of some of the new tooling that we have with the cli and vs code and some of the new source formats and things like that again i would refer also to the trailhead modules for for guidance there totally i think um there's there's a lot that we have and it's awesome and i'm really glad that we're investing in this so it's nice to know how to get started with it so thank you um and i think this is our final question that has just come in and it's actually for you karupa um one we did get a shout out they love your cat um but the next thing was can you change the font type and size for labels with sketch um and can they get a link to download that sketch library and so we'll do that yes you can you know in sketch all the layers are available for you to modify so you can change the colors the font you can do a whole host of customizations that you want you know the only thing to keep in mind is to be thoughtful about the changes so that you know if you want to go beyond what slds provides out of the box to make sure accessibility and all the other important details are are maintained with your own custom designs the best place to download it is the is the link that was in the presentation but you can also go to lightningdesignsystem.com which is the official website for slds and then we'll have the tools page there where you can go and find the link to sketch download it and then be able to have it working with your with your current setup awesome okay cool so we're gonna uh wrap it up here i have a few shout outs so i want to go ahead and share um just a little bit more about how you can continue to learn more about all the features that we've discussed today we've demoed we've answered as many questions as we could get to but we know that you want to learn even more so you can do that by going to s force dot co slash learn more where there are some extra blog posts links to the trailhead modules we've talked about and just more content here for you to continue to dive in and understand how you can start getting ready to take advantage of these features for your orgs and with that i would like to wrap up with a warm thank you thank you for coming to our first virtualized uh release readiness live for developer preview and we hope you have had a wonderful time and we can't wait to see you next week [Music] you
