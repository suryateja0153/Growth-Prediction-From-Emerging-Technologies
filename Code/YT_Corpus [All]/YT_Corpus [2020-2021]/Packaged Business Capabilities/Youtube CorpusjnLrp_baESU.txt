 Hi everyone my name is Kalyna Spooner and  I would like to welcome everyone to today's   first podcast series titled the Paperless  Conversation. Every month, VKS will host   a little podcast where we will be showcasing  different trends, opportunities and technologies   that are being used by the manufacturing industry  to transition into Industry 4.0 so before we get   into today's hot topic I would like to welcome  our guest Ed Zimmerman. So, welcome Edward.  - Thank you very much for having me today,  Kalyna. I'm very excited to be here at this   first ever Podcast of The Paperless Conversation.  Yes, so I thought maybe you could spend a little   bit of time introducing yourself. I know  that you are the VP of Business Development   for The Social Distancer Technologies, as well  as a business development manager here at CMP,   which is our sister company. So yeah, welcome! - Thank you, I'm really excited to be here,   as you said, I'm the VP business development  for The Social Distancer Technologies   as well as being one of the Business Development  Managers at CMP - Advanced Mechanical Solutions,   so we're really keen to talk to you today  about how VKS has helped CMP over the years   and some of the tools and strategies that we've  developed as a manufacturer to help us get through   the COVID pandemic up until now, at least. - Awesome, yeah I know, I know that that's   what a lot of our viewers hopefully are  tuning into today so again before we kind   of dive into today's hot topic I thought  I might spend a little bit of time just   introducing to some of our viewers for the first  time essentially who VKS is, where we came from   and what we're trying to do today. Sounds great! - Alright, so like I said, just quickly, VKS   essentially is a digital work instruction software  platform that was actually built out of CMP here   and what we're looking to do is help manufacturers  one transition from paper to a digital format   whether that's implementing videos pictures even  tech steps and to have your operators have a much   more visual understanding of their day-to-day  assembly work rather than having the binder and,   you know, the floating binder and having to  print and reprint. So throughout the years, VKS   has evolved, as has the manufacturing industry,  now with VKS we have the ability to add in Smart   Forms and Smart Tools which will allow you to be  able to capture data be able to then have that in   a report setting so management can look through  it and our latest one is now with our API we're   able to communicate with other databases which  is pretty cool you can communicate with your ERP   you can even start to communicate with different  tools: Torque Wrenches, Test Benches so VKS has   has done a really really good job at evolving  not only from you know CMP but now we are global   we are worldwide we have over 350  companies that are using it for different   you know for different reasons it's in different  industries right now we work closely with   automotive manufacturing we're now entering the  food and beverage industry, aerospace division so   that in and of itself is what VKS does we're  really just trying to help manufacturers get   away from paper and be able to have your standard  best practices stored and archived in a software   so yeah that's VKS thank you for for bearing with  me for a couple of minutes discussing that so   I thought Ed you could take a little bit of time  now if you don't mind talking about the creation   of VKS since it stemmed from CMP. - Absolutely, I'd be pleased to.  - Awesome! - So, as you mentioned, CMP - Advanced Mechanical   Solutions, we are the sister company to VKS and we  developed the software over the last decade or so   to solve a lot of the problems that we have  as a manufacturer here in North America,   CMP for those that don't know us we are a  high mix low volume contract manufacturer   largely specialized on mechanical systems but  also doing complex electro mechanicals as well   we serve a variety of industries we're in medical  transportation homeland security defense and   increasingly in warehouse automation as well which  is growing into an absolutely enormous industry   so the reason we needed a solution like VKS is  because of what I alluded to earlier high mix low   volume we have dozens of clients we have dozens  of different programs hundreds and thousands of   different parts very very difficult in a dynamic  workplace like ours to effectively manage   all the tribal information and key cool data that  each client needs for every one of their products   and so when we saw that paper-based routings and  paper-based drawing packages were insufficient to   that task we elected to develop a digital solution  that would allow us to transmit huge volumes of   information to our employees but in addition to  that capture a lot of information back many of   our clients require us to do inspection steps or  serialization or any one of a number of different   processes that would require an operator to put  information back into the system so that it can   be captured and shared with our end client VKS  allows us to do that and so we leverage that   at every step of our manufacturing process  you will not find a workstation CMP that   does not have a VKS system installed and  makes the lives of the operators easier   program managers operations managers everybody has  access to huge amounts of data at their fingertips   so that they can track the performance of a  program any recurring quality issues on a program   and also be able to share a lot of the information  directly with our clients so that we can work with   them on optimizations and that really is to  everybody's benefit so VKS certainly for CMP   has been a world change or world-changing exercise  and has really allowed us to keep pace with growth   in our market CMP is growing at a remarkable  rate compared to a lot of manufacturers in   North America and without VKS that kind of growth  and that kind of adaptability to our client needs   would be very difficult to achieve yeah oh  big time so just quickly on that topic of   adaptability and kind of just being able to to  maneuver with what's going on right now in the   world and stuff like that I thought you could take  a little bit of time as well to kind of talk about   how CMP is dealing with COVID right because as as  everyone knows that is not only today's hot topic   on the podcast but I think the hot topic that is  just globally going around manufacturers offices   schools everywhere how our manufacturing  companies and how are companies in general   adapting their work environments to promote  safety for their employees and being able to still   produce what needs to be produced absolutely  absolutely you know CMP you know we're not   unique necessarily in our manufacturing in the  manufacturing environment here in North America   um you know companies all across the continent  really around the world have had to change the way   that they do business in order to accommodate the  additional restrictions imposed by the academic   you know first and foremost our concern of course  is the safety and welfare of our employees and so   we right away started taking measures such as  social distancing introducing additional PPE   shifts changes so that we don't have congregations  of people within the facility at specific times of   the day so you know as much as possible  we tried to manage things in that way   and certainly it was it was very helpful um  you know CMP had to remain open through the   duration because of the critical services that  we provide to a lot of different industries chief   amongst them being the medical industry yeah the  medical is big one and warehouse automation now   we know also that a lot of our clients have  suffered as the clients of many viewers have   suffered as well and in general the business  environment has become a lot more complicated   so you know what we're trying to do right now  at CMP is you know keep our staff safe keep our   you know critical core customers satisfied and  keep them you know well supplied with materials   so that they in turn can go on to support the  broader economy either in warehouse automation   homeland security or medical even transportation  that's a critical service it needs to be provided   so beyond the the more traditional PPE type  approaches you know we wanted to find a way to   reduce workplace anxiety because workplace anxiety  is is a major consideration a lot of employees are   very uncomfortable coming into work when they know  that an illness like this is being transmitted   within the community so one of the things that we  wanted to do was find a way to provide a measure   of confidence to employees that they were in good  heads that they could maintain appropriate social   distance that if somebody got sick we would be  able to very quickly as an organization react   and and advise that people need to be advised get  people tested and as much as possible limit the   spread of anything like that within our workplace  now we've been very fortunate we have not had any   kind of spread of COVID within our environment  but for a lot of companies that's not the case   yeah that's not the case exactly forced to shut  down and there's impact to their clients impact   their revenue impact to their employees who  aren't taking a home a paycheck as anticipated   so we checked the market we tried to find a  solution a technology solution that we could   employ to help us manage those challenges and you  know the unfortunate reality was it simply did not   exist and so you know in working with with two  of our partners pro-mark electronics which is a   Montreal area contract manufacturer doing more on  cable assemblies filled and visual assets which is   a technology company based out of New Hampshire  we developed our ProxAssure solution which is a   wearable device that's exceptionally easy to use  doesn't require any additional infrastructure   and what it will do is it will advise wearers when  they're closer than the six foot social distancing   requested by health authorities so it'll buzz it  will sound an alarm tone it'll flash a red light   and it'll let you know that you've approached  the colleague too closely and to take a step back   in order to maintain social discontent in addition  to that the device captures contact tracing data   and so it's going to be recording the the date the  time the duration and the frequency and distance   of those interactions so that we can create what  we call a dosage profile and that's going to   allow people if someone you know should fall ill  within the workplace to very very quickly hone   in on those individuals that are at high risk and  advise them either to get tested go into routine   and also you can take that data and now  share public health authorities because   it's really really important for public health  authorities to have access to this information   one of the things that's really great about  our solution is that it's not relying on   ultra wideband or wi-fi or Bluetooth all  of those technologies unfortunately are   subject to a lot of interference okay especially  in a complex manufacturing environment where   there's a lot of machinery um heavy equipment yeah  the connections can get lost easily yeah things   will bounce around they're gonna reflect off the  walls and they're not gonna be able to go through   people um and so the reliability of those systems  is highly suspect and the data that they generate   as well is unreliable okay and so we're using  a technology called ruby it is magnetic based   it operates in an exceptionally low frequency and  that allows us to avoid a lot of those problems   that higher frequency solutions are subject to  and so our solution will work through a table   it'll work through a 20-ton fabricator it'll  work through doors walls it even works underwater   and so we're able to offer our clients 99.9  read accuracy regardless of the environment that   they're working in and that means that all those  false positives and false negatives that you're   getting from other systems that are now in the  market are all avoided and the quality of the data   that you're able to generate for contact tracing  is exceptionally reliable and the interaction of   units that that inform people when they're getting  too close to one another is equally reliable   and so people will very quickly over the course of  a few days get a better understanding of what six   feet really means and their behaviors naturally  will adapt you know we're human beings yeah when   we're in conversation we want to get closer  to one another we want to close that distance   it's our natural inclination that's a very big  challenge in a social distancing context like we   see right now in the pandemic to manage and so  this device will nudge you a little bit with a   buzz or a beep or a flashing light to let you  know what six speed really is and we've seen   that a lot of people very very quickly begin  to adopt an appropriate distance when they're   interacting with colleagues quite naturally  and so it's very powerful in that respect   yeah it sounds like it sounds like an amazing  tool that not only can be used on the shop floor   and in a manufacturing setting but it could also  be applied in my opinion to offices workspaces the   educational systems to make sure that everyone's  keeping their distance so yeah absolutely i mean   we're seeing interest from a lot of different  industries obviously manufacturing the defense   sector is very concerned with the impact of  social distancing on their ability to maintain   their operational capacity um food and beverage  obviously early on in the pandemic a lot of   food and beverage manufacturers were heavily  impacted so we're getting a lot of interest   from that sector education as well the very last  thing we want to do is shut down schools if we   give schools the ability to help their students  and staff not just maintain appropriate social   distancing but also in the event of an infection  very quickly track it down and mitigate the   potential impacts all of those things and not  only mitigate the the impact but the spread of   it if you could narrow down where which classroom  or which offices came from you notified those   that that group that weren't necessarily  there and then boom you can continue on and   make sure that they take the appropriate  measures to quarantine and to stay safe and   help not spread the outbreak yeah that's  absolutely right that's absolutely right and so   we're working very closely with with a number of  manufacturers um food and beverage manufacturers   education institutions and the feedback right up  until now has been overwhelmingly positive and so   we're really excited to be I mean it's already on  the market but we're really excited to be able to   broaden our scope and bring it to more users this  is an amazing product so I was wondering if we   could take a little bit of time and actually show  our viewers how it looks what it and how it works   yeah sure okay awesome let's put on our masks  yes it's mask time very important that we are   using appropriate PPE so let's put those masks on  so I have a couple of things to show you today so   I have our second generation unit we'll get  into that in a minute but essentially we sell   the units in boxes of 10 okay and I'm just going  to open this up very quickly here and we'll take   two of them we get the the packaged  ones to test amazing thank you very much   so you can go ahead and open that up there's  a charge cable in there usually that comes   with its own charge cable the USB-charged  and you're going to use that same cable to   download any kind of contact tracing data in the  event that you need to exercise that capability   okay mine's on there you go are you going  running I'm up and running sir okay perfect so as am I so very simple a little  belt clip on the back right here   and we're just going to pop it onto our belt  very easy to carry now once again there's no   infrastructure associated with these units so  we're not talking about antennas or portals or   repeaters or any kind of item development take  it out of the box turn it on put it on your belt   and we're good to go so our viewers hopefully  you can see I'm wearing on my belt oh Kalyna   yeah we're too close sorry sir in my space now  I'll back it up there you go so the devices are   really easy to use basically what it's doing  is continuously transmitting that low frequency   magnetic signal 10 times a second and each device  is always listening for the sound you know the so it's really accurate over this distance we're  accurate within about three inches so even just   rotating my hips like that we'll see that we're  getting great accuracy and we're getting advised   that we need to maintain our distance and what  this device is simultaneously doing is tracking   all that critical data that i mentioned so you  know your device identity my device identity   how long day how long we've been interacting and  so if over the course of the day you and i should   pass each other in the hallway a couple of times  and maybe accumulate 10 or 15 seconds of proximity   right now we're going to record that but we  also know that that amount of proximity is   not especially important and so you know it'll be  highlighted it'll be recorded but we're not going   to necessarily take the actions now let's say for  example you and i were working collaboratively at   a workstation and we were 15 20 30 minutes in  very close proximity proximity that right away   is a sign that if one of us is sick the other  needs to be advised okay tested potentially   quarantined and so you know this device gives  organizations that capability right out of the box   and allows them to you know manage that  aspect of this very complicated situation   within their workforce amazing yeah  absolutely and just out of curiosity quickly   was VKS at all involved in the actual  operations and assembly of the product   absolutely absolutely so we developed this as  i said with our partners okay so the device   is very much a cross-border collaboration we  have people in Canada CMP and Promark people   in The United States visible assets that are  working on developing this solution both this   generation as well as the future generation that  I'll show you shortly the manufacturing is divided   almost equally between Canada and us so we've got  components that are being made in New Hampshire   it's occurring here in north over here in Canada  very collaborative very international um you know   both of our countries are suffering through this  pandemic together and working collaboratively   in this way is a great example of how that kind  of um i guess collective approach would be very   very helpful to solve a real problem well and at  the end of the day it's very nice to see a North   American product that is made here that is grown  here and that is sold here absolutely and you know   we're because we're doing the final assembly here  at CMP we are using VKS to assemble these units   and that's one of the great strengths of VKS is  we're able to take a brand new product a brand new   solution for which there's very little in the form  of you know assembly information or critical data   and we're able to use VKS to affect serialization  we're able to use VKS to guide employees through   the assembly process perform tuning on the  antennas programming of the units all of that   can be done within VKS and beyond that we can use  VKS to capture critical data from the operators   who need to capture some of that information  from the units as they're going together and you   know we can generate reports we can share these  things internally share it with our suppliers   so that we can optimize the manufacturing  process optimize our output optimize our quality   on a day-by-day basis and it's a very very  powerful tool well I'm glad VKS was able to   be part of this beautiful product that you  were able to show us thank you very much   we were thrilled to have VKS in  our disposal yes give me the balls perfect we'll disinfect them and then send them  on their way now one of the things that I also   alluded to is our second generation yeah those  two very quickly this one's fancy so it's smaller   it's about about one third the size of the of the  original unit it's got a louder speaker it's got   a stronger vibration because instead of carrying  this necessarily on your belt we wanted to give   people more flexibility in how they're using  them so it can be carried on a lanyard it can be   carried on a little um you know spring-loaded belt  bit like we have here you can put it onto your   belt you can wear it on your arm on the armband  so there's a lot of different ways this unit can   be used and these units the second generation  they continue to interact with the generation   one so if you have generation one you can try  to generate two and um they offer all the same   contract tracing capabilities that we have in the  current solution but in a smaller form factor with   some improvements to the to the alarms mode to the  alarm modes and um this was really developed in   response to a lot of the data that we have from  our clients from using the current solution so   as you can see I think you're too close to  the one and only you know there you go so   let's take a step over here there you go  I'm a little bit too close to that one   I don't think I'm too close to you no but  this is awesome so this unit is going to um   be our second generation as I mentioned this  is going to be deployed much more broadly   and it's more portable it's driven by a lot of the  feedback from our clients we're really excited to   bring this to market it's not the final four  factor this is more of a test article but um   you know they they work exceptionally well  they have the same level of accuracy we're   collecting all the same data and we're going to  have this second generation available for shipment   around the end of the month of November awesome  we're really really excited well thank you so   much for having showcased that and being able to  show the different models and the different way   that they work and the different functionalities  that they have and just out of curiosity have   you gotten any feedback from operators who  are not even just operators but from office   representatives or anyone who is actually wearing  this how what's what's the vibe that you're   getting feedback okay all very positive people  are thrilled of the performance of the units   they're very very reliable one of the biggest  things that we've encountered in the feedback is   people realizing just how many close interactions  they're having yeah I didn't realize what six feet   was until you actually were able to stand there  and say like oh you're actually too close when   in your mind you think six feet is what six  feet is in your head well that's it and so   people are surprised what six feet really means  and how often throughout the day they're they're   impeding on that distance you know people we've  done surveys before and after and so beforehand   people might have said oh you know four or five  times you know during the course of the day   and then when we collect the data from the units  what we realize is actually 25 or 30 times a day   oh wow right that's a huge huge variance and  it's eye-opening it's eye-opening to a lot of   a lot of users and they see right away just  how applicable it can be because they failed to   realize not out of a lack of analysis but without  having the appropriate tools to really reward   how many interactions occurring you know we're  subject to our own interpretation and we're not   necessarily paying attention to what's going  around us all the time during the course of   the day and so having a tool like this that can  just give you that nudge give you that reminder   and then simultaneously provide you with the  knowledge that you are capturing critical contact   tracing data in the event of an issue very very  powerful awesome and with respect to that um do   you have something on the machine or on the device  itself I'm just thinking off the top of my head i   know that a lot of operators sometimes there's no  two ways about it you have to be working together   in much more close proximity than the six feet  which you're supposed to not be in you're not   supposed to work super super close together what  happens if for example an operator or um you   know in an office unfortunately you have to be in  close proximity is there a way to mute the device   while still record the fact that they've been in  contact because i could see that if it's buzzing   buzzing buzzing for 30 minutes you'd want to  lose your mind a little bit but absolutely we can to turn them back on we can also   we have a user interface where you can control  certain aspects okay so you can turn down the   volume turn down the vibration strength reduce  the strength the led brightness and also change   the interacting distance so if a guideline should  change you need to reduce it to three or four   feet you can do that if you want to increase it to  seven or eight feet you can do that as well and so   we're offering our clients a lot of adaptability  and flexibility specific for their workplace and   so some clients you know they really want to have  that strong vibration and that strong tone because   their operators are wearing hearing protection  or you know heavy clothing things like that   other operators in the office contacts really want  to dial that all back what we want to do mostly is   capture the contact tracing data and not be overly  disrupted to our staff during the course of their   work day and so the UI that we have to adjust the  zone or modes allows them to achieve that awesome   well I really really want to thank you for coming  on today I think it's an awesome product it's a   North American product it's been a huge huge huge  help here at CMP I know we've started to integrate   it upstairs also in the offices and I think that  as long as covet is around and i believe that   we're just going to have to learn to  adapt with this pandemic and just learn to   to keep our distance that this is just  going to be a product that's going to be   everywhere soon so thank you so much for coming on  today's podcast I'm so happy to have had you as my   first guest and i hope maybe you'll be on another  one sometime soon I would love that thank you so   much it's been great being here today and having  the opportunity to talk not just about our social   distancer but also VKS and genesis within CMP and  really excited to see more of these podcasts going   forward yes well thank you so much so if anyone is  interested in learning a little bit more about The   Social Distancer Technologies specifically the  processor you can always visit the website let   me just make sure that I'm seeing it correctly  it's gosocialdistancer.com you can always ask   for Ed you could find him on LinkedIn as well go  harass him on LinkedIn and if anyone would like to   learn a little bit more about VKS perhaps it's a  demo or a trial or just get on the phone and get   a little bit more about our product you can always  visit VKS at www.vksapp.com so everyone thank you   so much for tuning in um our next series will be  in about a month not sure what the topic will be   hopefully we'll have COVID underway probably  not but here's hoping so everyone continue   to stay safe and see you next time! - Thank you so much have a great day!
