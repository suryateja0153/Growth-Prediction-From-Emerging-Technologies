 Just imagine your startup is really starting to take off your lead engine is regularly finally engaging qualified leads your sales engine is converting those qualified leads to paying customers at breakneck pace but you're struggling to meet demand as your production engine isn't able to keep up and what you do deliver doesn't always live up to what you sold your customer and you're starting to see more and more negative reviews of your product or service which could wipe out all of your hard work and starting to make all starting to make investors nervous what do you do now in this episode we're going to discuss the best method for building a production and delivery engine that can consistently fulfill your customer's expectations and generate viral growth while reducing your production and delivery costs over time and will cover a whole lot more i'm stephen white and this is building lean hey there awesome founders welcome back once again to building lean our series of workshops that cover the steps and activities your startup must take to build key business functions to sustainably generate revenues if you're interested in growing your startup by building lean please subscribe to our youtube channel and click that notification bell nearby so you can receive the latest insights that will help you avoid mistakes that cost you time and money now let's get to why you're here this episode continues our dive into the activities of milestones you need to complete in order to successfully achieve the second startup phase of repeatable sales and delivery once again as a quick refresher of repeatable sales and delivery that means the ability to repeatably sell produce and deliver your product while satisfying a growing number of customers as you solve the compelling problem they similarly experience in other words this phase is about automating your key business activities in preparation for scale growth all while not losing focus on serving your customers needs now during our last episode i cover the process of building a sales engine that can regularly convert your qualified leads into paying customers which will enable you to ensure you are generating sufficient enough sufficient margins to eventually achieve profitability during this episode we're focused on the process of building a production delivery engine that can regularly produce your product or service and deliver it to your customers now in case you're thinking wait wait wait wait wait why am i going to watch this video this seems like a complete waste of time for me because i don't actually produce or deliver my product that this must be for physical products or in-person services shoot my startup actually provides an online web application which means every customer uses the same instance of the software app or platform okay fair point while you are correct to a certain extent let me share this thought before you jump out of this video and go watch some cat videos remember no software is ever complete or bug bug free think about this way every digital tool software app or service requires changes updates or new features facebook amazon netflix youtube will each push a half dozen fixes today to their service or platform and you don't even know this as a customer as those changes that you do recognize only occur through app updates as you're unfamiliar with changes to their platform or back-end also this is true even from physical products that contain some digital component due to the ability to push over the air updates or your user's ability to download a firmware change not only do customers expect it you're at a competitive disadvantage if you haven't engineered or an ability to keep your solution current everything from tesla's to podcasting equipment are being designed around an efficient production delivery engine so what when i say produce what i mean is the update and maintenance cycle of software and when i talk about delivery what we mean is the implementation required to start using the software for the very first time as well as any data or user training changes for each new update i bring that up just to anchor you if you think production delivery doesn't apply to a web application or app or some other software-based tool and by the way the challenge you face only gets more complicated when you have more complex products that serve a variety of industries and customers so regardless uh if your startup is focused on digital or physical product or service by being able to consistently produce and deliver your solution you can ensure high product quality and even better by consistently producing your product or service you can optimize the user experience to drive up production and adoption rates okay now what do we actually mean when we talk about our production and delivery engine as in what makes up that engine well with similar components to your lead engine sales engine we view the production delivery engine in the same conceptual framework specifically as entrepreneurs an engine consists of some automated process an instrumentation panel that helps you monitor the performance of the process and controls that help you manage the operations of an engine for the third milestone of the repeatable sales and delivery startup development phase we need to build the production and delivery engine so let's look at the components of our production engine production delivery engine in detail right now the production and delivery engine consists of three elements number one the production and delivery process which is guided by the user's product adoption journey number two the instrumentation which are the kpis that help you measure unit production volume and cost as well as customer satisfaction and adoption and number three the controls which are the forecasted number of unit sales your production capacity and the capital spending required to increase production capacity so now let's look at each component in detail starting with the process as a quick reminder there are many benefits to following a process as it enables your startup to number one onboard new staff easily and fast number two create a common understanding among team members that results in better coordination of work between team resources and number three it helps you find and fix issues at critical points in the process more quickly so in a phone a few moments i'll cover the tools that can help you build an optimal process that is easy for you and your team to understand and implement within your startup now the purpose of following a production and delivery process is to ensure consistent production and delivery of your product or service to your customers without implementing the production and delivery process you'll consistently miss revenue goals frustrate your customers when they use your solution and lose any brand value that you've created since the production delivery engine has four distinct sub processes the instrumentation consists of eight kpis so in a moment i'll show you how each component maps to the appropriate sub process because i don't want to overwhelm you oh by the way depending on your product or service you may adopt additional kpis that help you identify specific bottlenecks in the production process or even the delivery process so let's get started with the two kpis related to the production plan which are your number one your unit cost trend which enables you to validate your cost reduction hypothesis and number two your unit volume trend which helps you validate your production volume hypothesis the next two kpis relate to your production process itself which are number one your unit production trend which helps you which which you ensures you can grow your production capacity number two your production defect rate trend which will allow you to measure product quality resulting from from the production line before it's packaged and shipped to the customer the next set of kpis relate to your delivery process which are number one your unit delivery cost trend which enables you to validate your cost reduction hypothesis number two your missed on time delivery rate trend which tracks your ability to deliver your product units or finished goods to your paying customer within the promised time frame and finally the last two kpis relate to your solution adoption process which are number one your product rating trend which measures how your customer values your solution after first use and number two your percentage of orders reviewed which determines customer satisfaction and passion related to your product or service now don't worry if you didn't catch all these as i'm going to go through each one more in depth as we review the activities to each to each of these through the milestones okay the controls available to you for managing the speed of your production delivery engine or are as follows they're pretty simple number one your unit sales demand forecast what this means is that you have a lead engine and sales engine that's working efficiently so you can forecast how many units your production delivery and engine will need to produce so as to meet demand and number two your production and delivery capacity well again this is self-evident this means that you have access to production and or delivery capacity which enables you to generate enough supply to match customer demand and finally number three capital spending again self-evident this means that you have the funding resources to adjust production capacity based on your sales demand forecast now before we dive into the activities we recommend to build your production delivery engine let's take a moment to consider a common alternative approach many entrepreneurs follow related to producing and delivering their solution the most common alternative approach we encounter comes from entrepreneurs who tell us the following hey shafiq steven guys why should we bother with working out how to produce and deliver our own solution when we just found this terrific manufacturing partner and they have it all under control plus we sell our products through amazon so we don't need to worry about any delivery and product product adoption issues sure why not right lots of companies outsource some part of the part of their business so why shouldn't you do the same i mean do you really need to be masters in all of your domains i mean that doesn't seem super efficient so this question seems completely reasonable a few of you may even be nodding along because you've thought of the same question yourself well here's the reason why outsourcing doesn't work when building your production delivery engine first you have to work out an efficient manufacturing process otherwise your ability to negotiate pricing will be severely limited due to waste and poor cost insight for example you won't be able to question why a producer manufacturer is estimating that your finished goods cost three times higher than materials cost also if your manufacturing partner captures all the margin you'll be left with little or no margin to run the business secondly when it comes to the delivery side for physical goods many of the issues can be handled working with a logistics partner now this is not true for digital or software products you must repeatedly perform enough implementations to ensure you understand the pitfalls associated with customer adoption during the delivery step leaving this step to your implementation partners from the beginning is a recipe for disaster as you become removed from observing and understanding the issues your customers are facing during a critical early phase of your startup if you're not sure if this is true let's look at a case study of a very famous startup that nearly failed now normally when we examine case studies we like to look at those that actually did fail because more publicly available information exists to analyze and understand the mistakes made in this case we're fortunate to have a founder who's unusually transparent about the struggles being experienced in real time as well as the fixes that had to be made for this case study let's talk about my favorite founder elon musk and tesla's production delivery engine related to the model 3. on march 31st 2016 elon introduced tesla's first production electric vehicle targeting the masses with an estimated price range of thirty five thousand to fifty thousand dollars pre-order pre-ordering was opened immediately with a goal of the first cars being delivered in early 2017. within a couple days nearly 500 000 customers had placed a 1 000 refundable uh pre-order deposit and tesla knew it has runaway hit on its hands think about lead engine check sales engine check production delivery engine prior to the model 3 announcement tesla produced approximately 65 000 cars over its five-year history since the launch of the model s in 2012. that's nearly one-tenth of the 500 000 pre-orders that occurred within two weeks of the model 3's announcements however elon had a plan to ramp up production to a level tesla had never achieved he'd use a highly automated production line compared to the much manual much more manual production process that had existed with the model s and the x at that point this is where the challenges begun while tesla had technically sophisticated team and electric vehicles have substantially fewer parts compared to the to a traditional industrial internal combustion engine based car tesla had not previously implemented an automated production line to the extent required to meet model 3 demand not only did tesla need to acquire and install the automation equipment it had to make runs through the production process to ensure production quality and remove unnecessary complexity as elon tweeted tesla was in production hell all this was occurring under the bright light of bright spotlight of media scrutiny along with the pressure that comes from being a public company which happened to be the most shorted stock meaning loads and loads of active investors were betting against the company and gleefully spreading rumors as they hoped the company would fail effectively speaking these short sellers were tesla's indirect competitors who wanted to drive customers away to other brands but that's not all once tesla started to solve its production problem and new problem surface that still had to be addressed delivery or more specifically as elon said we've gone from production hell to delivery logistics help whether you're delivering a digital solution that requires a ramp up in servers that so that your users can have an uninterrupted experience or a physical product that has to be shipped to your customers before they can enjoy their purchase delivery is an easily overlooked challenge for a new product team tesla had thousands upon thousands of vehicles coming off the production line in fremont california that had to be delivered to individual customers across the country and once again the shorts were more than happy to cause trouble by alleging that many tesla pre-orders had been cancelled and these brand new model 3s were being held to cover up for plummeting customer demand now all this was not true but the short sellers hoped they would scare off existing pre-orders and future buyers so that the company would fail with all of this pressure to satisfy customer demand to repeatably produce and deliver a product that they had never built before what would you expect elon musk to do to manage customer expectations and keep his team motivated to achieve the critical goal of a proven production and delivery engine when it comes to building a production delivery engine for your product or service you need to have a plan in place to measure whether you're on track with hitting your goal or not to measure your progress we use a technique called okr which stands for objective and key results it's a framework for setting and measuring goals as well as the results of the activities to achieve them for this third milestone a production delivery engine built we've designed a 60-day okay okr that keeps you focused on completing the activities necessary to finish the milestone within two months the key results correspond directly with your progress on the underlying work plan so let's review what your execution cycle should be since we've already done all the hard work by building a production got our project guide i'll use this as a reference point for this episode now the key aspect is as you begin each activity you need to plan your work so they can be completed in manageable bite-sized chunks this prevents the feeling of being overwhelmed in the work ahead or discouraged when you encounter a small setback once you've made your activity plan then using the framework tools and process guides that i'm about to cover you'll work on each activity in orderly manner which will keep you focused and on target after completing all the activities for a given milestone you need to schedule time to review your results with an advisor your advisor can help you with a fresh pair of eyes to and to quickly analyze whether you've correctly built your production and delivery engine or not in this last step of your execution cycle you need to evaluate whether your idea suffers from a fatal flaw related to your product assumption if you have advisors who are well-versed in lean methodologies then they should be able to help you perform this analysis and if not you can contact myself or shafiq for help with this by the way it may seem redundant to perform a fatal flaw analysis during the second startup phase related to product consumption when you already perform this during market validation well as we learned with elon and tesla this fatal flaw analysis is focused on the automation aspect of your product assumption which is something you weren't concerned with before as your previous activities were manual in nature okay now that you understand how to proceed using a project guide let's quickly look at the detailed activities for repeatable sales and delivery's third milestone production and delivery engine built to successfully achieve the production and delivery engine built milestone you'll complete the following four activities once again let's look at each activity in detail the first activity is about defining your production delivery process which helps you set up a consistent method for producing and delivering your product while improving product quality leading to higher product adoption there are four deliverables you need to accomplish that effectively represent some processes the first deliverable is to define the planning process the planning process consists of five key steps now speak and i are often asked why do i need to plan i have digital products whether you're in the news publishing business or have your own youtube channel or make software apps you need to plan your production schedule the process for digital products starts by thinking about the frequency of publishing new versions as well as the amount of changes you'll introduce in each new version take this example see on cnn.com they publish your content every hour and can introduce breaking news off cycle microsoft on the other hand updates their os every month and sometimes several times if there are security issues that require urgent fixes therefore planning the change process of digital content is no different than planning to produce physical products for physical products you start by determining if you're going to choose a direct or indirect production model for the direct model you need to execute the following five steps number one you'll identify your batch production costs as in labor and materials you'll also inc this will also include identifying vendors for sourcing raw materials number two you'll identify your raw material lead times number three you'll develop your capital investment budget per your your capital investment budget per unit of capacity number four you're you're using your testing unit sale selling price from your sales engine you'll calculate the product margin per unit by subtracting your unit cost from unit sale selling price and number five in the last step of planning you'll develop a cost and time reduction strategy on a unit production basis in the early part of planning you'll want to develop these strategies before each production run and implement them during the next strategy the the next patch run to determine if your strategy provides you the results you hypothesize for the indirect model you'll execute four key steps number one you'll solicit bids for manufacturing partners and determine a minimum batch size as well as any unit volume discounts number two you'll determine the minimum production batch size and lead times which help you determine the working capital required number three using your tested unit selling price you can calculate the product margin per unit by subtracting your unit costs from your unit selling price and number four in the last step of planning you'll develop a cost and time reduction strategy on a per unit of production basis once again in the early part of planning even using an indirect model you'll want to develop strategies before each production run and implement them during the next batch run to determine if your strategy provide you the results you hypothesize now the second deliverable is to define your production process the production process consists of itself of four steps the first step is to define the unit production steps with an appropriate quality assurance method or qa at each step some of you may be familiar with how to define the steps of production and maybe wondering why you need to qa perform quality assurance after each step well it's pretty easy if you don't ensure that each step is completed correctly then the future steps will likely fail depending on the interdependency between the steps even if there's no dependency your final product has a high likelihood of failure without incorporating a qa process to validate the production quality by testing each step you're able to quickly eliminate cascading issues as well as the ability to find the root cause of issues when you detect a quality issue at the end of production the second step is when you define production packaging requirements this is where you have to worry about compliance issues for labeling as well as ensuring that your customer finds it easy to understand how to use your product so for example did you know that when tesla shipped its first cars to china they had to sit in a port because they had the wrong sticker on them from compliance purposes tesla literally had to fly someone out back to china with the right sticker and then manually replace each one before the port authority would release the cars for delivery and by the way this is all the while that's cash flow tied up in inventory and revenue that can't be recognized while a simple sticker issue gets solved now one of the one other thing to remember is that it's important to include inserts in your product which helps support the sales process this can include requests for reviews and referrals because actually asking for reviews will help support your organic growth customers won't necessarily take that action without your prompting you have to recognize that within them the third step is when you define the post-production qa process once again it's extremely important to have to have defined the production the post-production qa process before beginning in this step you're ensuring that you be that you can find any defects in your product before your customer finds them the cost of delivering a defective product is disproportionately high in terms of loss of reputation and erosion of margin think of this as a consumer yourself you kind of expect the products or service you use to work when you receive them and deliver on the promise that you bought the fourth step is when you establish your production quality issues tracking log the log will help you track trends in the production process by logging defect rate and tracking customer issues you can quickly determine if your production process is helping you deliver on the promise made during the sales cycle without a planning a plan tracking tool you're not developing the organization discipline necessary to grow as you're only responding to anecdotal issues now let's move on to the third deliverable in activity number one which is when you define the delivery process the delivery process consists of two key steps first off you need to once again identify which product delivery model you'll use direct or indirect for the direct model you'll take the following five key steps number one you'll identify your delivery costs in terms of labor and materials which includes identifying the vendors for sourcing raw materials as your delivery packaging may need these number two you'll identify any raw material lead times number three you'll develop your capital investment budget for each unit of delivery capacity number four you may need to revise your product margin per unit calculation if you're not able to pass along the delivery cost of your product to your customers and number five similar to the production planning phase you'll want to deliver to develop a cost and time reduction strategy per delivery unit for the indirect model you'll need to execute four steps number one you'll identify unit delivery costs in terms of labor and materials which once again includes identifying vendors for sourcing raw materials number two you'll identify raw material time the raw material time lead times as necessary number three you'll calculate your product margin per unit and number four you'll develop your cost and time reduction strategy per unit production now the second step of this deliverable is when you define your post delivery qa process here you have cons you're concerned with measuring the safe delivery of your product in the hands of your customer key measures are related to tracking and measuring any damage caused during transportation as well as any damage caused due to packaging you will log these issues to properly monitor and fix them the last deliverable in the defined production and delivery process is to define the adoption process for your product service using the user's product adoption journey the portion in this specifically the portion you're concerned with starts after the product has been delivered and the user opens a box with a pure digital solution this is where the user first uses the app or views the new story or video depending on what your startup focuses on now if you're not familiar with the user's product adoption journey we covered this in depth during the market validation phase of building your startup but i'll cover some key elements of it here as well to define the process you'll ensure that the user is able to travel the user adoption journey easily and without encountering any issues that would derail or frustrate them the adoption process starts when the user opens the box at this point your customer is concerned with how quickly they can start using your solution and whether you'll be able to they'll be able to easily access the value your product or service promises the next concern your customer has relates to how self-evident it'll be to get your product or service working for them remember we're not we're no longer the era of thick user manuals we as consumers expect to be able to use a product or service quickly after purchasing it for consumer products or services you need to know can the user experience the value that was promised within the first five minutes for b2b products or services it may take a little longer for the user but it can't feel like forever they have to feel like they're making progress along the way nearly just as important how long will it take your customer to register the product to act or to activate a warranty you want your customer to know that you stand behind your solution and that you're there to address any issues that could come up to support rapid improvement of your product or service you must regularly survey new and existing users so you can help them provide you feedback on how the product is performing as they use it also to support organic growth and reduce the cost of sales you must make it easy for your customer to provide you feedback that can be easily shared on public sites even better to reduce the cost of lead generation you must make it easy for your customers to refer your product or service to their colleagues or friends remember your satisfied customer will know others who can benefit from your solution and their trusted referral shorts the buying process for new customers the second activity in the production and delivery engine is when you validate the production and delivery process that you just defined the first activity wasn't just a paper exercise like a business plan or financial projections no the validation activity helps you ensure ensure that your instrumentation of the process is working that you can understand any issues within the process and that your process actually works the validation activity requires you to instrument and validate each sub process once again you have four deliverables you need to accomplish which map to the deliverables you just completed so the first deliverable is to validate the production and planning process you can only validate portions of the plan after you achieve critical milestones for example in the direct model you'll need to set up your production facility and install all the necessary equipment to support production only after you've completed that and ordered your raw materials will you be able to validate the working capital budget as well as the capital investment budget whichever model you'll use you'll also need to validate your cost reduction and production volume hypothesis to measure the effectiveness of your cost reduction and production volume hypothesis you'll track the variance between budget versus actual for both unit cost and needed volume trends the variance trend will help you validate your hypothesis you will look at what to do when you are unable to drive down costs and increase volume during the fatal flaw analysis later in this workshop the next deliverable in the second activity of building your production delivery engine is to validate the production process here you're trying to measure the unit production trend in a given time frame and the product defect rate in the same time frame your goal is to drive up unit volume while decreasing the defect rate to validate the delivery process you're going to measure the unit delivery cost and the missed on-time delivery rate in both cases you want to drive those metrics down finally you'll want to validate the adoption process here the metrics you're going to track are the product rating trend and the percentage of orders that get reviewed the third activity to achieve the production delivery engine milestone is to optimize your engine by optimizing the production delivery engine you'll be confident you can efficiently produce and deliver your product once again you're using four similar deliverables comprising each of the sub processes when optimizing your first focus is on speeding up the process once you've done that you'll have a clear work plan that leads you to your second focus which is decreasing your cost now if you'd like to learn more about optimization strategies we have some terrific tools for you to use during in our lean mastery incubator now before continuing i want to take a moment to acknowledge a pattern that you're likely that you likely have recognized in how to build this engine yes the pattern is related to how iterative the effort actually is imagine wanting to get to the top of force of a four-story building sure you could try to parkour your way to the top which is what most entrepreneurs seem to want to do why not looks fun except for the falling part instead the responsible way to get to your goal is to climb a ladder now not only is it safer but it's easier and quicker because you know the path you need to follow plus you can easily measure your progress as you travel to reach your goal the iterative nature of building your production delivery engine is simply about climbing a ladder by safely completing each activity one step at a time now before moving to the fatal flaw analysis for this milestone during activity number four you'll analyze the results from these preceding activities by answering the following questions that tie to your okrs those questions are can i repeatedly produce and deliver my product can i mod the performance of my production delivery engine can i control the volume and cost of operating my production delivery engine now if you've answered yes to each of these three questions then you'll proceed to the next milestone of the scale feasibility validated to achieve the production and delivery engine build milestone once again it'll take approximately two months so let's now look at how to fix the issues with that when we cannot answer these questions in the affirmative affirmative by performing our fatal flaw analysis if you're unfamiliar with the common fatal flaws for a startup there are five of them related to your startup's key business assumptions we covered all five fatal flaws during the market validation process so during the repeatable sales and delivery startup development phase we only focus on fatal flaws number two through five since fatal flaw number one only really comes up during market validation this means that we need to perform a deeper level of fatal flaw analysis to reflect new information related to systematizing your key business functions so to quickly review the second fatal flaw relates to your lead engine and your third fatal flaw relates to your sales engine so this brings us to the fourth beta flaw when the value your solution delivers is not unique your product idea suffers from this fourth beta flaw if you're unable to consistently produce and deliver a product within with unique value if your defect rate is above 10 with no effective means of lowering it then your solution suffers from this flaw the cause is usually related to either the process or the underlying technology being used to produce your product when you fail this test condition with a product defect rate above 10 then you will need to redesign the production process or your product to address quality and efficiency challenges so on that note let's return to our recent real life example of a company that overcome overcame the speed of law using exactly this corrective action so going back to tesla when tesla began to deliver its first model threes famed automotive benchmarking veteran sandy monroe was able to get his hands on one see sandy is a tear-down expert and that his firm will examine the production build for quality and cost by literally tearing down the product to its parts well needless to say sandy's report was scathing and widely reported with the help of short sellers of course his key comment was i can't imagine how they released this well the tesla team was prepared though by implementing the corrective action for fatal flaw number four the first step that elon musk had taken was to merge leadership of his engineering and production teams to better respond to production defects and speed up implementation of necessary product design changes the second step that tesla took was to slow down deliveries to allow sufficient time for quality assurance testing during the production process as well as after final assembly this meant this meant managing customer expectations related to further delays while also tolerating unexpected costs related to rework when products failed the new quality assurance standards the third step for tesla was to keep communicating delivery status as it anticipated addressing its next problem related to delays in service and part supply taking those corrective actions wasn't easy as elon musk was famously sleeping the fact at the factory because he needed to devote all of his focus to take his company through production and delivery health but the results of taking these corrective actions paid off as sandy monroe performed a second tear down after design changes were implemented for the production process as well as with the model 3's design itself sandy came away impressed by the quality improvements along with the remarkable 30 profit margin that competing automakers could not match so in the end tesla made it through hell with its customer pre-orders intact along with impressive customer adoption and retention results additionally it had converted an important critic into a fan that turned his expertise into explaining why all of those short sellers were wrong as they were intentionally using inaccurate data the difference between success and failure in this story is that tesla lives the lean startup approach to building its products which was the intentional design intentionally designed into the companies cultured by its founder elon musk matter of fact we can be confident that elon possesses two superpowers that are directly related to his lean mastery because we see these abilities replicated as other startups such as spacex hyperloop openai neuralink the boring company and lords lord knows what else he's going to think of by the way these are all skills that he honed during his first startups of zip2 and paypal so what are the startup the startup superpowers well elon's first superpower is his ability to understand who are his early adopters and the compelling problem those first customers once solved his second superpower is his ability to understand what the first version of a solution needs to be to solve those early adopters compelling problem and not to overreach for more but here's the thing elon doesn't actually have superpowers nor is he an alien he's just a smart guy who has the wisdom to build lean startups which is something any one of us can master because doing it any other way leads you to some place worse than startup purgatory okay during our next workshop we're going to examine the fourth repeatable sales and delivery milestone where you'll validate your scale hypothesis so as to ensure that your automated key activities are ready for sustainable growth when you scale your business operations r d processes and support capabilities we'll also identify the activities you need to perform and the tools you'll use so you can efficiently complete this final milestone of the repeatable sales and delivery phase
