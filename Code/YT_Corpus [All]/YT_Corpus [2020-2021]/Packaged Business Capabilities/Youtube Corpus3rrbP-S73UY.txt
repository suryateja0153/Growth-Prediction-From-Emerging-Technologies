 from around the globe it's the cube with digital coverage of Red Hat summit 2020 brought to you by Red Hat hi I'm Stu Mittleman and this is the cubes coverage of a Red Hat summit 2020 happening digitally we're connecting with Red Hat executives thought leaders practitioners wherever they are around the globe bringing them remotely into this online event happy to welcome back to the program Joe Fernandez who's the vice president and general manager of core cloud platforms with Red Hat Joe thanks so much for joining us yeah thanks for having me glad to be here all right so so Joe you know cloud of course has been a conversation we've been having for a lot of years when I went to Red Hat summit last year when I went to IBM think last year there's discussion of moving from kind of chapter one if you will to chapter two some of the labels that we put on things back in the early days like hybrid cloud and multi cloud they're coming into a little bit clearer picture so let's just give a high level what you're seeing from your customers when they talk about hybrid and multi cloud environment you know what does that mean that your customers and therefore how is Red Hat meeting them where they are yeah sure so Red Hat obviously serves an enterprise customer base and you know what we've seen in that customer base really since the start and it's really informed our strategy is the fact that you know all their applications aren't going to run in one place right so they're really employing a hybrid cloud strategy a hybrid and multi cloud strategy that spans from their data centers out to a public cloud typically then out to multiple public clouds as their cloud investments grow as they move more applications and now even out to the edge for many of those customers so that's the the newest footprint that we're getting asked about so really we think of that as the open hybrid cloud and you know our goal is really to provide a consistent platform for applications regardless of where they run across all those environments yeah let's look down a second on that because we've heard consistency for quite a while if you look at the largest cloud provider out there they said you know hybrid environment will give you the exact same hardware that we're running in the public cloud and will put you know that in your environment of course red hats a software company you've lived across lots of platforms for you know red hats entire existence so you know where is that consistency needed how do you think about how Red Hat does things maybe the same and a little different than some of the other players that are been you know positioning and even repositioning their hybrid story over the last year or so yeah so we're really excited to see you know a lot of folks in the industry including all the major public cloud providers are now talking about hybrid and talking about these types of initiatives that we've been you know talking about for quite some time but it's a little bit different when we talk about hybrid cloud when we talk about multi cloud we're talking about being able to run not just in one public cloud and then in an on-premise appliance you know that mirrors that cloud we're really talking about being able to run across multiple clouds so having that consistency across you know running in say Amazon to Azure to Google and then carrying that into your on-premise environments whether that's on bare metal on VMware on OpenStack and then like I said out out to the edge right so that consistency is important for people who are concerned about how their applications are going to operate in these different environments because otherwise they'll have to manage that those differences themselves um speaking as part of Red Hat right this is this is what the company was built on right in the you know 20 years ago is all about Linux bringing consistency for enterprise applications running across x86 hardware right so regardless of who your om vendor was as long as you were building to the x86 standard and leveraging Linux as a base Red Hat Enterprise Linux became that same consistent operating environment for applications which is important for our software vendors but also more importantly for customers themselves as they you know those apps into production yeah I guess uh you know last question I have for kind of just the the landscape out there we've been talking for a number of years when you talk to practitioners they don't get caught up in the labor that we use in the industry you know do they have a cloud strategy yes most companies have a cloud strategy and if you ask them it's their cloud strategy to say today same today as it was a quarter ago or a year ago they say of course not everything's changed we know in today's day and age what I was doing a month ago is probably very different from what I am doing today so I know you've got a survey that was done of enterprise users I saw it when it came out a month ago and you know some good data in there so you know where are we and you know what what data do you have to share with us on kind of the customer adoption where we're going yes I think you know we put out a survey not too long ago and we showed as I think over 60 percent of customers were you know we're adopting a hybrid cloud strategy exactly as I described you know thinking about their applications in terms of an environment that spans multiple cloud infrastructures as well as on-premise footprints and then you know going beyond that we we think that number will grow based on you know what we saw in that survey that just mirrors the conversations that I've had with customers that many of us here at Red Hat have been having with those same customers over the years because you know everybody is in a different spot in terms of their you know transformation efforts in terms of their adoption of cloud technologies and what it means for their business so we need to meet customers where they're at understand that everybody's at a different spot and then make sure that they we can help them make that transition and it's really an evolution as opposed to I think with some people that past might have thought of as a revolution where all the data centers are going to shut down and everything's going to move all at once and so helping customers evolve and you know that transition is really what Red Hat's all about yeah and so often Joanne when I talked to some of the vendors out there and you talk about hybrid you talk about multi cloud it's talking about something you mentioned it's a box it's a place it's you know the infrastructure discussion but you know when I've been having conversation with a lot of your peers these interviews for red hat summit we know that you know it's the organization and it's the applications that are hugely important as these changes go and happen so talk a little bit about that what's happening in the organization how are you helping the infrastructure team keep up and the app dev team you know move forward yeah so so first I start with that on the technology side right one of the things that that has enabled this type of consistency and portability has been sort of the advent of Linux containers as a standard packaging format that can span across all these front foot prints right so we know that Linux runs in all these different footprints and Linux containers as a portable packaging format enables that and then kubernetes enables customers to work a straight containers at scale and so that's that's really what OpenShift is focused on is delivering an enterprise kubernetes platform again spanning all these environments that leverages container based packaging provides enterprise kubernetes orchestration and management to manage in all those environments what that then also does on the people front is bring you know infrastructure and operations teams together it because you know kubernetes containers represents agility for both sides right or application developers it represents the ability to their application and all their dependencies and know that when they run it in one environment it'll be consistent with how it runs in other environments so eliminating that problem of works on my machine but doesn't work you know in prod or what have you so it brings consistency for developers for infrastructure teams it gives them the ability to to basically make decisions around where the best places to run these applications without having to you know think about that from a from a technology perspective but really from things that should matter more like cost and convenience to customers and performance and so forth so so you know I think we see those teams coming together that being said it is an evolution in people and process and culture so we've done a lot of work we launched a global transformation office we had previously launched Red Hat open innovation labs and have done a lot of work with our consulting services to help and our partners as well to help with sort of the people and process evolutions that need to occur to adopt you know these types of technologies as well as to move towards a more cloud native approach all right so Joe what one of the announcements made it made at the show is talking about how openshift is working with virtualization so you know I think back to the earliest container days there was discussion of oh you know docker in containers it kills VM or you know cloud of course you know some cloud services run on VMs other run on containers there's herbalists so there's a lot of confusion out there as to yeah you know what happened we know an IT no technology ever dies everything is always additive it's figuring out the right solutions and and the right fit so help us understand what Red Hat is doing when it comes to virtualization and open chips and kubernetes and how's your approach different than some of what we've already seen in the marketplace yeah so so definitely we've seen just explosive adoption of containers technology right which has driven the open ship business and Red Hat's business over also so we expect that to continue right more applications moving towards a container based packaging and deployment model and leveraging kubernetes and an open shift to manage those environments but that being said as you mentioned virtualization has been around for a really long time right and predominantly most applications today are running virtualized and so some of them have made the transition to containers or were built a container native from the start but many more are still running in VM based environments and and may never make that switch so what we were looking at is how do we manage this sort of hybrid environment from the application perspective where you have some applications running in containers other applications running in VMs we have platforms like Red Hat OpenStack Red Hat virtualization that leveraged the KVM hypervisor and Red Hat Enterprise Linux to serve apps running in a VM based environment what we did with kubernetes is he said how could we innovate to have convergence on the orchestration and management run and we leverage the fact that KVM are you are chosen hypervisor is actually a Linux process that can itself be containerized and so by running hypervisor in a container we can then spawn VMs that could be managed on that same platform as the containers run so what you have in open ship virtualization is the ability to use kubernetes to manage containerized workloads as well as standard VM based workloads and this is these are full the amps these aren't micro VMs or you know things like a firecracker caught a container these are standard VMs that could be full windows guests or Linux guests running inside those VMs and so it helps you basically you know manage that type of environment where you may be moving to containers and more cloud native approach but you those containers need to interact or you know work with applications they're still in a VM based deployment environment and we think it's really exciting we've demoed it at the last Red Hat Summit we're gonna talk about it even more here in terms of how we're gonna bring those products to market and enable customers ok yeah children let me make sure I understand this because as you said it is a different approach so number one if I'm moving towards a container management solution this is gonna fit natively into what I'm doing it's not taking you know some of my traditional management tools and saying oh I also get some visibility in containers that's more you know here's my kubernetes solution and just some of those containers happen to be virtualized did I get that piece right yeah I think it's more like so we know that kubernetes is gonna be in in the in the environment because we know that yeah people are moving application workloads to you know standard Linux containers but we also know that virtual machines are going to still exist in that environment so you can think about it as how would we enable kubernetes to manage a virtual machine in the same way that it manages a Linux container and what we do there is we actually put the VM inside the container right so because the VM specifically you know with idiom is just a Linux process and that's what a Linux container is it's it's a Linux process right so you can you can run the hypervisor spawn the virtual machines inside of containers but those virtual machines you know are just like any other VM that would run in in OpenStack or Red Hat virtualization or what have you and you could vSphere for example so those are traditional virtual machines that are now being managed in a kubernetes environment and what we're seeing is sort of this evolution of kubernetes to take on these new types of workloads VMs is just one example of something that you can now manage with your days okay and help me understand what this means to really the app dev in my application portfolio because you know the original promise of virtualization was I can just stick my application in a VM and I never need to think about it ever again and well that was super helpful when Windows NT was going end-of-life in 2020 we do find that most companies do want to update their applications and they are talking about do i refactor them do I make them micro services architecture I don't want to have that iceberg of an application that I'm just dragging along slowly into the new world so yeah what is what is this virtualization integration with kubernetes you mean for the octave and the applications yeah sure so what we see customers doing when we see their application development teams doing is modernizing a lot of their existing applications right so they're taking traditional monolithic applications or entir type applications that may run in a VM based environment and they're moving them towards more of a distributed architecture leveraging you know micro services based approach but that doesn't happen all at once either right so so oftentimes what you see is your micro services are still you know connected to VM based applications or make maybe you're breaking down a monolithic application the core is still running in a VM but some of those business functions have now been carved out in containerized so you know you're gonna end up in a hybrid environment from the application perspective in terms of how these applications are packages and deployed the question is what does that mean for your deployment architecture does it mean you always have to run a virtualization platform and a container platform together that's how it's done today right openshift and kubernetes run on top of vSphere they were on top of Amazon and Azure and Google VMs on top of OpenStack but what if you could actually just run kubernetes directly on bare metal and manage both types of workloads that's really this was the idea that that you know our open ship virtualization solution was based on is let's just you know manage VMs natively with kubernetes in the same way that we manage containers and then you know it can facilitate for the application developer this evolution of apps that are running in one environment towards an absolute running essentially in a hybrid environment from how they're packaged and deploy yeah absolutely something I've been hearing for the last year or so that that hybrid deployment pulling apart application sometimes it's even you know that core piece as you said is on-premises and then I might have some of the more transactional pieces happening in the public cloud so really interesting so you know how long has Red Hat been working on this my understanding for something you know I'm familiar with and in the CNC F believe it's been around for a couple of years so talk to us about this kind of how long it took to get here and you know fully support stateful applications now what's what's the overall roadmap look like yeah so so convert as a open-source project was launched more than two years ago now and as you know Red Hat really drives all of our development upstream in the open source community so we launched a new project we've been collaborating with other vendors and even customers on that um but then you know over time we then decide you know how do we bring these technologies to market which technologies make sense to bring to market so so Cooper is the open source project open ship and open ship virtualization which is you know what this feature is is referred to commercially is the product that then we would ship and support for running these and in production environments the capabilities right so so I think those have been evolving as well so virtual machines have specific requirements in terms of not only how they're deployed and managed but how they connect to storage how they connect networking I how do you do things like fencing and you know all sorts of live migration and that type of thing we've been building out those types of capabilities they'll certainly still more to do there but it's something that we're really excited about not just from the perspective of running VMs but just even more broadly from the perspective of how kubernetes is expanding to take on new workloads right because kubernetes has moved far beyond just running you know how native applications today you can run stateful services in containers you can run things like a I machine learning and analytics and IOT type services and so but it hasn't come for free right that this has come through a lot of hard work in the kubernetes community in the various associated communities the container communities communities like uber but it's all kind of trying to leverage that same automation that same platform to just do more things and the cool thing is not just it does not just be Red Hat talking about it but you'll you'll see that from a lot of customers that are doing sessions at our summit this year and beyond talking about how what it means to them yeah that's great always love hearing the practitioner viewpoint all right Joe I want to give you the final word when it comes to this whole space things kind of moved pretty fast but also we remember it when we first saw it so it was what customers were kind of walking away from Red Hat summit 2020 should be looking at an understanding that they might not have thought about if they were looking at kubernetes a year or two ago yeah I think couple of things one is you know kubernetes and this whole container because ecosystem is continuing to evolve continuing to add capabilities and continue to expand the types of workloads that that it can run Red Hat is right in the center of it it's all happening in open source Red Hat as a leading contributor to kubernetes and open source in general is driving a lot of this innovation we're working with some great customers and partners other vendors who working side-by-side with us as well and I think you know the most important thing is under we understand that it's an evolution for customers right so this evolution towards moving applications to the public cloud adopting a hybrid cloud approach this evolution in terms of expanding the types of workloads and how you run and manage them and that approach is something that you know we've always helped customers through and we're doing that today as they move out towards towards embracing cloud native all right well Joe Fernandez thank you so much for the updates congratulations on the launch of open shift virtualization definitely look forward to talking to some of the customers and finding out that helping them along their hybrid cloud journey all right lots more coverage from the cube at Red Hat Summit I'm Stu minimun and thank you for watching the Q
