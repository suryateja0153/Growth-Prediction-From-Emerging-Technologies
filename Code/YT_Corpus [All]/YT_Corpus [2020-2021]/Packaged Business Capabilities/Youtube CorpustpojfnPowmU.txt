 hi everyone welcome to enterprise manager product training series this recording presents product demonstration of oracle real user experience insight my name is yutaka takatsu i am one of the product managers in enterprise manager product management team so real user experience insight or ruei in short is an enterprise manager family product and this is a passive monitoring tool and captures all the end user activities in your application so it allows you to see what the users are doing your application and monitors the performance from the end user perspectives so let's start from knowing what questions ruei can answer at the left hand side of the screen we have is an internal business application and there is an i.t administrator who managed the application and say there was a page error so users of this application could not load the page they called up the administrator about this problem however the administrator could not reproduce a problem in his end so he is wondering what exactly was the error which the users were seeing another example now we have an online shopping website that is publicly opened through the internet and there is a business application owner wondering how many customers actually came to my store in the last 24 hours and what percentage of them actually purchased my product so these are the questions that ruei can answer an it administrator can see the full session report of what exactly happened during the error time he can further diagnose the issue using jvm diagnostics feature in enterprise manager and drill down to the root cause and business application owner can see the traffic statistics and based on the kpi threshold he can raise an alert and receive email notification so this is a high level introduction on what questions ruei can answer next let's see this in the actual product so what i have here is the enterprise manager 13.4 opening my screen and here is the page that shows ruei monitoring and application and this is the business application which we use for demo purpose but the monitoring capabilities which ruei provides are generic to any application so either that is a homegrown or packaged application that you are to monitor with ruei what you see in this demo is generally applicable so you can expect a similar experience regardless of the types of applications so what we can see in this dashboard there is a top user section at the lower left side of the screen so here i have five users with each having 120 to 170 sessions in the last two hours and this table also has average page load time and also the total percentage of violations for each user and violations in ruei terminology is basically the alerts so this can be in an application side issue such as server error or network failure or it can be an issue based on the user experience such as when the user aborted the page load or when they received contact notifications so those are considered as violations and going to show up here and at the upper side of the screen there is key performance indicator section so there are three kpi metrics configured for this application and currently two of them are showing threshold violations the first metric is online store p95 so this is a metric that monitors page load time in 95 percentile so what this is measuring is the page load time but excluding the spikes or unusual page load time the second metric here is search page load time in greater than six seconds so this is a metric that alerts me when there are certain number of page hits that are having page load time going beyond 6 seconds and the third metric here is completed flows rate so this measures the percentage of user flow completion and reports violations if the percentage of the user abort exceeds the threshold value and the kpi is a metric alerting mechanism in ruei so you can set threshold to raise an alert in enterprise managers incident management framework and that is what you see in the incident section which you see at the upper left side of the screen and there are two incidents raised in the past two hours and that is likely coming from the kpi violations that you see in adjacent kpi section and this dashboard is currently showing the data for the last two hours of the activities went on with this particular application but you can change the time range to show a longer period such as 24 hours or one week or you can show the historical data so you can say how was the performance of my server a week ago from 9 00 am to 10 am for example also it takes five minutes for ruei to aggregate data and show it up to the ui but you can configure the data collection frequency on your preference you can also see where the users are coming from so that is the map view showing at the lower right hand side of the screen and i can see most of the users accessing my application from us but i also see some users are coming from europe as well and i can drill down to see the bigger map of europe so now i can see we have user access from spain and sweden i'm not sure which country this is in the central part of europe but i can hover my mouse and see the till tip so this is hungary and we had 864 page views from here and i can actually further narrow down to see which regions they are coming from within the country so looks like the users are in the central part of the country and that is the city of the budapest and in the center of the screen at the lower side there is a multi-level pie chart this is the usage and violation overview section and this image is the presentation of all the pages that are accessed in the last two hours so the center of the circle is application layer which is the wine cellar application that consists 100 of the page views so i have 11 550 page views in total and 2274 are having some kind of violations i can see the breakdown in a table view which is showing in the right hand side of the same section and the area next to it is the page groups here is the online store that consists most of the page views and the outer layer shows the pages here i click the line search which has the largest number of clicks and as i click the chart table view also gets updated so this page has 1775 application site violations and also 104 user site violations and i can also see three server errors and i can further drill down to see the instance level details by clicking the metrics link here i can see the access details for this specific page which is the wine search so looking at this first row user id is ng user 27 here is the time accessed and here is how long it took which is 90 seconds and the list is sorted by the time bar column so this seems to be the slowest page during the last two hours and i see the client abort which means the user did not wait to complete the page load which makes sense because it was taking 19 seconds and i have so many of them here with the senior experience so something was causing the slowdown of this page and the search section has filters already pre-configured but you can add other filters to further narrow down the list so i recall there were a few server errors showing up in the dashboard view how can i see them what i can do is to add a new field in the search section to filter the view for the server errors in specific so i'm going to select add fields scroll down and select the server errors now i have a new field for server errors and this will search for the number of server errors for instance so i'm going to put the number zero here and redo the search now i see three entries that are having internal server errors i'm going to click the camera icon to see the replay data and this will open an external window so here you can see the request headers and response editor information also the response content and you can set up content notification alerts against this information so you can configure to search for a specific text within the headers or the contents so for example you can search for the string internal server error and when it is detected you can configure to send an alert message to you and this is raw html but you can also see the rendered html by clicking on the replay view so this is the page that was actually shown to the user going back close the external window so i could see the http details next i want to do is to see the thread level information so i'm going to expand the first row and click the icon in the info section and what this allows you to do is to click out to java workload explorer page so i can see one filter added to this page and i know this is the execution context id which was passed on by ruei in order to show the relevant data let me adjust the time range to two hours and here you go so this is a jvm information for the thread that ended up in the server error so i can see by the color which is purple that was waiting for the network resource next i want to see what method that was invoked so i can do this by clicking the method tab in the toolbar and here is the method information that is related to the server error we just saw and i can further see the call stack information to see which file the method resides i'm going to select action view call trees i also want to see the line number so click this as well scroll down and here shows the file name and line number information of that method okay so that was java workload explorer which is integrated with ruei and provides diagnostic information so i'm going back to the ruei page so we are back in the ruei dashboard page next i would like to do is to see the incidents as mentioned kpi metrics are the alerting mechanism in ruei and you can configure to set thresholds to them and you can generate the em events out of them so the incident section at the upper left side of the screen i have two warning incidents created for this performance category and this is because i have set two of the kpis to raise warning alerts upon crossing the threshold so i can click the number and this will bring me to open the incident page in enterprise manager for this particular application and here i have two incidents raised one for p95 and another for page load time and i can see the details of each of them by selecting the row and let me open this in the separate window to see the incident details so in this incident the kpi type is real user kpi name is search page where load time greater than 6 second and entity type is ruei application and the incident was created because i have an incident rule configured for doing so what that means is that you can use enterprise manager's standard monitoring framework features to send you email notifications you can also configure to run corrective actions or forward the event to the third party systems so based on this information you can create a ticket in servicenow for example let me go back to the dashboard page by the history menu wine cellar application okay so next i would like to see is the user flow so this is a user flow homepage and the user flow is a relation of several different web pages that consist a specific web transaction so in this example there are five steps the first of all search the product then view the product and add the product to the cart check out and purchase then log out application so five steps total and this is a flow that i would like my customers to complete but as a reality customer may not find products that are interesting to them or they may experience network issues or page load issues so those cases they will not complete the flow and leave the site so this page tells you the overview of the user flow for the specific duration of the time so the graph at the upper side of the screen represents the trend of the user behaviors so the blue line is the average number of visitors and green bars are completed users and red and orange bars are aborted or stopped user flows the graph in this page shows a stable load which means it's having a similar amount of completed flows and also the uncompleted flows during the time so from here nothing unusual you can see just looking at the graph in the middle of the page there is a section which is called the step name and i can see how many of the visitors completed the flow which is 645 and how many of them left without buying anything and if they left the website i can also see which page they left so most users left the flow at the second step so this implies many visitors did not find a product that they wanted to purchase and at the third step add to card step i see 18 of them left the flow so they did add a product to the cart but they did not go to the next step to purchase also 17 of them were having some violations so i want to see what's going on here and the table view at the lower side of the screen shows the details of the each user access the page so in this example if i click the link of the first row it opens an external window with session details so this user started with wine search page then one view page and went to the wine add to cart page but aborted the page load before the page load completed that is understandable in this case because it looks like it took 14 seconds and that was still loading the page so basically the user left the page because the page load was too slow from here you can see the http level details or click out to see the java workload explorer page as we already seen earlier in this session and lastly i would like to show you a standalone version of ruei so ruei has two user interfaces one is the em version that you saw in this demo another is the standalone version which is showing in this screen so this is a dashboard page showing the same information from the em version with slightly different look and feel so what i have here in upper left side is the funnel view of the user flow this intuitively explains what percentage of the users moved to the next step so it started with 100 and 96 percent moved to the view page so it means we lost four percent of the users at this step and that was actually 41 users out of 1051 users which is the total number of visitors during the time and 71 percent moved to the third step and 69 moved to the fourth step and it was the 67 percent of the total users who completed the flow during the time this is the end of the recording of the product demonstration of oracle real user experience insight thank you for watching
