 good afternoon good morning I would like to welcome you to today's webinar on plant-based protein developments in Canada and the Netherlands and opportunities for collaboration my name is Cara Lee Gerrits and I am the director of business development at protein Industries Canada I will be your moderator for today's webinar I would like to take a moment to recognize the partners who have come together to deliver today's webinar the Consulate General of Netherlands in Vancouver Austin L and the Embassy of Canada to the Netherlands have been working together with us over the past few weeks to develop today's program a sincere thank you for the wonderful collaboration on a logistical note I would now like to walk you through the features of gizumon webinar platform as outlined on this slide this black toolbar is at the bottom of your screen and on the top if you are using a tablet or mobile device the first button on the left is the audio settings control this is where you can adjust the volume of the webinar the next button is chat you could use the chat feature for two purposes one is to communicate with us for any technical issues you may encounter and the second is to interact with other attendees if you are having technical issues please first try leaving the webinar closing all other applications and that rejoining if you are still having technical problems please contact Carson Sinclair via the chat function the next tool is the Q&A feature there will be a Q&A session at the end of the presentations please send us your questions throughout the webinar using this Q&A feature within the Q&A function you will see an up voting or a thumbs up symbol it is used similarly to alike on social media if you would see a question posted at the Q&A feature that you would also like answered please click on the thumbs up symbol to boost the question to the top of the list without any further ado I would now like to begin today's webinar it is my great pleasure to introduce the first of two distinguished guests who will deliver opening remarks for today's session ms lisa Halfin is ambassador of Canada to the Kingdom of the Netherlands and permanent representative of Canada to the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons she holds a Bachelor of legal laws from Osgood Law School and joined the Department of External Affairs in 1989 most recently ambassador health and was directly giant director-general of the consular operations Bureau and prior to that ambassador of Canada to Hungary Slovenia Bosnia Herzegovina ambassador Halfin I would like to now pass the microphone over to you thank you very much Cara Lee and hello to everyone on both sides of the Atlantic especially those of you who got up super early on the west coast I'm talking to you Hank it's a real pleasure for me to join the webinar this afternoon I keep telling the team plant proteins are some of my favorite proteins as you know our planets running out of resources it's obvious that we are going to have to consume more plant proteins in order to reduce our global footprint in an order for this transition to succeed we'll have to continue to innovate I can tell you as a consumer that the good news is that the plant proteins are getting tastier all the time and our countries can help with this innovation by working together Canada has expertise expertise in the production and processing of large volumes of pulses and soy the Netherlands on the other hand has expertise in breeding plants product development commercialization and access to international markets there are already some great research collaboration projects going on between experts in our two countries and we appreciate the great support that my team is getting from most ml the economic development agency in the eastern part of the Netherlands and the Dutch representatives in North America they're helping organize the Virtua mission and plant proteins plan for October in addition I'd like to encourage everyone to look at the benefits offered by Sita the economic and trade agreement between Canada and the EU under ceta there our import duties for beans soy beans and peas as well as enhanced labour mobility and access to government procurement my trade commissioner Deirdre Buettner will tell you more about this in his presentation later today I wish you the best and please let my team know if the embassy can assist you in any way we know this collaboration is going to be a success thank you back to you Cara Lee my pleasure to introduce mr. Frank Hart Frank Hart is the board chair for protein industries Canada mr. Hart's career has included roles as vice-chair managing director and chief risk officer a gravestone managed investments incorporated president of EDS Canada CEO and president of crown investments corporation of Saskatchewan vice president of KPMG consulting and deputy ministers Saskatchewan economic development in trade Frank over to you that's just my pleasure to welcome all of you who have joined us today this dialogue of interest between Canada Netherlands has been underway for some time it took a major step forward last November and Vancouver with a meeting that the Netherlands organized and you know I think is ambassador health and indeed Erick know this exploration of common interest between our two countries has been underway for some time now I think it's particularly powerful when two of the world's leading exporters of food and agriculture products can cooperate around addressing global challenges of producing more food while improving the environment and to look at these as of both an vs. and either/or I know there's a lot to be gained for the citizens of Canada and for the Netherlands through this cooperation as well as for other food consumers around the world and and and this focus on increasing collaboration around science and technology our two-way trade and to leverage the strengths of both our nation's in this in this important area of global food supply is a is a great initiative to support the increased competitiveness of our respective economies as we work together so I hope you'll find the discussions today enlightening and positive as we work together to pursue one if I think one of the world's great economic opportunities around plant proteins and now I think over to you Carolee I'm looking forward to hearing from Hank and welcome Hank it's good to see again call T's there so now it's my pleasure to introduce to you mr. Hanks new king consul general of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Vancouver Canada Hanks new king is Consul General he has held various positions in Dutch ministries of which the latest were deputy director for national spatial planning and deputy director for international relations at the Ministry of infrastructure and environment Hank over to you Thank You Cara Lee Thank You ambassador helpful for your greetings to the earlier westcote and thank you Frank for the hosting so today as you are chairman of the protein cluster Canada thank you very much i Consul General of the Netherlands in you know I think good work that not only talking as a consul general but also representing the Ministry of Agriculture in the Netherlands and the Canada network in of the Dutch diplomatic missions in Canada so the construction are in Toronto and the embassy in Ottawa collaboration between Canada and the Netherlands in the fields of the pottery industry the first question is of course why should you go to or work with the Netherlands that when it has only the size of Vancouver Island and when it has only half the population of Canada I think there are three main main reasons for the collaboration first of all although a small country it is the accurate food exporter number two in the world after the United States it has about 5,300 agricultural companies so a large ecosystem of food producing at companies and technology the technology for the utility companies but let's also look at the location of the measurements central-european that a continent 244 million customers live in 600 miles of course Rotterdam and of the airport schiphol the corner to them is the biggest port in Europe Schiphol is the fourth cargo airport in the world and still also in these times when life and physical transports getting difficult I also would like to tell that internet cables right they're coming from North America are going up in the Netherlands so also a guarantee to get your digital a message messages smoothly and very fast to the Netherlands so Gateway to go and second the food producer in the world and last but not least and enough then what is the strength of the sector of the agriculture sector in this country when it has become such a big exporter on such a very small length I think the first characteristic of the Dutch you have agriculture is that it lizard and sector with a very innovative approach to agriculture the Dutch are well known for all kinds of technologies new year living in the Western Canada Fraser Valley the Lower Mainland of the BC to see the greenhouse technology of the Netherlands also coming here to Canada so well known that technological innovative country the second thing that characterizes said that Ecuadorian economy is a treat with an emphasis on air apparently and not so much on researcher resource balloons their own is the production circles and the huge amount of the products that are produced in the Netherlands also to care that we have to be very aware of how do we get our goods to other countries will be exported so its supply chain knowledge of the Netherlands is is an important part of our agricultural sector also and see it for example the gold chain technology that works in our first of all developed for European purposes but it's not working on that the trains to China our flowers are being brought in gold chains rattle China so a huge emphasis also on supply chain what we see of course is also that such a large production of Agriculture mortgage also leads to environmental and conflict but I think we could say that the environmental constraints that are coming up more and more are also a new trigger for innovation in the Netherlands the innovations being that the circularity of Agriculture so how do we take care that not so much food waste the innovation is aimed at climate aspects of Agriculture thing of course this is more sustainable food that's the planning and also Dutch Agra food culture is characterized by coverage the co-operative model between government research institutes and inks industry is an important part of the Dutch approach to economic sectors I think in the year 2016 Dutch government acknowledged that and I quote a shift in production and consumption from animal to vegetable proteins seems inevitable that we want to create a healthier and more sustainable food system I think this short sentence is the basis of a lot of developments a part of course will also from the consumer preferences and market developments coming up next ear the working in sphere the successful cooperation of the three partners government industry and research institutes I before these government leads and gives direction industry makes it happen and scales up the smaller developments that are done in research will find a lot of innovation in spiders so these three things a long-term direction an industry that makes it happen and research institutes belong to the top universities in the world are important any fruit apart from the homegrown agri-food sector which I talked about before we also see that not foreign companies and other countries are looking at the Netherlands to go together in specialized three years and never lets customers and message we saw it last week and I mean sorry it's a mess in the Netherlands between the left side below you see the gap Burgas of the young meals are coming from the Netherlands in the future we're very happy to see that the US company young meat has last week opened the first cone manufacturing facility in the Netherlands with the company called a zombie area and was also acquired a second visit that production facility in the eastern part in melons and so we didn't have the first production facility outside the United States the young meat when this dr this sheet was produced last Sunday we didn't know the developments are going there fast we just saw that this week company up fields announced an investment of about 15 million euros in a new Research Institute in the early days on the grounds of the battling University in the East Park minutes so what we see is that the the existing ecosystem of agricultural companies and the government and Research Institute also leads to a shear interest of foreign countries to cooperate with next we of course also hope that we can expand the beginning quality collaboration with protein in industries the Canada as Frank had to before you're working we're talking a little bit already in the lot in the last year's but thinking here 2018 we made a big step towards a more cooperation we are very happy to cooperate with pigs because it has an open international orientation with an eye for long-standing cooperation based on mutual understanding and I think Canada has a comparable business plan climate and has a lot of interlinked issues with the Netherlands but also complementary expertise so I think here we find all the basis that we need for a long stay in their cooperation where do we see possibilities well first of course first of all first saw dr. industry business-to-business of Incorporation the trade mission we are doing next week Digital a trade mission dear didn't actually physically first of all that bringing companies from the levels and candidates also importance the knowledge technology appropriation between universities we have this wonderful University and well and the for technical universities in eleven except where they think and very well work together in this then of course governments can also have cooperate and happy lights it also the Ambassador one Canada this year at his workshop the presence of both both of us here is that link an expression of the fact that also gladness what to work together in this game with the last but not least was very practical next week at the first and Dutch every fruit mission in the first blush digital agriculture a mission that up to Canada in the internet cooperating in the air to build proteins on it to North America and we lived up north was great work of to pitch to fruit organization have summer blockers to be honored for a long time already and very happy to be the important delegation of Dutch companies protecting Sonny to the North America we will be there and all our networks will have our networks available there it will be a digital break out and will be wounds in booth concentrating long for who in the Netherlands are often very corporation with chemical and also a hard-working work together with what university standout on making introductions let's make her a Twitter account I think we've laid the basis for incorporation of last year's under eye which accompanies most Institute's who knows ourselves lots of success in the near future to make this cooperation work in the spirit of the already longer lasting friendship between data and thank you so much back to you thank you very much Hank it's now my pleasure to introduce to the audience mr. diederich butan our trade commissioner at the Embassy of Canada to the Netherlands mr. Buettner is the Trade Commissioner responsible for agriculture at the Embassy of Canada Netherlands TCS helps Canadian companies expand and succeed internationally the TCS provides export assistance helps understand trade agreements promotes Canada as a dynamic place in which to invest into business and enhances Canada's Science and Technology capacity competitiveness and prosperity dirac over to you brief thank you Carolee that's it's a wonderful event you've got going wonderful to speak to you in in Canada and then the Netherlands ohm and proteins and specifically my organization which just the first our oops trying to move my slides here one second [Music] think once like back please the Trade Commissioner service the the Trade Commissioner service is at baby ports and the federal government's largest international presence we have offices in pretty much all capitals in the world including those in Europe typical size of the Trade Commissioner service teams is I would say seven to nine nine staff and you'll meet you'll me basically locally engaged staff working together with Canada based staff commercial commercial support what I've basically been asked is give you some examples what what typically are our service to Canadian and Dutch companies is so I'll give you some some examples I'm not sure Carson can you move the slide can move to the next slide so the first example first example is a company in Alberta which which is active in the media industry so what our team here in the Embassy of Canada in the Netherlands what we did is we started helping them securing a particular person at the NFI a or the Netherlands for an investment agency somebody specifically for the agri-food sector to help them set up and open a subsidiary we also then help them with very specific questions on tax on corporate tax by introducing them to a specialized tax advisor that could could actually help them with very specific questions regarding Dutch customs and had experience with media industry around the world so very interesting person to what to meet up with then what we did is we introduce them to HIV C which is Holland international distribution council and these are the folks that are running a beautiful Support Agency for logistic services we get the enema see we quite often we know a few logistics firms but it's really a lot better to connect with them either directly or via me to get matched with two or three matching logistic service providers in their case they need cold storage in Rotterdam and when you look at the stats you'll see that the Netherlands has a strong capacity in gold storage so it was for them it was really good to to be based there to do business from that cold storage in the European market we connected them with agri-food promotion events across Europe such as lugar but also the so called taste of Canada events that are held across Europe nowadays and we help them specifically regarding our seat trade agreement with Europe we help them with specific questions on rule of origin which is always you look at the free trade agreements it's one of the key key topics Carson can we move one slight next slide for for a small fruit exporter in Quebec we we knew that they had a pretty strong Dutch partner business partner that did business for them in the European market so in a joint venture they reached out to me at the Embassy because they started having some real issues with the so called end use tariffs which in European Union is sometimes becoming quite a hurdle to do business so we again advised them to talk to one of our Tech's advice that we know of and to actually start negotiating with local tax authorities we followed up thoroughly and in the end the joint venture was able to do a lot more business by reducing the tariffs we in a time that in 217 when Sita the free trade agreement with Europe when it was implemented we started highlighting sida events specifically for agri-food audiences to this joint venture so I think start benefiting from those information gathering sessions and we made sure that the Dutch business partner actually was now doing or promoting the business from Quebec in the Canada pavilions across Europe next slide please what what would be a good tool for some of you in the Canadian and then Dutch audience what would be interesting for you to check out is that tariff finder which was organized sorry set up by my agency together with EDC and BBC two very large organizations in in Canada tariff finder gives you a quick access to import tariffs after and before and after Sita so typically in agri-food products you see a significant drop and we've seen a phenomenal growth in the agri-food exports from the Netherlands in to Canada and likewise from Canada into the Netherlands we're looking currently at some 500 million agri-food exports into the Netherlands and it continues to grow really we're seeing a real positive effect from that FTA next slide please we we also like to to give you some example of some of the things that we learned over the last couple of years I'd like to really tell you as a business audience when you when you look at doing business in Europe in the Netherlands you really have to be persistent you have to be patient don't become one of those North American companies that are in or out of the market that pop up every once in a while now you have to be persistent you need to really commit to that markets take a long term view and make sure that you understand that the European Union is not is one huge market of 500 million consumers you expecting regional perhaps you know just focus on the Benelux at Belgium Netherlands Luxembourg that by itself is already pretty large consumer markets to to focus on the size actually of the the Canadian economy and the Canadian number of citizens next slide please [Music] we we have developed a number of guides for you the one on the left and on the right expanding into the EU and exporting to you are phenomenal guides when it comes to you know the nitty-gritty of exports and doing business in Europe things such as value-added tax labeling of product binding consultants working with business agreements Sita as a comprehensive economic trade agreements you know how do you benefit from the those type of things are in a very nice way in a detailed way presented in those guides in the middle is maybe not so interesting for the audience is a government procurement a guide for people that are let's say architects or engineers so I don't expect many of you to be in that sector next slide please which i think is my team if I'm not mistaken yeah it's it's my team so these are the trade commissioners I've left out the commercial assistants it's a team of seven to eight people with particular sector responsibilities so for signs of technology would talk to talk to travelingval Duke raised and born in Marin raised in Quebec so Nina Qureshi as my manager team manager at both our Canada based then on the right hand side you have the locally based staff with myself working on agri-food for about I think nineteen years now my contact details down below I'd like to hear from you and you have more questions and caramely I think for the next let's move on to the next speaker thank you thank you so much Dirac it's now my pleasure to introduce our next speaker bill gruel is the CEO of protein industries Canada prior to joining pick mr. gruel was assistant deputy minister regulatory innovation for the second Saskatchewan Ministry of Agriculture in addition to his public sector experience bill has worked the biotech startup and a large multinational agriculture company bill over to you please Thank You Cara Lee and I've been thinking a lot about the partnership between the Netherlands and Canada recently and and the first number of speakers have really cemented in my mind why this is such an important discussion I think ambassador health and then and Frank my board chair for setting the stage and talking about one of the world's greatest economic opportunities and Hank you focused on some of the priorities for the Netherlands around plant protein circular and sustainable agriculture and food innovation I think it really speaks to the need for a more strategic relationship and partnership between our between country's so today I'd like to just talk a little bit about protein industries Canada a little bit about the Canadian opportunity what we believe we have to offer to the partnership a little bit about us as an organization and our project pipeline we're focused on developing a plant protein sector in Western Canada through the funding of large-scale science and innovation projects and building the capacity of our member companies to be global powerhouses in the in the in the development and sale plant protein products and so I I will speak to that so I you know it's really interesting to hear the perspective of the Netherlands in terms of being the world's second largest exporter of food and only being the size of Vancouver Island we've got a very different situation in Canada and I think it speaks to the partnership we are a global food powerhouse as well but in a very different way in terms of the export of agri-food products commodities and ingredients we're home to over 6,000 food processors we have a highly regarded food safety system Ambassador Health and talked a little bit about the positive trade relationships that Canada has with with many jurisdictions globally and a very good and strong place to do business in the agri-food sector so for us what do we offer to the partnership and I think this is really where the two nations can come together and create something for the for the future we are sitting on 28 million hectares of arable land we're one of the five jurisdictions globally that is a net exporter of food Canada is the world's largest exporter of pulses the world's number one producer of lentils and peas and the world's largest producer and exporter of canola we are a world leader in plant sciences and agriculture capabilities and I think this speaks to some of the things I've heard today about the focus on ability from a production perspective highly sustainable environmentally conscious agriculture production in Western Canada protein Industries Canada our vision is that we will be a world leader in plant protein and you know the 28 million hectares of land that I discussed results in an average annual production of between 60 and 70 million metric tonnes of crop production a lot of that crop production is high protein pulses and canola we produce on average about 14 million metric tonnes of plant protein that plant protein is highly sustainable and has unique functionality because it's derived from crops that we produce at scale in Western Canada that most most other jurisdictions around the world do not produce from peas and canola and so our mission and we invest to accelerate innovation and the competitiveness of the Canadian plant protein sector and I will speak in practical terms what that means for us we are a member based organization and I think this is a really important slide in terms of I looked at the survey that came in and we've got a lot of people from the Netherlands on the call today and so if you're interested in working with Canada protein industries Canada is a great gateway into the industry we're a member based organization and we're comprised of the entire value chain from seed and commodity producers right through to ingredients and food manufacturers financial and business services commodity groups agriculture technology companies and agriculture manufacturing we can really serve as a one-stop shop for access to a wide swath of industry representation across the entire value chain at protein industries Canada so our investment philosophy we are and we are investing over 300 million dollars into the development of the protean sector over the next four years we have to date committed almost 80 million dollars and I'll speak a little bit to the types of projects that were funding so you can get a sense of the scope and scale of the investments that we're making our investment thesis is really around collaborative research between private sector companies between private sector companies and post-secondary and academic institutions and government research labs but certainly we're welcoming international R&D partners into our collaborations we really see the benefit of international collaboration in terms of bringing new food technologies new food innovation new ingredient manufacturing technology to Canada and so we really do focus on the idea of collaborative R&D and asking Canadian companies to do business a little bit differently and a little bit differently is direct collaboration with other members of the value chain thinking a little bit outside in terms of bringing in new technologies which again is why the conversation with the Netherlands is so critical and important for us well I need to back that up one slide okay so when we talk about the investment of 300 million dollars into the development of the plant protein sector we're doing that in what we call two veins of investment one is technology large-scale science and innovation projects that are funded primarily with for-profit private sector companies our investment thesis is that we're taking what we call a value chain approach to the development of the sector and so we invest in everything from plant breeding technology through to production agriculture through to the development of new processing technologies and creation of new ingredients through to the marketing and sale of those products on a global basis again here where I sit in Western Canada we export 90 percent of our agricultural production if we are successful in the trends from commodity provider to an immediate ingredient supplier which we will be we will still be exporting a large portion of those ingredients they will just be higher value and maybe consumer products but again I think it speaks to the importance of a relationship with with a nation like the Netherlands in terms of bringing in that food food technology and improved processing the other stream of investments we make we call capacity-building so on the technology side we're going to be developing new knowledge new technologies new products and new services we also have to ensure that we have a highly competitive business environment in which to launch those new technologies and and extract the return on investment that we want out of that so we're really working in this area to build capacity in our sector and amongst our members in areas like regulatory modernization in areas like the development of talent and skills better utilization of data and information technology improving intellectual property management improving our brand in a global basis so both both streams of investment are critical and important and one is focused on the development of new knowledge and technologies the other stream really focused on creating a highly competitive business environment oh maybe just touch briefly on a few of the investments that we've announced to date just to give the audience a sense of the scope and scale of the type of investments we're making and as an illustration of what I called our investment thesis around a value chain so I think a couple things I'm not going to dig into each of these projects but I think I will I'll hit on merit and the winning combination and Keturah seeds as an example I think I'd like you to take away a few things from this slide one is the scope of the types of investments for making you know 12 to 20 million dollars we really believe that large-scale science and innovation projects will be transformative for our sector the other thing I would like you to take away is is the approach we're taking to building consortium around the projects so Merritt for example is a processing company they're building a large facility in the prairies that we'll be processing and extracting high quality protein isolates and concentrates out of canola and pulses based on technology that was developed here in Canada so they're building a processing facility we put them in a collaborative R&D project with Keturah seeds on the front end that's a breeding company they're looking at pea breeding and the effect of different quality parameters on the processing efficiency at Merritt and then on the back end of that project is the winning combination they're an ingredient company and they're developing consumer packaged goods for the products that are coming out of the merit reading the merit production facility so I think you get a sense of you know the value chain approach that we're taking we know that tweaks and things that we do on the breeding side will affect the efficiency and the functionality of ingredients that come out of processing that has downstream effects for companies like the winning combination so again very much a value chain approach to these large-scale science and innovation projects here's a few more in terms of court Eva a large scale investment in breeding technology to reduce fiber content and improve protein content and quality in canola the provision analytics LED project is really interesting when you think about this from what might be important to end-use customers in the Netherlands this is a project where we're really building out a chain of custody traceability system so that we can give our end-use customers confidence in the products that they're buying and also to ensure that we're tracking things like the environmental footprint of the products that we're producing so to date we've made 11 investments total project value of a hundred and fifty three million dollars and protein industry canada investment of 79 million i would like to say that we're we're really just getting going just a few more slides and Curly i think i'll make it on time here i just want to touch on the importance of partnership but i think i opened up with this and i hope you can see that there's complementary strengths that we're bringing as a primary producer significant acreage tonnage of plant protein coupled together with what the netherlands brings in terms of food processing capacity marketing and distribution know-how for food products it really lends itself to this idea of a strategic partnership i you know in terms of technical expertise we're bringing plant breeding sustainable growing practices you know for the reliable quality supply of plant ingredients and and the netherlands bringing expertise in processing product development efficient food manufacturing technologies coupled together I think really lends itself to an exciting partnership on a go-forward basis so for us I you know what what's on the horizon we've got the bridge to Food Summit coming up next week we hope that a lot of people on the webinar today can join us and learn a lot more about what Canada has to offer to strengthen the opportunities around partnership and a few events coming up in July and August around matchmaking fall of 2020 Canada Netherlands webinar 2 and in a virtual mission that was of course supposed to be in person but given issues and challenges we're facing today everybody's everybody's pivoting to to a virtual webinar which which we are doing as well so again please join us at the virtual plant-based protein summit if you have the opportunity June 22nd the first day will be the state of the pulse industry in the Canadian ecosystem I'll be speaking there as will our chief technology officer but I think more importantly you'll be hearing directly from successful project proponents from protein industries Canada about what it means to work with us and the the impact and effect we're having by investing in these large scale science and innovation projects so I care Lee I think I will stop it there and I think I just squeaked in under my alot of time thank you very much I like to introduce you to an williamson who is the innovation manager protein shift at food Valley the protein cluster is an international food Valley Business Network assisting companies to profit from plant proteins currently CPC has 54 members representing a mix of innovative startups SMEs and corporates you're doing over to the next week's rich good food serving now I'm doing so protein cluster the protein cluster being let's see if this works yes there is the protein cluster is a [Music] food Valley food Valley being the heart of the - a green food ecosystem located in marketing and protein shift is one of the fee for innovation themes and within the protein cluster we do know for many research what we do is we try to harvest from all the innovation in the plant profit scene new technologies new ingredients new product semi-finished products or if a new human capital which is coming across and we which can help us to to detect all the protein opposed unless we are all facing the protein cluster is is a business network and set business shows you what members are currently a member of the protein cluster and it's rapidly growing are things country your companies are missing on this on this while but anyways it's a nice mix startups scale ups and corporate while trying to contribute to a more sustainable protein production and consumption system in the Netherlands and abroad and I've been asked to share with you some examples of what's happening in the Dutch land routing ecosystem so let me highlight five recent innovations and that let me share with you that I see in strengthening it that Canadian collaboration so what you see here is sugar beet leaf which is produced in substantial amounts by Gaussian which is largest company amongst other activities active in sugar beet production and leaving quite some sugar beliefs which are packed with said to be the most abundant protein in the world and Kosan has set up a factory which resonates and which isolates the bees from the plant eat the sugar beet leaves so it's realization and science sidestream polarization also adding to one of the solutions with respect to where to stolen the protein next to that is an initiative called Dutch and romaine ten hours from the Dutch province of flavor alone joining forces in not only growing fresh dutch edamame but also starting an active cooperation collaboration in terms of communication and branding is that soy and moving towards shorter chains is is a challenge that has many benefits if we are managed to give also some some some more body and some good examples and these growers are just doing that next to their I already mentioned before I think the - land-based ecosystem is evolving rapidly and it's no longer only a matter of startups and scallops and harvesting the potential there but it's also the corporates now really zooming into this fascinating field is just one of the corporates now also moving there are indeed also - combining into region and well the field is said to be the largest plant they call themselves land-based consumer goods factory our company in the world active in 95 countries and the recent field next to there the fourth example these two talented entrepreneurs Coryell and egg are starting a company called creamy ingredients you can read it but they positioned themselves with their technology and products cutting out the middle hand as they say by using microorganisms for examples from the Bengals and robust yeast which can be used an example [Music] [Music] the only thing different parts of the world also creating volume and it's good to see you there but yeah and beyond eternal school active in the same small country as a Netherlands as we are so it's also about creating value so just find examples of what's happening within the Dutch plant protein ecosystem well now moving towards and what's more happening in this ecosystem we see that along the chain various companies and organizations are really joining forces and all with their own specific aims that have a value in that whole chain yes a brief overview of some of the initiatives that are going on happening right now and I highlighted two examples from the we launched a few months ago the protein facility map which maps all the locations in the Netherlands where companies can do tests or a scale of production trials or industrial production in the whole range of all kinds of plant protein products we think that at this moment at least that's how we experience it capacity is the limiting factor because they also the market is rapidly growing as we all know and on the other hand we have our annual summit which will Oscar be asked this year on October 13th also again highlighting some of the recent developments in the plant protein ecosystem so what we furthermore see uh Netherlands is that there is the whole Dutch protein strategy that currently being developed he you ask the Netherlands but also EU countries how are you acting for the desire for Europe to become more plant protein self-sufficient and the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture has stayed in three local themes in which they will focus for the next years of production cultivation of protein rich crops the development of an operative protein sources in the production protein production by means of sidestream valorisation and what have you said that this gives you an overview of the number of acres in the Netherlands currently being used for plant protein crop and it is only a fraction of a fraction of the 28 million acres that bill mentioned before which are so it shows you that I think we have to be honest in that respect that from this this stance that benevolent dispersal standard analysis from the global perspective that is very useful and very we really really need to harvest also the awareness and the motivation also from these growers some of the winter are shown here we came out there we cannot close the protein get ourselves and so that brings me to two opportunities that I would like to highlight for the connection how paradoxically it may sound the EU wishes to become more plant protein self-sufficient and but one of the solutions is of course at least that's what we think is more plant protein is used directly for human consumption and of course then it has to mean industrial and consumer demand and so we call that the plant protein gap which is rapidly growing at the moment we do see a trend that the more the troopers are asking Lauren over for convenience and healthy unsustainable plant protein products it's what the Netherlands but also bra but I do think that Canada can really contribute to helping to bridge that plant protein gap especially in terms of sourcing and delivering ingredients and semi-finished products which are very useful for industry to use and the second opportunity yeah are we in this business we will be presented in more depth so currently I'll give it back to you thank you so much thank you very much your turn I would just like to ask our participants if they could please use the Q&A functionality to ask questions to the panelists and we've seen a number of really fascinating questions come in through the chat but just it's quite difficult for us to manage the process of weeding out which are questions for the panelists and which might be questions for the audience were at large so if you do have questions for the panelists I would like to ask that you please submit those via the Q&A button that's on the bottom of your screen so I'd like to thank all of our speakers today for the insightful presentations I see their audience agrees that today's content has been very is there already a number of questions lined up as our panelists get started on answering these please do send in more questions via the Q&A chat functionality so you'd only touched on this already quite well in his presentation but I'd like to open up the question to all the presenters to say you know if you had to choose one what would you say is the area and plant protein offering the greatest potential for partnership between Canadian and Dutch companies there it is listen for me curry it's for whoever would like to take it if you'd like to expand on it your room that would be very welcome and then we can open up the floor to other panelists to expand on it as well Carolee if I may [Music] being a trade creation or an angry food here in the Netherlands for four count on what I see is that compared to other North American and sorry American Chinese companies I think what Canadian companies can still can still do is use the Netherlands are used at the Benelux as a bridgehead to break into the European markets with all its it's wonderful business opportunities and plant proteins where we're seeing a significant growth inkling he's using the Netherlands as a bridgehead but a lot more as possible I really would like to encourage companies to contact us or Hanks Lukens to to figure out you know how to set things in motion but it's it's it's compared to the United States and China it's it's very clear to me that Canada can really increase its activities that are based in the Netherlands guarantee may expand a little bit on that I think thank you a digit for the goal just before the go I think at the moment we see in Canada more and more that's a key urge coming up to look at the diversification of exporting and strategic partners in any economic sense of course the largest consumer market at the moment I found in Asia especially when you look at the Western perspective known that if you kept your visa is a it's a part of the world where Canada could find some more cooperation possibilities that we only look at the geopolitical situation at the moment they think everybody would understand that a little bit second thing is what I always hear from the companies at an especially smaller companies here in Canada is that the access to market that companies have and also to acknowledge you to do it market which is in a very important complement to thing I think for smaller that's smaller Canadian companies who want to scale up see for example lot of tech tech company to I have been most interested clear ideas and operating in field of marketing and actually mark it be a great community third the thing that looks more from a political perspective is collaboration in the field of the food waste and sustainability I think the agriculture in both our countries approaching the Netherlands leaving a little bit more at the moment and in Canada is with some agriculture has supposed to be more of more with environmental constraints the water situation when you look at the emissions a situation I think that Canada and the Netherlands will also be comparable political systems and comparable or which is in the food world economic development combined with environmental sustainability to be great partners in that field in the Netherlands we call it circular agriculture and you can not a good be called climate neutral or something like that there's great prospects also there for the market situation if you do no tearoom I suppose then apples of collaboration between Dutch and Canadian companies that might already be in place and then as a related question how partnerships work in Canadian and Dutch companies may be able to take advantage of big programming beauty oh well I was answering the second part of the question ahead of you ank maybe I'm pre-empting but you know a lot of opportunity for partnering on pick projects and so certainly you know the investment that we make from Protein industries Canada is investment with for-profit private sector companies with a Canadian footprint you know part of the part of the objectives that we're trying to achieve and accomplish with our investment is to increase science and innovation investment in Canada but that doesn't mean that international companies cannot participate in terms of being a member of a consortium doing some work bringing technologies so there's lots of opportunity if there are companies out there that are interested in projects please send us a note we can connect you with Canadian based companies that are looking at developing projects that might need access to technologies might need access to talent and skills might need access to end use markets so there's lots of opportunity we can we can we can certainly figure out creative ways to make that happen and Carolee I just on the question on examples of partnerships you know good one day last rate I think is the Botanica one that that bill mentioned is part of you know one of the numbers of projects that we funded it's you know the the company has developed an interesting technology for taking out the olia zones with the oil bodies in you know in oil seed crops and a lot of that science comes from bog and egg and you know there's an expert there who is you know a world-class expert in olya Soames with see the oil bodies inside of oil seed plants there's oil seeds and in you know that that partnership I think has been a really good illustration of you know groundbreaking new technologies where you're a Canadian company and a Dutch based research institute that's collaborating to put you know new technology together that's really going to be transformative so will it allow for example is instead of a conventional canola crush oil that we see you get a no liaison body which can replace palm oil or coconut oil which is the fat ingredient used in in in in flat based meats and it it has a better health profile it has a low carbon index in terms of its production so it's a it's a really good illustration of the collaboration that can move you know really good food processing technology along and create better products so you know as a result of the initiative between the two countries so that's one good example I would say purpose I can add one or two more examples first of all also the other way around exists University of Alberta cooperating since a few months I think with the Dutch company to our which sparked a new tako conglomerate so combination companies certain expertise and knowledge in a certain area and the University of Alberta in Edmonton and where the trout have found each other and looking for longer-term cooperation company I would like to mention also it's a violation it's a company that has got partly funded by a big big support it is a Dutch Canadian example by its CEO Michael week he drank one of these Dutch guys that lives in Canada and is now this guy if that gets it can ad pronounce their pet name but born and the art at least read it in in a melon special to say but also when you're asking about what can we do for these kinds of corporations we are now looking together with Mike we'll see if communicant the combination with battling University could even further and which is this production process and it's knowledge ease so I think that there's not possible and there are existing scholars okay great thank you very much so that I've got a few questions in now about pic programming more specifically so one of the questions is does pic invest in research projects alone academic research projects or is the presence of SMEs or startups mandatory perhaps bill I'll turn that one over to you yeah thanks Cody so the investments that protein industry Canada makes are directly with for-profit private sector companies and that's that's our goal in in the development of new technologies in the commercialization of those technologies so we require at least two for-profit private sector companies one of which must be an SME now that doesn't exclude academic institutions certainly so much of the work that we're doing is is being conducted at at post-secondary institutions and government labs in Canada but the projects in and of themselves are developed with with a collaborative R&D of private sector companies great as a follow on or a related question of course there's a question about how a food to guests I mean providing IT services might get involved in in projects and if there's a specific project targeting digital transition within food processing yeah so that that's a very very specific question but we do have a lot of work going on on digitization of work across the value chain so some of the projects that we fund that I mentioned one which was related to led by led by provision analytics looking at the development of chain custody work across the value chain you know that will extend eventually into processing facilities to make sure that we can track food products from farm to fork and so opportunity there we don't have a project on the books right now that has that but we have a number of projects that were working with processing organizations here in Western Canada that might be interested in a conversation with companies that have technology in those areas so certainly would be happy and willing to open the doors and have the conversation I think you know the way the supercluster program is designed in in Canada as a result of the contribution agreement is that there is an intent to you know to open you know these innovations to companies that want to be part of it if they can negotiate an arrangement with an existing consortium so you know we try to provide some base level of information in terms of where the research focus is and then of companies feel they have some interest in or an ability to add to that then they can negotiate with that consortio to see if there's a contribution they can make so you know we're trying to build the strength of multiple innovation systems of companies together to strengthen the whole ecosystem great thank you Absalon edition Kelly I think one of the very practical cooperation agreements we've made with the pig is that in the context of the bridge the fruit conference next week we are also looking at let's say very practical ways of matchmaking so if this question is is done by a Dutch company we are looking for Canadian artists in dispute and please let us know we could together with you apparently they look at a partner for them as we said before and yeah the other way around when a Dutch company is looking for this kind of expertise in Canada we would also be able to each other to this company so it's it's also there's also very practical possibly next week okay wonderful there's also a question about coal products so I was going to broaden this one out a bit and open it up to the panel to perhaps get your perspectives on what kinds of collaboration you think might make sense or might be possible in the coal product space as well to increase the value stream of the entire plant crop that's used for the protein production is this an area we have a couple of project yeah we have a couple of projects on the gold Carolee that that look at the utilization of co-products one actually ain't mentioned with Lucent Biosciences out of vancouver looking at utilization of pea and lentil hulls as a byproduct for a carrier from my kitchen fertilizer I think one of the biggest challenges that we've got on a go-forward basis for the development of our sector here is start utilization so we're looking at a number of projects and working with a number of organizations that are extracting protein out of peas and looking at the utilization of starch so anyone who is interested in that type of work would certainly be interested in a conversation about a protein Industry Canada project and a go-forward basis we know so we are called protein industries Canada but we've always been around total crop utilization because it's really critical that we get that piece of it right to make the economics of this of this work and so certainly a focus of our Indiana go forward basis for us great thank you and just quickly before we close I'd like to ask your room that if he could maybe comment on his perspectives for the global plant protein sector we look 15 years out what does that look like and Europe in general or in terms of reaching that protein gap everything what's happening right now in this new open 19 reality it is all about restoration that's how I see it we are currently restoring our performing some wrestlers restoration activities to our whole food system and we need to redefine how we are not just producing but especially it also consuming our food I hope that within the next 15 years we do not only realize that we this restoration is the urgency for restoration it needs to happen right now but it's also turning into behavioral changes and and I'm sure that with all the innovations the collaboration as I think to front-running countries in the plan proposal I think we can we can really help to make consumers worldwide really revalue the power of plant proteins and so I do think that this restoration is not being accelerated by everything that's I do see that it will turn out to also into behavioral changes on the consumer side within 15 years really looking forward to seeing that we actually we already see the numbers in the Netherlands but also horror in terms of retail sales that there is restoration it wasn't from a consumer pattern in which plant proteins are becoming more important and no protein someone less so then also the balance there is restoring so so in turn there I think the the basic fundamentals they're aware let's go great with any of our other panelists like to expand on that or provide their perspectives on what they see in their crystal go-go's a bill you might want to talk about our 2035 the vision in terms of what we see for plant proteins and in you know the kind of industry that we're looking to build yeah yeah thanks Frank it's um so at the protein industries Canada we're thinking about this question in terms of what the market is going to be in 2035 and we look at the trends around the fundamentals around population growth changes in socioeconomic status people thinking about the food choices that they're making in the environmental impacts that that has the health impacts of the food that they're making the growth that we see in the agriculture market the companion animal market and and the livestock market and the feed market as well you know we're doing some background work right now but we know that the growth in the plant protein sector is going to be significant in the next 15 years and and we don't we don't assume that those fundamentals that are underpinning that growth are going to change population growth is going to continue disposable income of a large swath of the globe is going to tend to increase people will be consuming more protein we know that we need to shift our diets away from animal agriculture to sustain global food demand and so so we see quite significant growth over the next over the next 15 years you know for plant protein pea protein for instance we know that that market our best estimate based on some market research we've done is probably a two to two-and-a-half billion dollar market just just pea protein alone that doesn't consider other sources of plant protein or the co products either so we think it's a huge market opportunity and that Canada is certainly well positioned to meet that global demand okay great well I see that we've reached the time limit and so I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for taking the time to join us today and to learn more about opportunities for collaboration and chronic protein between Canada and the Netherlands please do fill out the survey that will pop up on your screen when the webinar closes you really appreciate your feedback the survey will offer an opportunity for you to sign up to receive more information about future matchmaking and collaboration activities a big thank you again to our partners and presenters austin l protein shift at food valley the Consulate General of the Netherlands in Vancouver agriculture and agri-food Canada and the Embassy of Canada Netherlands wishing everybody a wonderful rest of their day and thank you again
