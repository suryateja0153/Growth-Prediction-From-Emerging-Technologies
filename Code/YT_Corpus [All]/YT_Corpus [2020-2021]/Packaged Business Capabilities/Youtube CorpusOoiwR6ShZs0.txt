 good evening everyone and it is uh the first presentation of december and it's going to be a very short month it already feels like oh my gosh got to get the harry and david going right so this is an action-packed briefing i think you'll love it you will absolutely love it so let's get right into it so of course water's a new gold and remember that this is the industry that is not going anywhere down because water demand is only increasing water is only getting worse this is an industry that benefits from people being irresponsible right and so there's a lot of that going on a lot of uh need for clean water so it's a great space to be in and we are loving what we're doing with it it is december 3rd briefing number 89. so as usual we have our safe harbor statement which says that we are not gods we do our very very best but all our statements of course depend on the outcome steven schnitzer wrote in and he had just a great definition for the company and we're pioneers in the private wastewater treatment business which is a great statement and uh from sanitizing a family pool to designing and building wastewater treatment plants for businesses as well as real estate developers and or existing developments communities and municipalities and we specialize in fast efficient and economical solutions to your water treatment needs as well as providing the financing to get your project done on time or ahead of schedule and under budget so that's really neat thank you stephen that's excellent so without further ado i'm going to get into the next sneak peek from our documentary series that's being shot by the man with too many cameras stephen eckleberry my brother the story behind this one is that back in june a long story but we ended up in a relationship with a group called philanthro investors and this has been amazing for us in this clip artie maron the ceo of fill in through investors and an old friend of mine actually tells the story of how it came about from their point of view and i think it's really unique so let's uh let's check it out hey with all the resources we have we can put a guy on the moon but our water is horrible the state of the cleanliness and the scarcity is scary after all we can't live without it that's part of what we're embarking upon and that's what origin clear is doing in terms of both saving and sanitizing water and on a much bigger scale arjun clear has great bones we looked into their plans we looked into their current activity their current fundamentals in the sense that they have not only earning capacity but they are earning and that earning is growing while there was a lot of hope and a lot of intention there was also a lot of activity backing it up we have that marriage of motivation and mechanics we were looking for who are the other players it can't be just all rigs and it wasn't they have some fabulous people and these people are believers and you know if you're an entrepreneur if you're an investor you know that there better be a whole bunch of believers because there's obstacles there's challenges and only with the what we call fcb only with the faith confidence and belief do you get do you get to write over all of those barriers or challenges i must say something also about origin clear incredibly innovative riggs echolberry the ceo is not only innovative and and very disciplined but ethical you know it's one thing to be innovative and say well we can cut a corner here we can cut a corner there no when you have this marriage of integrity and innovation now you've got something and that's why we've done the licensing wow that is such a cool testimonial and um artie marin is is an amazing guy in short this here's what happened we were we were creating this whole new funding angle to the company and we were figuring out this watt as a career in investor water in the marketplace and all these amazing things and ivan ants who was the brilliant founder of the real estate side of philanthropy investors which is on the inc 100 etc happened to be on one of my briefings we don't know how but there he was and he said oh my gosh this is the water company we're looking for and he says to already marin this is a guy rig zuckerberg and already goes ah i know this guy the rest is history so a lot of great things are coming from this relationship including the really really important fund development that i'll be discussing further with you just in a minute the important thing now is to get into i'm going to get right into the quarterly numbers because that's very very important and then we'll continue on with some other important stuff so let me just review the ma the year so far in the first quarter we were just a little bit up remember that was that was covet right end of march january february march revenue increased by just four percent but we felt lucky because we'd have had a full month of lockdown and then uh we got into okay the first half of 2020 and that all of a sudden there was a boost in q2 that made the entire six months now 22 up and losses continued to narrow it narrow tremendously so that was excellent now by the way why the hell why why the heck do we run losses okay the fact is is that we have gross profits right we have gross profits but we don't have net profits and the reason is that we are working hard to become this huge disruptive player we think we have a i think we have a billion dollar opportunity where that goes we don't know and we know that for example tesla went on for years and years and years in the red in order to become the largest water company in the world so as long as we're making progress and development i think it's a fair thing to run a deficit but the numbers have to improve and we have to conquer the market so let me continue here so the third quarter that was a pullback revenue actually went back down two percent we had a lot of booked orders almost half a million dollars that did not make it into recognition because they were right at the end of september so then how does the entire 2020 look well overall we're up by 14 percent and so you know we're we're solidly back in the million dollars a quarter range which is what we expect last year wasn't quite that much gross profit increased by 20 percent so that's excellent and the loss from operations decreased solidly so so we're doing okay um now what's happening well again we got momentum that's good there's there was a drop in q3 but a solid number of booked pos that didn't make it into recognized revenue now will these pos be recognized in q4 hard to tell q4 is a tough quarter because of holidays and uh of course states keep keep going back into into quarantine but you know we have a lot of action now i want to show you what until now has been only internal uh company numbers and that is modular water dan early's division what kind of action do they have this is an inside look at what we've got here in october marginal water took off with almost half a million dollars which is a beautiful thing and that was really heartwarming we're omitting all the names of these projects obviously what you've got is pump stations wastewater treatment plants tankage a lagoon upgrade mhp means mobile home park so that's that trailer park project that we've been talking about and you can see the percentages here by colors so 100 means it's closed it's done contract everything uh and on down so then we have a membrane bioreactor system for a small whole small town at 80 percent beautiful custom wastewater treatment plant so there's a bunch of stuff here everest skid that's that's a membrane bioreactor system on a skid and 25 000 gallons per day and so these are starting to get down in the numbers in terms of likelihood until we get to the bottom but almost 5 million dollars they won't happen in november but here's what's interesting basis of design remember down early he designs stuff that bakes in modular water systems if you are the basis of design it's very hard for the carpet baggers to come swooping in which they do this is the big bane of our existence is people stealing business but with dan early he's got a tremendous amount that really belongs to him that was october and november right and now we look at december so now in december we have some municipal pump stations a lot almost uh about 1.2 million dollars worth at 80 percent is very nice a bunch of action at the 60 range decentralized wastewater treatment plant all kinds of good stuff uh we have a u.s embassy we do a lot of us embassy work all over the world actually a sampling station another pump station package here at 60 so 30 gallons per minute commercial series pump station etc etc etc so that's another four and a half million dollars now that's nine million dollars but of course a lot of it is in the low percentages but it gives you an idea every one of these deals is a deal that dan early has quoted or is talking to or is actively involved with and he's doing these amazing webinars for that he's a guru for he'll be able to tell you about that so let's have dan in fact give us a status report the myth the legend how you doing good good evening be with you right on right on well um you've created an amazing uh status report and um so really i appreciate that this amazing pipeline you've got it's just so cool and now the world knows what you got going so you you know you can't hide it under your hat anymore right right so without further ado i'm going to let you do a little presentation all right very good all right well thank you riggs uh i really i will tell you and i will share with the audience that i am just overjoyed with the progress that we have made with much of water this year uh um a lot of the things a lot of groundwork and a lot of the effort that we're putting into uh last year it is really starting to bear fruit now really starting to come to fruition uh really super pleased with the progress we made and super excited with where the future leads especially as we trail off in the tail end of q4 here in 2020 and head into 2021 so with that let's move on to the first move on to the next slide real quick and i'll sort of jump into this and give everybody a quick overview uh some of the things that we did get accomplished um successfully this past year uh and things that continue to progress and continue to evolve as we continue to perfect things we really launched a very targeted marketing campaign early this year going after and networking partnering with specifying consulting engineers the the packages that we sell module water systems and progressive water there's a little bit of a nuanced method to promoting and marketing these things so this targeted program and these presentations that we lead with continuing education series programs all of those things are at the core of the success that we're starting to have now so that's one huge thing that has changed this year we're also reaching out to the end users these are the people that need our products whether it's a treatment plan or a pump station or some sort of a solution infrastructure solution or what have you the one thing that i am really really excited about is the avermont system you probably have heard me talk in my other and the other times that i participated in these presentations talking about our heavy plastic manufacturing and sustainability and durability that message and the way everything is starting to come together and starting to coalesce that message is now really resonating with the specifying engineers and the consulting engineers that work with clientele that need our products um the end user looks like if about a third of your pipeline is these pump stations right we do about a third of it we do and then the other part the other products we have are the veritrate and veriskid systems and those things the productization and standardization have really come about really really super excited with where that is going the the success that we're having is about is really related to the proctorization and the standardizations that we've created all of that is a function of the manufacturing model uh that we continue to grow and continue to evolve all of our products the environment the vermont pump station the average good containerized system and the avera treat uh heavy structural plastic tankage based systems all of those things are very programmed very they're very standardized in the way we put them together so all of that lends itself to the ease of adoption at the at the consulting engineered level specified engineering uh level where they are agents acting on behalf of their clientele so those things just tickle to depth of the way those things have come together uh if you'll next slide please if you don't mind all right so the next slide should be showing and i'm waiting for it to catch up i was seeing you ever ever ever mod wastewater lift station yeah the vermont wastewater lift station okay well this one uh this right here just for the audience if you're familiar with wastewater infrastructure pump stations are everywhere we have to get the waste water from point a to point b and typically a pumping system is involved with that there's a lot of corrosion issues that are that are involved with pump stations and wastewater infrastructure solutions the averamod system that we have created that we have perfected that is really a next generation technology i was giving a presentation to a fairly large consulting firm earlier this week one hour training session continuing education session we introduced the average mod system and the feedback that i get from the engineering world is two things first off they're like this is the solution we've been looking for the second thing is they're like this is so easy for us to adopt you've really standardized things it's like ordering a car at the dealership you just check the boxes as to what you want so this is what the veramon system is if you would if you move on to the next slide i think we'll talk about some of the wastewater treatment systems that we've standardized so this this one right here for the audience this is the avera treat uh nbr wastewater treatment system now this what is an mbr excuse me an mbr system stands for a membrane bioreactor this is an advanced wastewater treatment process it is a biological process this is a technology that you typically see used with reuse and reclamation when you're working with decentralized applications like we do it is very common to see customers and clients that have needs for very stringent effluent limits the membrane bioreactor allows us to do that it's a filter of sorts it's also great for reuse and reclamation for toilet reflush and irrigation and those types of things and you really are very strong with the biological treatment aren't you it is i that is my specialty that is that actually truly is my passion that's the one thing i do like about the water space is that when we get to promote these bioreactors these are living machines and it is really it's really cool for me at a personal or professional level to be able to design and deploy these types of technologies and watch them do and perform the task that was intended so this is our avera treat it is a rectangular structural plastic system it is cutting edge and the approach that we're using and delivering these systems that this heavy plastic model really is overcoming durability and sustainability issues that you see with concrete and epoxy coated steel when you're dealing with wastewater those types of materials which were most common tend to be uh tend to have a much less reduced service life the heavy plastics the polyethylene polypropylenes we're looking at uh infrastructure solutions with a 100-year anticipated service life so if you would uh move to the next slide which will i think talks about the evara skid system and this is a sister product it is complementary to the avera treat system and that the average kid system is a our truly our plug and play solution uh the avera skid uses a containerized delivery model this is where we take standardized shipping containers upfit them with the rectangular structural plastic tankage system the simplicity of this one is is basically a pipe connection coming in pipe connection going out in a power connection you can we can deliver a 25 000 gallon per day advanced treatment system to a customer and within eight hours they can commission this system and it is ready for operation this is getting to that delivery model that is so important for the decentralized water and wastewater world you have to deliver technologies that you basically flip the switch without this cumbersome long protracted construction time that's what the average skid system is so this particular product line right here our pipeline of opportunity where we are either basis of design or near-term purchase orders very very strong very strong product um i've got a number of i can see the average treats in december here there's uh the 10k right there and um and i had a uh we had uh some action in november as well and of course there's a bunch of stuff that's of course in 2021 correct correct this the the groundwork the foundation work that we've laid here in 2020 is really setting us up for a very very big 2021. i'm so so excited i know the uh i know rob letos who's my counterpart mark stevens and mike jenkins and tom and those guys that uh down in mckinney we are wondering how we're gonna keep up with progress so all right let's talk a little bit about projects in the field so we talk about all these ideas but what uh what are we seeing in reality so here's a here's some examples of projects that we actually have delivered uh what you see here are either completed or partially completed installations for the evermod pump station this is uh wastewater infrastructure which is so crucial uh to a modern society and urbanized society that we live in 72 inch diameter 16 foot deep for an rv park customer they wanted a turnkey plug-and-play solution and this basically was the preferred solution on the part of the engineer working for that uh that particular client uh the next slide shows a our first twin delivery earlier actually this is real real early on in the vermont system we had an opportunity to deliver when evermod pump stations to an industrial customer in ohio so this gives the audience some sense of what these things look like the one thing i would like for everybody to look at is the heavy plastic manufacturing this is so critical and so key to the fundamental success of the avermod system in the module water system product lines next one i believe is another pump station that we delivered for a customer in new york yep that's this one again much like the previous slide where we delivered twin industrial pump stations this particular project was a municipal customer a small rural utility in new york and um they needed brand new stations for to service an unsewered district we delivered the twin void delivered to amerimod systems very pleased with the way this one turned out these are total solutions uh the intent for this delivery is that once these stations are installed and commissioned the utility owner and their the customers that derive service from these should experience a system that has a 100 year service life times longer than what we typically see out of concrete and steel uh move on to some of our waste water treatment systems that we have underway yeah so this next slide talks about a closed loop zero liquid discharge customer that we commissioned late last year and we are now uh well into the second year of operations for that one very pleased with it next slide is the average skid system that one is our containerized system so you'll recognize the container shape and some of the architectural detailing that goes with that both of these are perfect examples of the avera skid system in the avera treat system and the way we deploy our decentralized package wastewater treatment systems so if you want to move on rigs to the next slide and i think we'll talk a little bit about some of the some of the other things we're doing so riggs mentioned that we are working with a number of uh department of state applications uh overseas and though the slide that was previously on the screen shows a couple of the projects that we're currently in the process of fabricating and delivering for institutional applications there you go that's um showing the uh a 12 500 gallon per day tertiary system on the left and a 30 000 gallon per day tertiary system on the right those are for reuse and reclamation fundamental to the decentralized program that is the average system and the mission that we have underway with modular water systems so i'll go ahead and wrap up this uh real quick with uh what we've done relative to installations sales to date uh if you'll bring that slide up for me i'm talking about some of the things we've done so looking at the average mod sales of sales to date we did over a half a million dollars in booked orders that are that have have either been delivered or currently in production heading to the field our pipeline of high probability near term where i'm involved with these projects and rob letos and i are working with the end users consulting engineers our high probability near-term basis of design pipeline is about three million on that uh the vermont product line so very very excited about that so if you look at the avera treat our sales to date were just a shade under 900 000 so we're making really really excellent progress this the the 2020 has been a a watershed year for us as we have turned the corner and really are starting getting adoption in the marketplace and then if you look at the verity the veriskid pipeline you can see that uh just high probability near-term opportunities easily we're looking at about six million dollars worth of potential sales that i would say in the next six to six months or so that does not include a lot of the other work that's being laid new reps that are coming on board new projects and new opportunities that are coming in the pipeline at various stages of development and if you would i believe that pretty much wraps up i don't know if i got one more slide or not but i think that pretty much wraps up everything on this end that is it and then i'm i'm stunned by the things you've got going here what i really get from all this is that from all this missionary work this you know the evangelism you're doing with these webinars and and really uh getting your design philosophy out there is that you know these are conquest sales we own these customers because they don't just buy into oh it's just another widget no it's a modular water systems branded design and they buy into the philosophy and i think that's that's huge it is it rate ridge you're totally totally spot on with that it is a conquest uh that we it's a conquest that we that i love and we will be uh tackling and conquering many many customers and mountains as we continue to progress down the road 2021 is an exciting year ahead from modular water and forge and clear i love it well you know it's been about two years and uh you know great great things take a while but man you got momentum i appreciate it my friend yeah thank you very very welcome okay so go ahead and turn off your video and i'm gonna continue with the status report and now i'm going to i'm going to cover something very very important for our future which is the ability to finance things remember that the company really changed when we realized we needed to deal with the funding so you go from being a sales company to a white knight like i bestow this solution upon you and that's all about the funding well it is cut it is we we've done all these you know developments of the you know the whole pool preserver waters of career waterprinter all that stuff's very very important but how do you scale it up well it takes the money and that's where we've started to work on a fund now what is this fund about obviously is to fund the water as a career rental programs people like ryan kustra need machines to be rented to them they don't qualify otherwise we can rent it out to them the new one is this waters of service pay for performance programs and remember how i was telling you guys about cambrian innovation which is a big success in the space and i'll just show you what that website looks like these guys are are just on fire and they have something that they call the wepa the water energy purchase agreement they put energy uh they also they're not content to just clean water they also do energy which is interesting that's beyond our scope at this time but it's always that possibility remember that we came out of algae for energy and so we loved that space and our partner in france built a system exactly like this in the uae united arab emirates that still runs to this day amazing you know but not to get into the energy thing what's important about this is that cambrian charges on a per gallon basis and that's called pay for performance and they to back that up they've continued to raise money 18 million dollars right here this year alone so um or end of last year so this is they're continuing to to run very very good funny so it's about the money but if you have the money then you can do these pay for performance deals we are targeting 10 million dollars we potentially could do more but we could do less and it was i mean we could do as little as a million and do fine but we're not accepting investments of less than a million dollars these are special vehicles that we're doing this is not an ordinary private placement you've got to be able to come up with at least a million dollars but what's important is is that once we get this kind of fund going with the either the money or the equipment we've got the ability eventually to uplift to a nasdaq again i'm not saying we will but i'm saying this gives us the capability okay so what's the what's the status of this fund where are we at so we are in good faith discussions we have four prospective investors two of them are for a million dollars each and one of those million dollars is actually a strategic partner that i will be discussing once things get more serious one is for 12 million that's ongoing and once for six none have committed there are no guarantees but we estimate it to be a valid program in other words these people are serious they have the ability to pay for it we're now you know putting together the agreements uh the letters of intentions the letter of intent and so forth but this is to let you know that we have the action okay so now i'm going to play something very cool that ken behringer put together that is really worth watching because he's he's a hell of a talent and before i do that however i would like to see i've got some chats here what's going on and we have craig here love to get involved let me know and he's got a phone number and we'll be happy to follow up on that okay good now let's continue so let's uh let's take a look at what uh ken's cool presentation is i really really love it so um okay so if you could recreate the telecom boom from 20 years ago today which company would you buy which one would have been the best the great answer is really didn't matter any one of those companies that were involved at the dawn of that innovation really did phenomenally well and now are part of a two trillion dollar telecom market now of course we know today that everybody who invested early killed it but in the beginning the first two years were very rough for investors right perfect example amt in 2000 you bought you were down big by 2002 and then of course 100 fold rise in the next 15 or so years again crown castle an almost identical situation and oddly enough the turnaround happened almost to the day as it did with amt and rounding out the top three is sba communication yep the chart is almost identical so what can we learn from this so if you're really knew in your gut that cellular telecom was the future you just didn't have the benefit of timing the market how do you avoid selling into the weakness too soon and avoiding the 100 fold increase you would have seen we think the attitude of getting paid to wait for the big thing to happen really solves the problem most of the early pioneer cellular telecom investors if they were getting paid to wait probably would not have sold too soon we think the investment structure getting paid double-digit yields to wait could make all the difference in the world so we think we've found the right balance we're a public company we're offering a corporate bond that pays you 10 annual cash yield to weight now when the stock takes off you can redeem that investment at any time at double your investment amount priced at the time you make the conversion and depending upon the size of your investment you may have an additional 400 percent warrant coverage that you can exercise as the stock trades higher so if the early sba communications investors for instance had our corporate bond it would have made all the difference in the world because you can see between 2000 and 2011 common stock didn't move at all they made no money with our bond you would have actually recouped your entire principal amount and you at that point could simply convert the whole thing into double your investment in comet stock so you enjoy the full leverage as we start to see the stock climb and of course you could also exercise your warrants along the way we finally built the ability for investors to own these micro utilities everywhere recession no problem inflation no problem you want to depreciate it we can do that too but you're not banking on real estate and you're not banking on the oil commodities market now we're going to own these at first we're going to build a fund we'll launch it we'll figure out what we need to know we'll have this great income generator which is great for the investors and then when we're ready we'll launch a worldwide marketplace so the launch of the marketplace was created to solve water company problems that we were experiencing we think everyone will join why long-term service contract income from water companies dramatic increases in margins and the ability to simply build and place systems anywhere they're needed with no selling necessary and the reason it's easier for water companies is there's no more selling you're simply supplying a need everything is turned into a very manageable operational expense they can start with short-term rentals they can finance it later we can handle it all the really exciting part long term is that these assets will be available to simply pay the meter by the gallon or the ton very much the way you pay for electric service now so let's look at the next couple years and where you come in so step one invest in a brand new kind of water company have all of the unlimited potential this presents but get paid the entire time step two launch the fund we've got numerous investors standing by who really want an alternative to commercial real estate next year we'll split the very generous yields with them but we'll keep the asset with the hopes of utilizing that to help us uplift the company to nasdaq so step three a little bit longer term is launch that airbnb for water just connect water companies investors and kind of perform more of a managed services model which becomes just a cash cow that wall street absolutely loves so what we build in the end here is a worldwide micro utility asset class metered billing means that the more water that is treated in the world the more money is made that's the first time that's ever happened we also think that that could make us really attractive to esg funds in the future so this is why we think we can do to water what cell towers did to telecom we can change everything and we'd love for you to join us would you book a call with me and of course i'd have to mention our safe harbor statement which is here and once again the disclosures for this specific offering beautiful that is just a beautiful presentation of course this is just the there's a book ends there's the intro and the outro but i thought that it would be very very cool to show and again i really appreciate the good work that ken is doing here here's your contact information ken is brilliant these are concepts that he's come up with he and devin are really running the show here while i work on things like the fund and uh and much more call can to get brief on this new offering it's really really good everybody wins it's very popular right now just type oc dot gold slash can in your browser and you'll it'll automatically schedule you it's a great way to go and of course i've got a disclaimer which we we saw in the in the video so i don't have to get into it too much but you know this is the offering is not backed by the sec the securities exchange commission has not registered this that's the only disclaimer that really matters here now what's happening next week well we have some very good stuff in store tom marchisello is going to give us a major report on things in the off and the offing that you definitely should should listen in on so it's been a action-packed briefing lots of fun having you guys on board i'm just going to double check to see rick rick garcia says love it short concise informational and inspiration and inspirational well you're a tough audience so thank you rick i appreciate that and we'd love to talk to you as you can see this thing is coming together i'm so excited about how things are going so as we're closing out the year stay tuned join us every week there's big stuff happening and we think we're going to go powering into 2021 with a lot of momentum so thank you all it's been wonderful join us next week have a great weekend you
