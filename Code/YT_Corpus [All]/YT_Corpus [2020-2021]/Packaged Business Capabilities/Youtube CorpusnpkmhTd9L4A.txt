 [Music] black one of the primary goals with your service desk solution is to automate as much as possible but the word automate can carry many different meanings in the context of your service delivery strategy in today's session we're going to show you where to start with some quick wins for automation and how you can further evolve into advanced automations that fit the goals and needs of your organization i'm really excited i have a friend um and somebody who i've worked with several times through their evaluation azuna with me today hey azuna great to have you along liz thanks for having me on as well i'm really excited about our session together today zuna i know that you've actually gone through an implemented solarwinds service desk in two different organizations so i know that you have a lot of thoughts around how teams can best look at automating with the service desk right and just be clear i i did a full evaluation both times that i did it right i didn't want to just assume that because it worked for me one place it'll work for me again in the second place but yes i you know i have adopted the solarwinds platform at a couple of different organizations and frankly have made strong recommendations to other colleagues of mine that are looking for itsm solutions and i know at least of a couple that have adopted the same platform and i'm so excited to hear more of your perspective um on how you've gone through and actually applied those automations following your evaluation and especially since you've been pretty well ingrained with the platform how you've continued to evolve and expand your automation footprint so we've got a lot of ground to cover today but before we dive into automations headfirst i think it's really important to lay the groundwork for how you can optimize your people and your resources in the service desk to me so much of automation and optimization really boils down to the user experience which starts for a lot of people where they work and i've seen that and i'm sure that you can say the same on the portal yeah that's a great place to start um and and it's uh not a traditional place if you will but it makes perfect sense from an automation perspective so typically when i join an organization um you know or i'm advising a client what i see is that they already have some sort of shared mailbox kind of solution in place and so step one is to convert that shared mailbox and now have those tickets now flowing through the itsm portal um platform but the the key to the to really driving the automation is getting people to get comfortable with the fact that they can go to one location to make requests for services of it whether it's a password reset whether that's you know new piece of equipment whatever the issue is that they have um they can go to this one place and so we introduce the it portal to them in order to do that now there's a chicken and egg kind of problem there right so people are used to emailing it's very simple and easy for them to do that so how do you drive them to go to this place to make their requests and one of the first things we do is we actually build out an inventory of solution articles knowledge based articles whatever you want to kind of call them but it's tidbits essentially around how they can use it with an organization you want to know how to reset your printer well there's a tidbit there or how to reset your password and so getting them familiarized with the portal and knowing that they can actually do a bit of self-service and find their answers is that first step and i think with the portal in mind as you mentioned before it might not seem like our initial starting point for automations but again to me it's representative of who you are serving the employee so having a pulse on your employees expectations and cultivating a positive experience i think is really helpful in determining what and how you automate and i think this is a perfect segue to talk about what i consider to be some of our foundational building blocks or pillars to automation and how you can establish some of those so let's talk a little bit more about some of our basic automations that teams can be looking to achieve in the service desk the next step in terms of the evolution of canada portal is automatic routing of tickets there's a couple different ways you can do that with the solarwinds platform um the first one we actually do is set up keyword searches so are there particular systems for example that are kind of unique um and so we can put in a keyword for that um actually one of the very first ones we did which was a carryover from the previous system was we'd actually already trained our employees to put the words urgent critical you know moderate in the title of the text of the ticket or request that they put in and that would route it accordingly so that it would show up in our queue with the appropriate priority um and so we you know that was one of the first ones we implemented but yeah beyond that it was also um routing to specific um you know subject matters or things of that nature the other thing to to put in you know keep in mind is in my situation i actually opened up the portal not just i.t and so we actually have um you know parts of you know different teams that are using the same platform and of course you know that that's not a ticket that you know my team needs to kind of work on and so we also use the idea behind categories and subcategories to route it um you know and and it's an evolving thing that you kind of do we initially had them as subcategories within categories that we watched and it was a little bit harder to kind of differentiate their you know quote-unquote dare tickets versus ours and then we eventually just said you know what you know there should be like a a whole separate category for each one of the individual teams they should they should have their own distinct categories um versus the i.t categories but between the keyword searching and the um and implementing automated category um assignments those were the the first couple of areas we used to automate um the routing of tickets i love hearing that story as well and i think that that's a great area where any team regardless of your experience or organizational size can certainly take advantage of i particularly am a huge fan of the category or as i also call it skill based routing because that again contributes to that employee experience if i put in a ticket that is of a hardware-based nature i know that it's going to get handled by somebody who's well equipped to tackle my reported hardware issue whereas if i am recording something that's specific to my network connection that's going to be handled by the right folks it's also helpful for your technicians because then they don't have to spend time in the queue triaging the various inquiries that are coming around they're able to get their work done efficiently and effectively yeah at a high level and and there are other features that solarwinds has that i'm you know a big fan of you can do the preview button and see kind of the details of the ticket but it's one thing for it to kind of come in pre-packaged um you know and pre-categorized there's one less thing for the technician to do um and and to be able to jump right in and to be able to assist kind of the clients frankly even if you have a smaller firm right small media business like like mine where we kind of work as one team um but certainly if you have a much larger team where you have distinct kind of functions it's helpful but you know you you touched on the point which was the customer experience um in in my organization not every single application is actually managed by it some of those are actually managed by you know individuals that are outside of it but you know i wanted to make sure that i was a seamless experience and i i i personally hated that handoff um and i didn't want us to kind of do it and so i invited those those team members to be part of the same platform so that if you make a request around an i.t system and it's not one of the ones that quote-unquote it manages well the the end user doesn't need to know that at the end of the day it just needs to get routed to the right person who can act on their requests and that's you know that's what we've instituted with the platform by inviting some of those other teams to be part of the the same the same solution we're again constantly looking for ways to alleviate some of those manual or potentially redundant inputs for more streamlined motions so beyond those basics of automation that we were just talking about the pandemic certainly made it clear that there were some areas where we needed to meet our business objectives and day-to-day operations but we were gonna have to change the way in which we handled that as we all quickly pivoted to remote operations so during that transition period azuna what were some of the ways in which your team was handling that with automations i think you and i had talked before that you had to quickly make a pivot in terms of how you guys were delivering assets or even onboarding new users yeah both of those so as it relates to assets right so um you know we've been in this pandemic for a few months at this point um but it was still brand new at the time so if our car correctly was a thursday that we made the call that the office would go fully virtual beginning the following tuesday and you know one request that came you know to me from my leadership was you know well you know can we let people take you know their their assets home um their monitors their docking stations so that they they have a way to kind of work remotely and you know my initial response was yes but right and the butt being it's an asset that belongs to organization i want to make sure that the the organization is kind of protected and we have proper accounting for that so we spun up a service catalog right you know my team and i we thought you know did we do a survey do we send an email out do the people send us emails all right so it was actually fairly quickly right you know i just jumped into the portal and i spun up a new service catalog and then we communicated that as our message hey we understand that some of you are considering you don't have home office setups and you're considering how to you know work you know in the pandemic remotely because at the time we thought it was only going to be a few days or maybe a few weeks but we we had no idea but the real the point was you know whatever you took back we wanted to make sure that we had a proper accounting for it and so the service catalog was fairly easy you know obviously who you are you're the requester what location you're taking assets from and what assets you were kind of taking um and we intentionally did it that way with kind of minimal fuss and minimal approval just because of the size of our organization right we you know again thinking about that customer experience we could have said well come down to it and put in the request and then we'll walk back up to you well you know my team would have been running around all day or you know we did what we did which was you know put into requests and we'll go back and independently validate it afterwards right so we'll make sure that we properly associate the assets with that that service requests and things of that nature um but but that worked very well and i was going to say i think that that's a perfect example for kind of that next step up in what teams can be achieving with automations in their service desk you have these processes that you've had implemented for quite a long time about how you hand out assets be it in person or remote but another example which i know that you were going to speak to as well was with onboarding but i think the service catalog just like you said it's easy you're able to centralize and specify what information you need up front from the requester but then you can automate that process so that way you can begin to seamlessly delegate who's responsible for tackling what in that checklist if you will to make sure the user gets what they need so it doesn't disrupt their day-to-day absolutely so you know when i started um every week and i kid you not every week every week i would get a request that said you know well suzy q is in department abc and they're supposed to have access to this system and they don't um and that was because you know we were using an antiquated you know checklist process was very much paper based um and we actually hadn't captured all the steps that were kind of involved and so you know this is not just a technology solution so i i you know i'll be very clear that uh it starts with an engagement with the business and so we really had to have that conversation i had that conversation with my team to say what do we need to do our job what pieces of information do we need in order for us to satisfy the request and make sure we do it in excellence right you know you know the right way the first time so that people aren't asking us for for things you know the on the day one of their start and so that's that's what we did we went ahead and implemented we figured out what data we needed we need to figure out who needed to be there we actually had a meeting with the business with the different pieces right so our accounting department certainly is part of that because they got to set people up in the time and billing system um our hr recruiting that's traditional right people you know kind of side in terms of what information they had but we had those conversations and then we documented that workflow and then we also gave visibility right i i was very transparent said you will now have transparency so that when you put in a request and tell me that somebody's starting in two weeks we'll include you in that process because there are certain activities that you have to do and there's certain activities that we have to do in order to make sure that person is um effectively onboarded and and i kid you not i mean yes we you know we work through you know some of the kinks but it didn't take more than a month but we've we've literally had a seamless onboarding experience since then people come in they get exactly what they need because we got exactly what we needed in order to make that determination we've gone through and we've worked with the business to really understand this person needs this type of equipment this person needs this access to this kind of system um and and have that you know and now it's all in a repeatable workflow right i i don't have to look at a piece of paper i can always go back in the the same itsm platform to be able to see did we check off all the steps you know in order to onboard this individual definitely and i think that's a great story not only on how to achieve kind of that second level of automation but also for advocacy with those other departments so that was a great overview in terms of where teams could initially dip their toes into the waters of automation but as we think about what's been happening in our environment with the pandemic it's forced many hands to consider how they could alleviate some of their manual inputs or potential redundancies and digitize their processes and operations with a lot of teams i think a great area for them to level up their automations was with the service desk so finding an avenue to automate their processes ranging from the intake of service requests all the way through delivering them so let's buckle down and take a look at some of the additional creative ways that we can take our automations one step further using resources like the api or native integrations to other resources azuna i know that you have done some pretty intricate api scripts to further automate some of the processes that you guys have in place for hardware tell me a little bit about what you've done with the api and your service desk sure the api was actually my background is in software development so the api was actually uh a compelling feature for me in terms of being able to kind of get into the back end and really be able to manipulate the system beyond whatever might be in the in the user interface one area in particular was around you know importing and updating kind of hardware assets um the the user interface allows you to import them but certainly the management of them um you know can be a little bit more complicated or you know kind of involved and so uh uh solarwinds actually puts out uh ruby scripts i think there are a couple of different languages that they support as well um there's a github repository that has that and so i've leveraged that you know not just for hardware right importing new hardware you know whenever we get you know batches like not one-offs um as well as in particular for our user base um i have looked at other solutions um you know active directory type solutions sso type sign-on solutions um and we just didn't feel like it was enough of a of a reason for us to do it um and so so instead what i do is i literally take an export out of active directory i have a ruby script and we just run have that run on an automated fashion you know roughly once a week you know we keep titles in sync we keep locations in sync you know levels things of that nature um for our employee pool um and and that's actually worked very very well um i've made it so that active directory is the system of record for the organization at large um and this just is one of many systems that are inheriting um it's just that because of that api it's a lot easier to actually keep that data up-to-date than you know having to write something else right database scripts or things of that nature absolutely and i think that's a great way to look at some of the other methods that teams could consider when uh bringing and adopting more automation into their service desk platform some of the other cool ones as well have been with native tie-ins so i looked to teams that have also integrated with their communication platforms like slack but then beyond that there's other ways just as you mentioned bringing other teams into the service desk fold leveraging their monitoring solutions like our native integration with orion and being able to automatically populate data around an alert to take action on an incident yeah i completely agree i mean another one that you you didn't mention is the remote viewer so uh solarwinds has a built-in kind of remote viewer session because one of the things that we we run into right now is um a request comes in and the first thing my team will do is you know skype i am them and then do a team viewer session um and so that's obviously outside the platform and just for my purposes and and for documentation i ask you know the team they'll take a screenshot or something and say i message the client but now with an integration like you know remote viewer it's nice because it'll automatically log that that transaction happened right and so i can assume if my team connected to the person's computer they have you know at least attempted to resolve it even if you know or resolved it so that's super awesome to hear thanks so much for your time today azuna i really enjoyed our conversation and i think a lot of people will be able to walk away from their session feeling a bit more empowered to take a look into how they can automate their service desk further yeah thanks liz it's always you know great catching up with you um it's always great kind of talking to you and it's always nice to learn about the new capabilities that kind of solo wins is rolling out absolutely and really loved hearing how you started and continue to push the envelope with automations thanks so much for your time azuna was great catching up as always you
