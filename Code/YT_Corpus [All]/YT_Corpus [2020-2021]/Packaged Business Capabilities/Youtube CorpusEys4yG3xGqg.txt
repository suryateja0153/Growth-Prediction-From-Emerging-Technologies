 all right everyone welcome to build this is the patient to know and learn how to deploy mythical selves were close to the actual marketplace my name is Julio colon and I'm here with Patti butter so the end up for today is number one let's this go a little bit on what spectrum this session we're gonna go we're going to be discussing things about the partners we're gonna be teaching you how to do deployments from the point of view of the marketplace you're going to be having a ways to share some resources that we have for you in order to have your solution into the marketplace and at the end of this session we're going to have a session and then time for questions and answers next it's so um oh you're gonna notice that on your on your on this chat on this session you're gonna have a share box become you can post questions there there will be anonymously or used by you can allow us to allows have your username your name and they would be an opal button so I got one like this use that so we can know which questions are popular and then those popular question then we have answer for them at the end of the session so we have an etiquette and the session will be recorded we have moderators that will be looking at questions on the chat and there's a standing okay fair enough and please adhere to the Microsoft code of conduct the topic for today we're gonna be discussing how to create commercial marketplace offers and how to leverage these marketplace offers for different solutions like a AI DevOps and security and then we're gonna have again more questions and answer this is a community session so we're going to be talking a lot on getting a lot of questions on the marketplace but before we do that let's talk about the commercial marketplace so we have Microsoft we are looking into the one catalog system on the left side of the commercial marketplace we have the publisher and these are the partners you know them every partner will go into the partner center our nearest of microsoft.com and over there they can set up the different solutions that are available and they would be available for the customer we cover different areas we support I guess as pass and services in the left side so our partners and get very unique solutions but then they would be still sold to the left side would be our buyers and these buyers come in different personas so we have the actual marketplace buyers so sorry usually the IT professionals who come to the marketplace to buy solutions or their users and then we have the business users which may be looking for a solution in power bi office and so on we also have on the buyer side and this is great for their for their partner is that we have the field who used at the Kohl Center to have a list of all the solutions in one single quote and we also have resellers that have their own customers and they're looking into buying solution in the marketplace so they can sell them themselves one benefit of having the commercial marketplace under one catalog system is that we have a one built in voice a one bill for the customers so the customer will see all the solutions they said in that one bill so it's very easy for processing and they're having you know this paperwork that usually IT professional get to get one it has many product so this is a short summary what the Cardinal is we're trying to get everything consolidated so it's one single plate for all our partners and customers but we disagree on it Patrick to talk to us about how to get your solution as a partner well I think you're Coolio for the great introduction let's go into in to see how as a partner we can deliver the solutions to marketplace so the first thing that you want to look at is to get access into the partner center so Patterson is where you as a publisher will create those offers so you will get a cacao in partner center in there then you have the opportunity to look at what offers you want to create when you create offers there's multiple offer types and we'll go into more detail into those but just as a high-level just think about when you create an offer there's three main things you're going to do one is to provide what they offer information is so or they offer the service you want to sell description or your marketing materials that you need to to define that offer also you want to look at all the plans and how you want to monetize that solution so all you want to sell that solution so that's very Stewart two very important steps in the last part is basically a technical information like what are the technical assets are they you're gonna need to properly deliver that solution to your customer right and that can be as a VM offer it can be as a more complex solution that gets deploying to the customer solution or even SAS apps so from from the standpoint is like how do you go about creating that that commercial marketplace offer there is really three best thing three things that you need to do number one is understand how you want to deliver that solution to your customer right you you may be moving from an on-premise environment you may have already a SAS offer you may have already products that you have already been sold on different manners so thinking about how you're going to deliver that it's very interesting like as a SAS infrastructure servers in other words a container the next part that is important is like defining how do you want to monetize your solution so this is where you're going to think about how do you want to prepare your customer for the for purchasing that solution it can be like from a monthly based plan to yearly based you could have even per seat or even mirrored based were you using transaction base consumption to define that Billy model okay so those are the kind of the two are is that you wanna that you want to think about the last part is you coming to marketplace and see which offer fits best for you are you trying to deliver now if you look at the offers that we have a marketplace we have multiple of them some of them are very simple like virtual machines is a single machine single VM where you pack all your solution and you deliver to the customer you have things that like a giraffe's that would allow you to deliver more complex solution this is a multi VM environment multi service environment right it allows you to do multiple ear based solutions you want to deploy it allows you to also deliver as part of your solution connected services let's say using Azure storage or you're using AI capabilities that we have available or natural right so it allows you to compose that solution and deliver that solution so those two there's two areas are gonna be solution templates and manage apps the difference between those is on manage apps basically the publisher will have the ability to manage that solution in behalf a customer and then we'll go into more detail on that a little bit later we also have containers which is today is a one single container we have also the ability of utilizing IOT edge modules and lastly we have SAS application and consulting services so as you see on the on the right side we have deployed in customer subscriptions this is a big difference because this implies who is gonna be paying for the resources as your resources utilized but the service that you're delivering so and that column everything that's a yes that means that the solution that you are you're delivering is gonna be in the customer after subscription so they will pay for the infrastructure the other ones that say no is basically you will pay for than infrastructure now we also talk about the different offers and modernization models this is also very important because it depends how do you want to sell your solution you may be able to be inclined to use one offer type versus the other so as you can see the SAS application is the one that has the most granular metered building capabilities including meter which we just added last year so you got per month per year per seat metered Dhawan doesn't allow oil which is bring your own license consulting services today are not transacted we're working on getting that done virtual machines you can monetize those per core per hour and it's billed monthly and then you have the ability of sitting in them up as bring your own license as your apps will allow you to use the VM offering also per core per hour and bill monthly and it also allows that be well managed apps we just added a couple I think was a couple weeks ago the ability for you to do metered based per month billing so that this would allow you to basically have a solution that is basically using counters or transactions that you can bill for transactions and it just to go a little more details on this is more technical talk you can have up to 18 different meters that you can utilize so you can get really really granular else for example egress ingress you know number of transactions per second for all the different components that you may want to build a customer for at the last two components containers and edge modules rby only and then we're working on getting those into into a higher level transaction monetization models so those are kind of the two areas that that that you need to think about initially as you go as you approach the commercial marketplace and how you want to deliver the solution now determine in the offer - so this is good gets a little bit more the nitty gritty of the of the how do we do we make that decision happen right so if you already have your solution deliver as a SAS offer the best thing to do for you is basically go with the sassá sassá offer that we have as part of marketplace right so this is will be deployed on the publisher description as we talked before there is a couple integrations that you need to do basically you need a way for receiving their customers when we regulate the customers - for them to be registered so you know who they are and then the second part is basically validate and authenticate communications with the billing API so you tell us you know that you accept this customer we activate the customer and then you tell us what billing model what plan are you are you are you choosing to to transact this customer with right it has to say it has the most flexible monetization capabilities and then we can go into more detail later if you guys are interested on that now let's move into into the next block box there which is is the solution going to be complex or not so this is this is a give or take depending on how you do things because we have you may have a solution that you have different editions right so you may have a developer edition you may have a basic Edition and then you may have an Enterprise Edition right so normally what we've seen is people we use the VM offer or the container offer to deliver can either developer basic editions right and then the the more advanced editions of the editions that contain or the solutions that contain like all the all the full-fledged features then they're deployed as outer applications so think about complexity if you can pack everything into a virtual machine virtual machine is super simple to do it's basically one VM and then you can deliver and start you know monetizing that service if it's something that is about more complex let's say you have multiple VMs or you're using Azure services that that compose that solution that you're trying to sell then you want to look into more our apps and as part of our apps as we look into into the into the two options that we have the decision to be made here is like hey do I want the user that one of my customers to manage the solution by themselves or do I want to manage that on their behalf or do I want to have a third party managing that solution on their behalf and that's basically it really so the differences between those from a technical perspective is going to be the same technical assets the same artifacts that the difference is on managers if we go there is there is that layer of management that is provided by the by the publisher or the partner the developer and basically you will have full rights on that environment where the customer can only see the resources on that resource group and but you will you will be allowed to manage the entirety of the resources and you provide the specific access that you want to that solution yeah and then we can go into more details if you guys are interested on that now from the capabilities perspective manage apps have as I said we added a metered based billing monthly base meter billing a couple weeks ago solution template offer would allow you to do BYU well and then with the addition of VM billing you can do or corporal billed per month yeah so that's basically gives you a good overview on how to determine the offer now let's look at this is a super busy slide and I apologize for that but this gives you a cut-off of everything that we have from our requirement perspective and and what are the things that you're gonna need to build those offer so first thing to look into into how do I bring that offer life the first thing is you need to create the offer on partner Center right so remember partner Center is the place where you're gonna create all your offers you will enter the marketing assets set up the lead management put all the documentation support information and technical asses you gonna need for that yeah now secondly the second part I want you to take a look at is the SLA shal publish and this is important because we've we had experiences where customers needed to have their solution yesterday like everybody else but they didn't take an account that from where you start bringing that solution into marketplace how long is going to take for that solution to be live into the marketplace for your customers to purchase there is an SLA and as that icily has to do with the certification process we take very good care on on validating the solutions that are brought over by customers to both protect our customers and/or partners in case of things that things happening so that that publication SLA will include validation of the non-technical assets it will even include the validation and certification of the technical assets for each one of the offers and then a certification that make sure that you know we can move forward now the interesting thing here to note also is you as a publisher right you as a developer as you bring the solutions to market because you will have the ability of making sure that you test that offer before it goes live right so it's not like after you click a button it's gone you will have an opportunity there like after we finish your validation process and certification process for you to review that offer and roll back in case that you need to make specific changes yeah so I know a lot of information and I may be talking a little bit too fast that the the last part I wanna I want to show here for each one of the offer types you will have different technical requirements okay so think about it for for a virtual machine so if you look on the top you will need a VHD virtual hard drive for things like a sure apps solutions solution template and managed apps the requirements gonna be the same so arm as a resource manager is basically the way that with a point infrastructure imager is basically a text base language that allows you to sequentially send commands to to the to the azure fabric to deploy the specific components that you need okay now there is also a UI definition file and then with the UI definition file allows you to do is to provide a user interface so when customers are going to deploy your solution they have a way to properly say what do they need and where the where the specific areas that they want for your solution so you know simple things does name last name sorry name password for for administration to a how many how many VMs do I need on this year or do I do any specific configuration that you may have as part of your solution okay so you I definition files you think about it a way for you to capture the the customer requirements so when you deploy that that solution via the arm template all that is passed through into the arm template the template finally and and definitely configures that that solution specifically for that customer ok and for SAS apps it's that integration with Azure ad that we talked about there's a couple more areas in that area you need to implement also the building API we have a community open SAS SDK that would allow you to take care of a lot of the things so if you're interested on that we can move the conversation on that area to the last part of the building where you talk about the building capabilities so I'm gonna I'm gonna skip that part no so we talked about how as publisher a partner a developer bring their solutions into into the marketplace so now let's look at what is a customer experience right so normally the customer you have two different interfaces that they can choose from so you can directly go to the azure management portal and then click on add resource or deploy resource and then that will connect you to the marketplace directly right so you just have to type in the name of the software or the service that you want and that will get done the other way is to go through the through the marketplace interface right so this is this is the example a marketplace interface this this basically shows kind of the workflow that I was talking about so the customer can purchase the offer directly from that as a marketplace interface which is the one I was just showing you here or the management portal directly from from add or create a new resource the important thing to notice here the customer once the customer lands on both of those interfaces the customer and the customer wants to purchase there will be authenticated with Azure ad this is important because we put the customer on a single sign-on session what does it mean from your side it means that you know who that person is gonna be you know their name you're gonna last name email address phone number and extra information that that ad tenant may be sharing for for for them yeah this is very that's that's very important now when we look at the experience of the planning that solution from like a VM or an azure app experience it's it's very it's very interesting so as I was saying before your customer will go into the portal that will select the offer your services that want to purchase and then they in the same as a portal there is the new interface that opens up so if you remember before I was talking about this UI definition file right so the UI definition file basically allows you to create that interface right for VMs for the VM offer the interface is already built for you so you don't have to do that for as your apps because they have a tendency of being more complex you have the ability to customize that the way that you want it you can have multiple we call them blades but basically matching screens and sliders that come from the side and that will allow you to do that then once you finish that configuration then their offer gets deployed so what happens behind the scenes right so behind the scenes what's happening is the they create UI the finishing file right that's on the azure management portal but then those parameter are passed to the commercial marketplace storage and deployment engine so the the entity that actually deploys the the solutions into the customer subscription is actually the commercial marketplace deployment engine right so that's the magic behind the scenes if you're wondering like how how's this work so yeah so we pass the parameters the arm we already have in marketplace storage your solution because you already build it through the through through the partner center experience and then the deployment engine will take all the technical assets like that solution template that VM in anything you know technical assets that you may have for that solution and then deploy that into into a research group inside the customers description okay so that's that's kind of the magic happens behind the scenes for this our software the experience is just a little bit different because the SAS software remember we talked the resources are in the publishers description right so this is where we look at hey now now that the customers register on the and create that that connection between the service that I want to purchase and the address descriptions that I want to use to pay for that service the customer gets redirected to to the offers landing page on the customer side then the customer does are on the on the publisher side the publisher then we'll take register that customer activate that subscription and then on the activation step basically what we're doing is you're communicating with a billing API saying hey building API I got this customer that you send me he wants he's he wants to set up this plan please activate the description and start building them okay and then after that basically you will redirect them to your SAS app where they can do their business yeah so those are kind of the two experiences so after this I think it's a lot of information we throw you guys so let's open up for questions what do you do you wanna do we have any any questions on the only queue they want to talk about this yeah all right we've got a great question here that I wanted to bring up for for the two of you around combinations of deployments you talked about the different offer types and some of the pros and cons to each of those is it possible to do company citizens of deployment so something like a SAS application that also integrates with the power platform or power bi or SAS and managed tap that that type of thing you could do it it's it's it's complicated from the standpoint of on your side as a publisher for the management because you're gonna have to manage two different solution so the the best thing to do is I will start by looking at and can the technical assets so let's say the the technical assets that go into the customer subscription are those can you deploy those automatically using arm right that will save you a lot of time so I will start like that is the first step if you have manual steps then basically you're gonna have a little bit more challenges because if you think of the model that we're showing you before it's it's point-and-click tight appointment so the assumption for anything that is deploy as a as a manage app or is employed as a VM is like there's a there's an implication of fully automated deployment there so it's it's a complex question it will depend really on your solution the answer is it depends on fortunately it depends what you're trying to do and and it will depend on on the complexity of the solution that you're trying to deliver to the customer but it's a great question is for those developers you could have plugins coming dynamics it has those applications actually in in their core in the comments what game is like that but then the way you monetize those organist through the marketplace offering your services so let's say you have a system to scan email both be that could be processed on the SAS side what I manage app size but then they connect using that login to those services and then you can monetize those awesome and Julio can you tell us a little bit about any let's say community developed SDKs to help simplify integration for SAS solutions in particular yeah a question Brian so we months ago and is there now and github shared a link as well but we do have a hub solution application is two different website one is for the landing page that Patrick mentioned where the customer would reach once it subscribe to the SAS application that that you have for them if you need to manage those solutions that those the subscription that the customer bought we have animation page for you to manage that it is it is a community and developed solution is crazy open-source and is opening for you to use he will definitely speed up your deployment we have using it they have been able to get up to speed yeah we have and we have the the slide I just put the slide on the on the just to share it if you can see it there it's it's it really gives you it gives you all the components that you're gonna need to to properly transact customers if you have a SAS app as you said they're completely pluggable components you choose what you need there from from the basic infrastructure perspective we have what there is a client library that would allow you that allows you basically implements an entire API from from the from the marketplace e-commerce engine and it has a web hook for you to get the notifications from the from the engine and then we have two sample solutions that showcases how to do that registration that activation and plan management that I was talking before a very kick on on on the on a previous slide and then we added also a publisher web solution that showcases how to send meters back to the billing service so as as imagine if you're using a meter based billing and then and you there is it showcases how to do that now sometimes it can be a little bit daunting to understand the workflow but this this basically solution allows you to and demonstrates how to take different counters and basically submit those directly into the API and it also has the ability of persisting the transactions between the e-commerce platform and and your SAS application so you can see all the calls you can see the customer the registration plan management et cetera so it's a great example for you to get started and jump in right away okay great and we are running short on time so we'll we'll see if we can get to another question or two and then we'll we'll make sure to share a couple of resources one one specific question here about aks and in managed apps do we have a commitment for supporting Ezra Cooper Nettie's service within graduate management app store that is a hard question yeah so so we do have it on the backlog right now it's it's a it's a feature that is being repeatedly asked for publishers we are hoping that after after we get the backlog triage we're gonna get a timeline of when is this going to land so the answer is we know about it yes it is important for us to have that feature it is already on the backlog and is getting prioritized as we speak great question and just in terms of logistics wanted to share that the questions that are asked here won't be captured although we'll copy and answer as many of them in the the partner community as possible otherwise there are few other commercial marketplace sessions coming up at bil we shared a link to that also in this latest announcement um Patrick as we are about one minute from from the end of the session do you want to share some final resources absolutely so what's next if you're interested on the marketplace and I hope you truly are you can access or BIOS guide here we have a lot of technical resources in in that akka is linked we also have really good documentation on Azure Docs for the open source community SAS is decay that is the link if you're interested on office available on github for everybody and the last thing if you're looking at building solution template based solutions using you know either the manage app or the solution template app make sure you take a look at the at the address the case because they're gonna truly facilitate your your life last but not least we have great Microsoft learn training about marketplace so it's it's about 20 minutes so please take a look at it I think I think you're getting a load from it and if there is not any more questions we really hope that you continue enjoying or the bill 2020 and you have could do having a great time thanks thanks for taking part on these sessions we really appreciate your spending time with us thank you and goodbye thank you
