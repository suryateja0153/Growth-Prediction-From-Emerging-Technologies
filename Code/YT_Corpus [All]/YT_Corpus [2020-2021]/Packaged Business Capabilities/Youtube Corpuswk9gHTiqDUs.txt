 good evening it is once again time for the ceo briefing and it's a pleasure to have you on board i'm going to go ahead right away and share the screen this is going to be a fun one let's rock and roll so again water's a new gold you heard that a few times for me but it's really true that and and there's there's some interesting information in this report that i'm going to give you that underlines that in the markets as well so very interesting briefing number 85 so we're we've broken through a year and a half on this and it's a pleasure to have you on board of course safe harbor statement we these are forward-looking statements and we try our very best to make them accurate but they are not prophecy all right so bakersfield.com so i got a call the other day from bakersfield kern county uh which is the county around bakersfield which is in central california is actually the nation's most oil productive county and there's a whole story around oil filled wastewater and in fact what i'll do is i will share that story with you right now and sure enough here's a story in bakersfield.com that came out and it talks about this is a cal state bakersfield engineer who's working running tests on how well los angeles-based water filtration company origin clears chemical oxygen blah blah blah being reused in local agriculture the gentleman who interviewed me john cox who who has covered us before was like okay so what about oilfield water being reused for agriculture and conceptually as he says it makes sense so then you know cut to my comments on it there's a bunch of people responding and so forth but as i commented down at the bottom here so we're not currently doing work in old fields as we stated you know the problem is financial incentives and the reason is that the price of water is is too low and i'll i'll show you a spreadsheet that points that out but note how i talked about a pr campaign i'll get into that a bit more so what's the problem with oilfield wastewater it's not that it can't be cleaned it's that it is cheap and in fact there's a water futures market that's been built that trades in water but the price of this water on this market is 500 an acre foot well let's take a look at what that adds up to if you do the math which is what i did here even at a thousand dollars per acre foot the price per barrel of water is 13 cents last time i checked oil was around 40 35 40 in a barrel that's a huge difference so it's not a financial good idea i mean no nobody's going to do this just for the 13 cents a barrel why because they're making 40 or 35 dollars a barrel from oil the only reason it would work would be because of a pr campaign because all companies are aware of pr they are driven by that and so that's really the way it's got to go so that's it was an interesting story and a lot of fun to talk to them and then we were also interviewed by another company that's in florida this is a story in business observer florida is water set to become a hot new commodity for investors and this is a cool story because it talks about how we are building the waterprinter concept people who lease the firm's equipment which runs the gamut from pool cleaning devices to machines that can treat water for entire trailer parks and then sell it services and it also talks about how we expect to do this year financially which we as i've been telling you we expect to be up all right so that's that story let's jump back to our presentation and let's move to the next story which is about growth and esg what is esg environmental and social governance well environmental social comma governance so essentially these are companies that have a grasp of how to be good stewards for the environment they are good for society and they have governance that puts that in place esg now as i've said before that currently has about 22 trillion dollars of assets under management and it's growing fast why are we mentioning this because there was a story in cnbc about how utilities which is municipal stuff like electrical and water aren't exciting but one stock is surging thanks to growth this is a a company called american water works its stock is up 25 this year so why is american water works up so much it's because they are pure play they are only about water and there's very few companies in the u.s that are that focused on the water play utilities aren't the most exciting and so while the overall utilities group is flat american water works is up and basically as this guy says here and i'm not going to go on because i don't have the the thing closed off to me but no one has their credentials as far as esg or their performance track record pure play water utility and i'm going to add that origin clear is a pure play water company and of course we are a tiny fraction of american water works after all american waterworks each year spends a billion dollars only on acquisitions of course they make big acquisitions so the 10 acquisitions of 100 million dollar companies and you just acquired a billion dollars worth of companies but they are really very good company we actually were connected to them indirectly when we were doing the water chain play in 2018 i'm sure we'll see them again okay moving on here there's a cool thing going on which i call the democratization of finance it's a story that came out from my friend roger james hamilton a guy who you must follow on facebook and he tells a story about how jack ma and this ant created the largest world's largest ipo 36 billion dollars and the beginning of the end for the banking industry let me share that story with you right here i'll just quickly summarize what he says that it's a very long story basically 34 billion dollars in the world's largest ipo and what is it basically it's the amazon of finance essentially or or even the alibaba of finance even better that's a better way to put it because you know alibaba is uh intermediary and so basically here's here's what's cool about it and they have all kinds of investment platform credit scoring system now this is what's cool this is what our partners at water philanthropy investors do they give credit even if other banks have given a poor credit score this is the growth area which is people who can't get loans because banks are stupid but of course and here has the ai the artificial intelligence to make it happen and it's three one zero process three minutes to apply one second to get a credit decision and zero people involved in the decision these people are going to destroy the banking industry as bill gates says the world needs banking but it does not need banks and roger james hamill says banking is one industry that will be massively disrupted in the coming digital decade and he mentions also other industries ready are education healthcare energy automotive transportation every industry still relying on middlemen and government itself which rave are you riding well definitely water has a lot of middlemen and the middlemen are going away as water treatment is being done by the end user directly so definitely that's a hot area for us and i love what's happening with the the tiny ant as you might call it okay now i promised you last week to talk to you about this um campground purchased for 56 million dollars and that's a lot of money for a campground why is this going on what's happening let's take a look we've got that article let's take a look at what dan early said about it he says there's going to be a massive upswell in new development and expansions of campground and rv parks all right and of course it'll tailor off there'll be a boom and then people get bored and move on to new form of r r not so sure but that's what he says these projects sites will be regulatory governed to ensure people don't die from bad drinking water or contaminate the local environment with wastewater pollution streamline the regulatory process design and build that's us they need to know what they're going to spend so that we can we are very good at these package systems modular deliveries for both potable water and wastewater treatment systems will find major acceptance and adoption by end users so we are not doing custom construction at each site we have these water systems in a box and this is going to be huge so that's all the stories so far and now i'm going to come to very an important next part of my story and it's summarized in this logo which is entrepreneurship and investment with impact will save our planet and this is a message from philanthro investors what the story behind this is that ivan ants with his chairman he's the founder and he's has a chairman artie marin and they both have taken what was originally a really smart real estate idea but then they added the social good side to it and the thing flourished now they've taken it from real estate now and they're growing into other areas like water where they partner with us but also energy in other areas as well i'm going to go ahead and ask ari to turn on his video because we have our first wpi ambassador and he's an investor so what is artie it's a pleasure to have you on the show thank you artie you're not only the chairman of the overall philanthropy operation the organization i as it's called but also you're the ceo of philanthro investors inc what is a philanthropy investors ambassador well you know you mentioned that we've we've grown and we help a lot and i want to define that growth just real quickly by saying that this is our second year in the inc 500 in fact we're in the inc 100 that not only represents a certain amount of growth but it also represents a lot of people being helped we have now directed a lot of that attention into origin clear and and helping with water you certainly have thank you okay and and specifically to answer your question which i think is going to be very interesting certainly for all your investors is that the way you know growth takes momentum and momentum can't depend upon just employees or i mean if you know if origin clear has 300 staff or 3 000 uh it creates its own momentum but we know that this is a closer to a groundswell and therefore we have to depend upon others and who are the others it's a natural flow a philanthropist is a philanthropy investor because they're interested in helping yes they want to make a profit but when you can help them make a profit it's kind of ideal so they become philanthropic investors and as a natural flow they become ambassadors because you want to share what is good news and you want to share what works for you uh and that's what's happening now and that's why we have as an example ricardo garcia but better hear it from him directly i just wanted to kind of give an overview of why we have ambassadors and again the answer is because it's a natural flow from an investor into sharing the good news with others so let me introduce you to ricardo garcia and here he is ricardo welcome aboard this investor supports we've computed 300 000 liters of treated water per month through his investment and so not only are you an ambassador by which i understand that you're you're passing the word you're you're essentially recruiting people to the cause but you're also an investor uh ricardo how did first of all who are you where do you live that's a very good question uh who am i well i happen to be an engineering by trade an engineer by trade and i happen to be in puerto rico at this time fantastic in fact uh you're in a lovely town and um where my sister-in-law goes to meditate once a year great incredible and uh you uh you're with the high-tech company i understand yes i am i am what it's called uh cat herder i basically think he's hurt cats yes pretty much i uh bring very talented people together to deliver high quality business and technology solutions that's fantastic so you're not a huge i mean you're not a uh you know um forgive me am i saying so but you're probably not you know in the half of one percent so you're you don't have a huge amount of money to invest so what what brought you to invest in origin clear oh that's a very good question so first of all there's the cause right i mean you're doing something that is uh good for the environment i have had the uh experience of seeing or visiting places where water is not as abundant as it is where we live in the states in puerto rico so when when you hear about water scarcity i can see that right and if resources are not properly managed and cared for we create scarcity and as a result anything we can do to basically help lower you know the the waste of these resources and better use is something that is going to help us avoid these things that if not properly done it could be you know uh unmanageable it's funny you're talking about you you brought up the high purpose first we like to talk a lot about how people are gonna make make out you know really well and and you know double digits and so forth but the first thing you brought up was really making making a difference that's interesting yes and maybe that's the other reason it's uh to me the making money is the byproduct of doing good in this case right so you don't really have to worry that much about how much you're going to bring in you know what what's the what's going to be the return because you're working on a business that it's sustainable but it's by by nature by design and and supports life i mean water is one of those things that you can go to too long without it right so it's just it seems at times magical the way that things align a business that is pro-life for survival it helps the environment it is sustainable and uh and provides good good dividends i mean good interest good opportunities for growth so rarely you see that planets align themselves in a way that makes a decision easier usually investing takes a lot of courage you basically have to be able to stomach the ups and downs right and rarely do you have the opportunity to have some control over it so i think with origin clear because of the way the investment is structured it eliminates a lot of the fear and anxiety normally associated with investing so it's like what i've learned is that when you come across an opportunity that involves money and you feel at peace when you make the investment that's a great feeling because usually where you put your money you you put also your stress and in this case it just became quite natural so that's amazing what you're basically saying is that um it's very unusual to find that kind of combination that's fantastic i don't know the statistics i don't know how often this shows up in history but i would say it's probably not very frequent yes that's fantastic thank you basically i wanted to get an idea of how you got to know ivan and rd in the whole gang wow that's a very good question um ivan and i met a couple of years ago uh we we we were involved in the personal development uh i guess training or this constant constant path for improvement and we happened to meet and there and ivan was already a very successful investor you know on his own and good at creating businesses in argentina and uh which we just met and then we we connected really well and then we just basically uh set out the intention to do business together at one point we just didn't know what kind of business at what point in time or or about what but it's been we have been crossing paths along this journey and essentially now it was like the right time about the right opportunity about the right cause so you could say there's some serendipity there right uh that that has brought us together i have met artie through ivan already being the chairman of the companies that german ceo of the companies that ivan has founded essentially now has given me access to someone that is very wise and that is all that is a great business mentor so i basically get the opportunity to do business with with a friend someone that i trust that i have met before all this you know investment came together someone that i admire someone that i trust that's given me the opportunity to invest in something that is worthwhile and then having the opportunity to learn from someone who's very wise and who's uh who creates business that do good not just business for the sake of speculation and getting rich business for the sake of making a difference helping others and generating a good return well you know that's so true because for this in june is when we met up with uh with what ivan happened to serendipitously meaning through chance end up in one of my briefings and then went to artie and said this this guy riggs and artie goes uh that guy riggs i've known him for too long and uh one thing led to another so uh in fact ivan tells us that you met on august 12 2012 at 8 37 a.m [Laughter] that's probably right right that's too funny yes this is funny i just say ricardo but but i think your green screen button is still on i don't want people to say does this guy realize that we can see the background through so just to let everybody know that we know that this thing looks it's not because ricardo is actually a a poltergeist it's a zoom effect there we go that was perfect but uh ricardo uh what are your plans for the future now that you're a philanthro-investing ambassador well many uh first of all i have this opportunity to do good while helping others to do good so basically like all the things i'm able to benefit from help the environment uh generate income generate wealth uh grow now this is a vehicle that i can use to extend this opportunity to others and it's something that uh very few people have access to i mean very few people have access to high quality investments you know that provide a a certain degree of safety and not safety because of guarantees or anything like that just because you can see that you know the needs and the trends and then um just basically raise the awareness and give people an opportunity just like you mentioned with the ant story like you're giving people the opportunity to invest into something that they can do really well with but they probably wouldn't have had the opportunity to to learn on their own because what they're exposed to uh not necessarily provides you know this this quality wow yeah in fact keith rooten uh has has high praise for you uh he just uh he's one of our longtime investors and it gave us a great testimonial he says very excited about the positive possibilities and growth of ocln and philanthropy investors rick said it well so thank you ricardo and i invite anyone who wants to drop in a little chat i'll i'll answer questions or give you a shout out meanwhile i'm going to continue showing you a couple more things and don't go because we're not letting you go just yet ricardo so hang in there okay so i'm going back into share mode here and i'm going to quickly cover the many of you guys have seen this before so i'm not going to spend much time on it how can you participate in this future exactly what ricotta has been talking about and then this corporate bond which i'm again i'm not going to spend time on and some of these features are going away by the way there's there's some changes coming and you may want to take advantage of this while you can so those of you have been around for last couple years you've noticed that the terms of our investments have gotten well less and less um over the top shall we say because we've gotten more and more secure and more able to project our investing capabilities and we're now bringing in some amazing investors so i would strongly recommend you give the team a call i'm not going to go through this but we know why you're investing which is basically to help our own investing with a purpose happen the basic way to do it is go ctrl l which will put your control l as a keyboard shortcut to put your cursor in the browser address and then just type in oc dot gold slash can and you'll get a chance to schedule a call or just email us or call can existing investors please take ken's call you think you'll be very excited with the latest news he has for existing investors only okay a bit more here i'm going to tell you that there that i just spoke to you about what we call a regulation d that's the securities exchange commission has this designation and it is an unregistered offering that they have not passed on the merits of so that's that part now next week there's we're actually going to have a clip from the coming documentary and here is a picture of my brother steven in my front yard in clearwater florida as he has he has way too many cameras literally all of those cameras were trained on me for this cool interview and he also has gone up north to visit with dan early a beaut that was that beautiful interview you saw last week he's going to texas on sunday so that on monday he'll be shooting and he's just doing a bunch of coverage and i believe artie he'll be interviewing you too yeah yeah i'm looking forward to it indeed so i have a lot to talk about as you know because of my career with the pool industry absolutely and i think we we should actually play some of that next week we'll take we'll get some excerpts from that and play that that should be because already actually you were a year with teledyne am i right correct training all their uh clients uh in men's and all their clients who build pools or were involved in the pool industry yeah wonderful so our pool preserve is doing amazingly well we'll get a report on that as well so do show up next week and you'll get to see some good stuff so ricardo jump back on i'd like to everyone to be able to say goodbye to you and um again we tremendously appreciate your you're investing in the company by the way uh ivan tells us that the spanish subtitles of the testimonials for water philanthropy investors are in the philanthropy investors youtube channel so water philanthropy investor ambassadors will be able to disseminate in latin america and spain and uh wow that's super cool in fact we should take a look at that while we can because um youtube philanthropy investors has this here we go i'm going to go ahead and pull that up and um and just see what that's about because water philanthropists the this is the the one with that is um set up to play they environmentally without the um spanish subtitles and then there's a version that has them with so if you just go to fill in through investors you will get a chance to see they our various investors talking about how they are felt what are philanthropy investors etc so without further ado i'd like to thank everyone for having come on board ricardo uh thank you again artie you're the man and uh we'll have a good
