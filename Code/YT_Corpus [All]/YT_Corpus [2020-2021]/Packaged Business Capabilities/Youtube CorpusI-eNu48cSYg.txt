 and good afternoon this is recycle bury and we are once again on waters a new gold and I've got Tom March SLO and and then early is lurking in the background and he's he's passing the webcam test right now but Tom show us what's it on on the wall there right next to you to your left that's my Penn State Stadium 110,000 people strong baby white out so my wife got this for me for my birth that I was pretty sick I I'm a big Penn State fan what do you do well I have nostalgia for full stadiums because we're not gonna see those for a while it was kind of weird right I'm like getting used to this weird new life of Corona after life it's like blood indeed so this is this is what covin has done to the clean shaven relatively clean shaven Dan early waiting for it we're going to see how long it will grow because it's it's interesting so ladies and gentlemen we have a trio here top left is Tom arches hello chief operating officer at the bottom depending how your screens are laid out is Dan early our chief engineer captain she can handle it that anything crystals they cannot do it anyway I'm gonna but that further ado I'm gonna cut to our our slideshow and and then we'll get into a very interesting call today and as people are still joining us I'm gonna nevertheless I'm gonna start that's how we roll all right why does new gold helping you thrive in the wallet world's only vital scarce and recession-proof market it is Thursday July 9th and things are moving along in this summer I'm speaking to you now from Florida we've we've made our move and I'm still surrounded by box is this why I've got a nice virtual screen behind me because it's kind of chaotic now of course I'm gonna give you guys the guys and gals the disclaimers of course that were not gods although we try very hard and that the SEC Securities Exchange Commission they basically put our reports up and by the way we've come out with both our annual report and the first quarter report and may I add that we have some great news for the quarter which was that numbers were up and so q1 was well over a million dollars compared to q1 2019 which was a little bit under a million dollars so that was good news and that's that's a good job to you and your team Tom thanks guys worked art they did indeed so I really should have a graph up but I don't but what we're gonna go right into is something technical the pond stuff so hamster but you know Tom I'm gonna let you take over so I'm gonna turn off this chair and let you take over and run a little deck this is a shortened version of the big geek water geek deck but this is a new product that is revolutionary hey it's the pond stir the pond monster yes I like it so so yes I actually drew it myself by hand it's true yeah and I drew a purple and pink because it represents the whole concept of recycling water which you'll often see purple pipe or pink pipe out there in the irrigation world you know so it's it's owed to the whole concept of pond water recycling and you know I say that affectionately because there's tons and tons and tons of these ponds everywhere and what you'll notice is no matter where you go if you especially in the south or from Florida or Texas or wherever you'll see these big gigantic open pond lagoons all the time with water sitting on and you're thinking to yourself hey can I swim in that can I drink that you know is that clean or not like it's kind of circulating through your head and what you'll notice in most of the industry is that pond water gets recycled pond water does get cleaned it gets treated whether it's chlorine or aeration all these other things but then there's other wonderful situations where ponds are used as wastewater cisterns ponds are used as holding tanks ponds are used in industrial agriculture or even sewage treatment and you start thinking gone wait there's actually more ponds that contain more than just some rainwater there's other stuff floating around in these ponds and so sometimes you'll get a situation where we encountered where there is these things called mobile home parks in the south which literally just dumped their raw wastewater into a pond that sits out in the back 40 of these mobile home parks and it's pretty nasty actually and it's really not treated and this is a bit of a throwback to the years ago treatment of like having septic tanks and open pond aeration where essentially you're allowed to do this stuff for a while but with new laws and new regulations coming about there's a lot more crack down on that industries you know using the pond as a sewage treatment facility and now you really do have to put it on site treatment capability on that so working with Dan and the team you know we came up with you know concepts around stuff we already did which is a mobile containerized treatment idea for this because we thought well rather than having this this dirty little mess out there with the smelly Brown pond you know you can clean it up and meet regulatory requirements and do a better job so thus comes the pond stir which is an MBR a membrane bioreactor and uses some really ingenious you know organic and bio capable organisms to eat the effluent and that's what it does it just eats effluent all day long mmm delicious and basically turns that brown water into much less brown water hopefully clear clean less stinky water and Dan the team did some beautiful CAD update drawings with our little pond stirrer and a cool enclosure containerize ready to just you know drive in and drop off and plug in the connections and yeah you toss the hose in the lake and let it go so that's essentially how this thing works and it it it's kind of built for the concept about an acre wide pond generally speaking and they should work pretty good and Dan would be much more astute to describe the mechanics of how a bioreactor works and MBR so I'll leave that part to him but you get the general gist of how how it's set up to work I'll finish my share with just how does an MBR work because we talked about it and as we said it's a biological treatment methodology and it really allows for clarification one process so when you take that stinky brown water and you run it through the MBR methodologies it captures all the dirty little molecules in there and grabs them and then separates the nice clean water from the dirty stuff and allows you to basically biologically do that clarification and returns a nice clean water back to the pond so that it basically freshens at the pond also produces let's the pond be a lot healthier a lot more oxygen in and a lot more able to use the natural processes that allow nature to you know clean those things up it is a it's a really cool thing and you know it's something we can do at scale or in small batches and it's very cost efficient and you know I think that just gets into we do it because we're awesome I really do think it's a it's kind of a game changer for us I'm excited about this one we're doing for the mobile home park environment and then obviously the the pond stirrer has other applications and other verticals because we'll be able to do a very similar concept you know for this whole role in rollout deployment model and that's that's about we're at so I will say thanks and you can go back to Dan okay geek ville is for the geeks in the audience for all you engineers out there that rock the world this is for you so um so Tom did a good job don't come to an excellent job of describing the membrane bioreactor which is it is one of our leading technologies that we use for wastewater treatment it does accomplish liquid solid clarification in a single step process it is a biological process a lot of things we do on the modular water equipment side is its wastewater treatment related products and live machines the key turn is a living machine biological treatment is extremely efficient when we're able to leverage the biological aspects of national occurring bacterial capabilities that exist in the environment it gives us the ability to build machines that can do really phenomenal things so Tom described our membrane bioreactor which is a living machine that uses the ultra filtration liquid solid step separation technology that allows us to reuse water for a whole lot of different things what we have on the screen in front of you tonight is a variant of the pond stirrer this one is designed for lagoon systems wasteman systems where you want to augment or provide some form of a supplemental treatment process where you might not be able to ensure to achieve all of your treatment within existing Lagoon system so I'm gonna zoom in so everybody see this thing a little closer so this right here this this system is a new product that we've created we have about three different versions of this this one that you're looking at on the screen is rated at 30,000 gallons per day it's not a big flow but with the modular water systems product lines we're all about decentralization and decentralization typically see smaller treatment systems and smaller applications and that's exactly what we have now that we're showing to you tonight so to give you some sense of what the dimensions are this is this is a structurally reinforced thermoplastic box it's not all that big it's about 16 and a half feet long it is about five feet tall and it's about eight and a half feet wide so it's fairly small it's not a very big system it does have inside of it any really nifty enclosed equipment room this truly is what we consider a plug and play technology so this system where as made of structural plastic it's corrosion resistant is designed to receive water from the pond it's pumped through into the bioreactor chamber and that would be this space that you see in the cutout right here and so this the system right here utilizes a different version of a living machine we are using a we refer to as a stationary fixed film what is really nifty about this variation of the pond stir treatment system is that we're using a an extremely porous ceramic media which Foster's the development of a very robust highly capable biofilm that's just a fancy word for saying it's sticky bacteria natural microorganisms that would live within the porous media and so we will take and pulp our water through this wastewater treatment facility through this the posture unit it's under aeration so we have diffused aeration systems that are underway providing atmospheric oxygen we have nutrients in the form of the waste water pollutants that are in the lagoon and when we put the biofilm technology in the reactor as you see it there on the screen we're just providing a perfect environment for the biology and for the bacteria to provide the wastewater treating the process and what it does it consumes the carbon and oxidizes the carbon by natural activity it will consume and readily address nutrients in the form of nitrogen and phosphorus this is one of the beautiful things about a very robust next order type biofilm process so that is a quick overview of what this system is designed to do very energy-efficient for a 30,000 gallon per day process our peak instant power demand would be about one kilowatt of total power at any one so it's very very energy efficient thank you please about your building so there you go rigs rigs Tom that is uh that's the the nerdy term of the day its pond stir and biofilm so well there's a secret sauce in here which is a mesh of a very special ceramic that is material that you control the source and it's actually trade secret and it makes this whole thing extremely efficient them i right that is correct it's a process that I've been working on with with several strategic partners of ours I've been working on this now for about four or five years and having been in the industry now for about twenty years to a little bit over 25 22 22 years now in the water industry in the wastewater industry this is a technology that has never had its application before is this is the next generation this is a true game changer this is a market disrupter capable technology capability I'm very so basically for about ten lightbulbs you you can just keep cleaning 30,000 gallons a day basically that is correct yeah that's a good analogy 10 10 lightbulbs would be a generally equivalent the power demand that we would use to treat 30,000 gallons per day it's scary good thank you that is truly a breakthrough so we're actually moving into application on this and I wanted to give you all an update because one of these poster units is actually as you know going literally into it's going into the world in a location in Troy Alabama and so I'm gonna go ahead and show you a spreadsheet with the latest rental model i've anonymized it so we don't have to protect the guilty but this is now a mobile home park rental model it's our pilot number two in the investor water marketplace lab and so if i look here at this spreadsheet and i'm gonna go ahead and get rid of the ribbon here there we go so what do we have here this is by the way developmental model do not take this as read but and remember in the first one the pool preserver that was us doing our own little financial magic we did a deal basically and we had no investor we made it happen by ourselves with both cash and stock this is the next step where we're moving towards a true rental model where a machine goes out and then gets rotated but the good part is is that we're starting with a three-year commitment by the first end-user so that we have least have three years of stability so if we and as you can see there's no downtime for years one through three because we have a contract we'll lock from that end-user but then nao goes away they do have an opportunity to buy it out and I'll show you that in a second and once they go away we're going to start putting in a circulation as a fleet machine and if we look over here at the months now all the way down here the last eleven month of your four we lose a we lose a month we're just saying hey there's gonna be a month of downtime out of the twelve in both years four and five when we take a machine back find a new trailer park to put it in and so forth so that means that we're creating a downtime reserve we're taking money off the table so that we allocate for it now here's what the investors looking at the equipment that we just discussed the 30,000 gallon is about $50,000 but that is a raw cost that origen clear is negotiated from a provider and - that is add origin clears management fee which really you know should be 20% but you know what we're we're still playing with that or we want to make sure is that it works if things work out for everybody if this is 20% then we have to fit a little bit with some of the numbers I think we haven't negotiated there we go that that pulls it together okay so what does this look like for the full term rental the investor is seeing and I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna give this investor back that little upfront because we're nice guys so now the investor is paying essentially what we negotiated the price for and we're taking just the 20% of the back end okay but now month by month here goes and at the end of five years investor has made any $1,000 and we've made 20 which is that's the power of a life cycle is continuing money now the fun doesn't stop at five years for us this is the magic that I'm going to show you in a minute internal rate of return what that basically means is is if you take 50 negative 50 and you add 16,000 to it you get you're still making negative 67 percent but if you go ahead and you start stacking these up eventually this turns into eventually this turns into right here this is roughly $50,000 which means we're right there at the break-even in three years four years four and five our gravy so total rate of return basically stacks the gains of each year against the prior year so the fifth year you see stacks them all together that's kind of how it works now here's the real magic over here the investor continues to own the item so therefore the investor can take the first year accelerated depreciation it can depreciate that is take advantage in taxation system of the full cost of that system year one and here it is being paid for and sure enough it results in a much higher yield we had it to annual yield of 21 percent per year here well now it's 32 percent and overall ends up being about 28 percent so that is and the internal rate of return goes from 19% to 36 percent which is very rich indeed so this is the kind of stuff we like moving forward let's say the investor sorry the end user has the right to buy this out at the end of year 3 this this particular end user is that is prepared to commit to 3 years of lease they can purchase at the end of 3 years well we still make money not quite as much but still tax advantage to 28% even after paying back the IRS for part of the cost there so things do work out here and we just turned it over now here's the magic we believe that see the investor now has made all his or her money in five years is happy and now as fully depreciated the unit etc and now Gorge and clear receives that unit for $1 this unit that Dan is designed has a 25 to 30 year life cycle so if we can last through five years of making money good money we can actually end up with having fleets at the end and when we go to peace out or rent out a unit with zero cost basis how profitable is that I had a business in the 80s where I was computerizing all these businesses in New York City and it was really tough it was each each one of them was a whole new thing and it was very discouraging and I wound up giving the business to my best salesman well he became a millionaire off of what the continuing life cycle of all those customers that I created in New York in the 80s because and he literally told me a few years later I still have to cut some of the customers you got me back in the 80s so if you can just stay with customers it develops an amazing return on investment with completely lost expense so that becomes really interesting now as you notice there's no market here right there's no quote-unquote market because what we're doing is origin clear we're doing this for ourselves we're this is a gimme for origin clear we are being the water company and also we're working we're being the quote unquote property manager for the investor and we're also making sure that the Machine works separately there is a service contract way over here that is billed separately the end user and by the way that's way too much I need to adjust that big time there we go thank you that's more like it so there's cash being paid for service it's not a high amount of money because this is very low maintenance type item changing the occasional consumable and so forth this does nothing but sweeten up the returns for our investor and I guarantee you that a five-year IRR that's in the high 20s let alone the 30% range regardless of tax Rick Keller will tell you this is pretty pretty amazing now you can tell I'm still fiddling with things I'm still moving things around we've not presented this we've we've presented a a number to the end user but the investor will be seeing this on Monday and we're putting in the final touches on it so you're seeing this as it is in progress so remember it is a developmental model okay so I'm gonna save this and we are gonna go into the next thing which is you know I was mentioning by the way how we did in the first quarter and here it is we did really well compared to last year last year a q1 was 742 thousand this year it was a million dollars Tom well done to you and your team gross profit was significant and we go all the way down here's the amazing part we actually had a huge net income 21 million dollars well that's that's the magic of of accounting because that was just some black magic that occurred and it really was because of some changes in the conversion of that whatever it these are numbers that that we just call black magic so we like to concentrate more on the upper numbers here because that reflects what we're actually getting done we still have some loss from operations and why is that that is because we're doing things like developing this marketplace and just like anybody else who's doing a zero to one that is there was nothing before and now there's something like Airbnb uber or Tesla versus a one plus write a one plus is there was already something there and I make another one of them and that's all the car companies in the world copied each other so forth euro was expected to make money much earlier but when you're making something new that's when you have to invest okay so so I'm done with that part and I just wanted to also mention that we have a shareholder letter going out very shortly and with an excellent article that appeared in the book or a ton and those of you who are on the shareholder list while we're receiving this as well as an update from me and in fact here it is this update gets into all the cool stuff talking about how 2020 has changed everything things are better than they were in 1918 but still not great why don't is to be stable needs more people needs to do a better job because we need to prevent public health problems and then I talked about what's been happening in house how are we gonna help the water industry expand and that's where I talked about for the first time broadly about this marketplace the three labs that we're doing we're on number two right now and how you could invest in the offering and imagine you're an investor in the company that pioneered this well actually you are you helped us make it happen so give yourself a hand so that's going out to a bit over 8,000 people and it will also be on the website and it'll be in the transcript of this briefing on origin clear calm / CEO well we're at 831 now and I wanted to get into a really really important next topic which is your survival in mind my friend Roger James Hamilton has a show called entrepreneur TV and I strongly recommend that you subscribe to it on YouTube he wants to talk to us about how oh and just real fast before you go on we have a question here whether the posture can be patented and the answer is is that we are relying more on trade secrets for it as we've been disclosing in our annual reports we've begun to believe that patents are a great way for actors like China to game-game the whole show and so we've moved over to trade secrets we have the basic licence patents that we licensed from Dan early but these derivative products were maintaining under trade secret okay so back to generati James Hamilton and when is the dollar crash happening how and why is the dollar crash happening and the five things you can do for protection profit as a result of this crash so first of all he points out that the VIX which is the volatility index is sky-high now this is really important because volatility is a very dangerous indicator the last two weeks have seen volatility go sky-high that tells us that the stock market is not in a great place and if I were you I would take a very I'd be investing things I golde not not whatever right not Procter & Gamble again I don't give stock advice but that's that's what he's pointing to so what does that mean well Steven Roach Asia expert tells us that a dollar crash that virtually inevitable so with the stock market potentially crashing we also have a dollar crash coming along and that is a very dangerous thing as he says the national savings rate is probably going to go deeper the negative territory so we're gonna save less and less because Americans have not been making money and also we've been isolating ourselves away from globalization and that he thinks is a bad thing I personally think that it's a good thing that was starting to manufacture more in the United States there were less dependent but that's a matter of opinion Ray Dalio says cash is trash who is Ray Dalio he's only the most successful hedge fund partner in the world he's got the largest hedge fund he is personally were 16 billion dollars why is he saying cash this trash well we'll talk about that some more so I'm taking you quickly through his YouTube which I will give you a link to in a bit let's talk a little bit about the dollar we have the dollar is basically going right there down at the bottom essentially what was worth $100 is now worth less than a dollar today so we are right there facts ever since 2008 was the last gasp of the dollar value you could argue that it really is started with the post war Bretton Woods Agreement which put in place what's called the new world order today Ray Dalio says this all reserve currencies in the past have ceased to be reserve currencies often coming to traumatic ends for the countries that enjoyed this special privilege so why the dollar will decline but how will it change the world etc and then he gets into these very interesting things about great empires I'm not gonna go to the into it but look at look at China so the bright blue there is the US declining since the early 50s in terms of relative standing the United Kingdom fell as the US was rising United Kingdom was bankrupted by World War one and New York Wall Street took over and we have some other players like the Netherlands which basically has been dying since 1650 but we really see the rise of China from a very deep trough back in 1950 so that that indicates quite a bit to me all right and then the various factors that talk about rise and decline for example and the last to go well the last to go is financial center but also reserve statuses remains high for a long time so basically reserve status the status of a currency as the world's reserve is the last to die and when it does it's pretty much toast for the rest and this is what happens is you start out with hard money on the left maximizes credibility means and minimizes credits so it's very credible but you're very hard to borrow against and that tends to limit an economy so then you go to claims on hard money mean somebody gives you a note that says I'm a banker and I've got a bunch of gold and here's a note that says you've got X amount of gold and then it turns into type through it's just fiat money fiat means let it be make it so as as you would say a star trek make it so money you can make as much as you want maximizes credit minimizes credibility that's what we have today where are we going back to hard money okay printing and devaluing money is the easiest way out of a debt crisis you are seeing these things now in response to the sending out of large amounts of money all currencies have been devalued or died over the roughly 750 currencies their existence is 1700 only about 20% remain and all have been devalued this is another very interesting one about how the u.s. basically is already devalued as a currency because we saw back in 17 well just about 1790 there the collapse of the Dutch Republic well we could say that we've we basically collapsed as of the inflationary 70s but we remained this reserve currency so not going again that large and growing debts etc you know and on the drill this is the typical big cycle you have a new world order that then grows grows grows and then gets a debt dust and goes into a new another new world order the next new world order and what is it China China is as I've discussed before on the show using its digital currency to compete with the US dollars it's basically a Chinese Bitcoin that they will control and believe me it's powerful because there's zero cost in sending it around they're already piloting it in a couple provinces in China so here's the simplified representation the Netherlands had it 200 your life cycle similar for Great Britain and similar for the US and now we have this the lines will cross we believe what you can do and with that I'm gonna actually play Roger James Hamilton's video because I think that's very very telling as a digital currency it can bypass banks it can be passed directly from one person to another and be fully tracked it has zero transaction cost and if we transfer it far faster than current fiat currency because it doesn't need a bank as a clearing agent now whether or not you believe all this gonna happen or not is better to be safe than sorry so here's five things that you can do right now to be able to protect yourself and profit from the coming crash the first thing is to diversify your cash itself there are many banks out there you can go to now that will actually set up multiple currency accounts for both my companies and also personally I have accounts in u.s. dollars in euros in yen in Australian dollars and Singapore dollars by splitting your cash it allows you to make sure that it wants to go down then you're still hedging your money against those that might still be going up the second thing is where your cash actually is stored do not be in a country where there's a chance that the banking system itself is going to collapse small copies with stable systems actually are better we've set up all of our accounts in Singapore because Singapore has been controlling not just a coronavirus but actually its entire economic system or through this crisis it's surprisingly easy to set up an account in Singapore or even set up a company in Singapore as well that's all you do just google it look for it and just don't assume that you have to keep all your money in your own country the third thing obviously is to diversify into assets which are hedged against the dollar they include gold silver Bitcoin and any asset where you know that if the dollar drops that these are assets are gonna grow in value the 4-step even more so than those assets are cash generating assets as many of you know right now we are focusing at an acquisition strategy where we are buying cashflow driven companies and what that does is allow us to make sure no matter what's happening to asset values we always are going to be growing our cash flow and the final thing is that itself when you know the crisis is going down taking more debt actually is a good thing if I have money in you arm and I have debt in u.s. dollars and the US dollar drops again so you're on it means relatively I owe less and ultimately with whatever strategy you choose the most important thing is answering this question would I be okay if the US dollar part and value once you've got a strategy where that works for you then you can just get on with your life knowing that even with the crash you're gonna be okay everything I've done everything we've done in the company has been set up for exactly that scenario the way to be crisis proof is know you can be okay in the crisis and the way to be crash proof is know you can be okay in a crash I'm with varied Ally on this I believe this is gonna be a two or three year thing before we see this happening maybe faster maybe slower and if it doesn't happen at all well we've lost nothing always better to be prepared for the worst and hoping for the best now by the way I've dropped all the links below to raise chapters if you'd like to go and read them I like this video if you have please click a like and do subscribe so that I can keep you up to date with all the latest that's happening as we go through this crisis and by the way if you're interested more I've done this video which allows you to see exactly how this crash is part of a three wave crisis from first of all consumer debt then corporate debt and then finally sovereign debt and another video about how this was all predicted in the fourth turning and exactly what we can be expecting in the coming years and with that I'm gonna leave you with this Ray Dalio quote which is about thinking about the big picture he says it's more important to do well that to me is a very powerful video but it's Roger James Hamilton dollar crash prediction is the name of the video and as I say we will publish what it is okay so why why did we show this of course you know I care about my family I know you care about yours and so we have something here that we think responds to number four which is this whole idea of having a cash flow investment now what's interesting is here we're developing a marketplace so that people can invest in water equipment which itself will be a cash flow asset right an asset that generates cash which is one of the five things that Hamilton proposes okay so here is what we call a corporate bond we're not offering stock it's not dependent upon the stock market why because when you redeem the principal and when you redeem a stock grant its price at the time you convert whatever the stock has done up or down it is what it is so it is your your in a corporate bond where you're paid twelve percent cash in stock and you get this back end what you're also doing is here's what's important you're building a thing itself that is a cash generating asset system which is the water marketplace and that to us is what you might call a double value here and it sound like it's the only one in the marketplace today you can make twelve percent on your money and there's this huge back end if you want to do the math on two years that we work out to about seventy five percent gains if you liquid it after two years which I'm not going to say you would and then of course is we can't guarantee there'd be the liquidity for it but it works out to about seventy five percent per year all in everything included if you cashed out after two years and that's without the stock doing anything with the stock going up it's all of the game so why are we doing this it's because you are the most important factor right now if you're an accredited investor or you are a foreign investor then you can get this offering and do very well with it to discuss it further I would like to propose that you speak to Ken behringer are amazing at architect of all this I blame him for everything and of course Devin Angus is the shareholder relations manager who is also my assistant and is a direct line to me you can email invested erosion clear calm and you can type O see gold / Ken for a call with Ken to beat him up about everything we've said here so Ken Baron just says please don't hesitate to set up resume call with me at OCC gold / Ken I will walk you through how you can participate a person who's named a note as it's probably a real person not note is not who they are I am from Chile I would like to get into I would like to look into this I'd like it to look into more details we can certainly help you and what's great about you from Chile is that you don't have to qualify as an accredited investor which is a great thing well that is all thank you very much Michaels what is maximum salinity their posture castaño for no scaling compatibility with microbes salinity will probably required an I think you're I'm right is saying adding reverse osmosis to handle the total dissolved solids the the system will work in certain saline situations and sea water situations it will have application goes to do see biological natural biological processes in ocean environments we're rocking out everything we do is geared sports primarily towards freshwater so that's where our focus has been Tom will tell we'll probably have some experience later on down the road when we have applications with saline environments yes right now we're dealing with organic waste sewage and that is that is the environment we're in right now ponds with algae or like retention ponds it's gonna have a future dealing with with things like red algae and green algae but also it's going to be primarily used for hog farm manure so very nasty stuff but generally organic with only trace amounts minerals and so forth that is correct good well thank you very much everyone I really appreciate it we're gonna wrap it up now as I'm starting to lose people it's been wonderful once again I love these these shows and love talking to you all thank you Tom for joining us as well and Dan it's been a pleasure have a great week enjoy your weekend stay safe for everyone [Music] you [Music]
