 hello everybody my name is parent aporia and I'm a product manager in the power of virtual agents team I am joined by my colleague Salem Barcia a senior developer on our team we have an amazing set of moderators who will be answering questions you may have so please feel free to ask him at any time my colleague Michael Chava will be conducting a live Q&A at the end of the presentation today's talk is about how developers can use low code extensibility to build world-class BOTS fast leveraging the full power of the power platform and the bot framework as DK specifically in today's session will show how developers can accelerate rapid development using Microsoft power virtual agents seamlessly extend with built-in low code support for the true no cliffs bot development experience and how developers can effectively collaborate with business users and subject matter experts to build intelligent powerful chat pods let's quickly introduce tools available to developers to build chat BOTS before we dive deep into a demo power virtual agents is Microsoft's latest no code low code hosted bot development platform it has been generally available since December 2019 and joins the ranks of other local power platform applications like power bi power apps and power automate for those that are new to the power platform it is these singular low code platform that spans office 365 dynamics 365 Azure and standalone applications power virtual agents is now enabling everyone subject matter experts and developers to effectively collaborate in building intelligent engaging and useful chat pods using our simple easy and intuitive conversation designer bot framework Composer is an open source visual authoring canvas for developers you can use it to design and build sophisticated conversational experiences using language understanding language generation and adapt dialogues all using open standards to unleash the full power of the underlying bar framework and he came it is generally available now I am truly excited to announce the we will add support for low code extensibility within power virtual agents using bot framework Composer with seamless integration with bot framework composer bought developers will be able to build dialogues that leverage the full power of the bot framework SDK and imported with empower virtual agents without needing to host any new infrastructure now let's get to the demo alright let us see how these two incredibly powerful tools work together to offer developers and bot offers a true no cliffs bot development experience let me set the stage we have built a bot that assists and engages with employees over teams John is a new employee at contoso he discovers a digital assistant in the team's app store and starts interacting with it it's John's first week at contoso his assistant knows who John is and prompts him to do the usual tasks any employee would do in their first week super helpful John's manager has asked him to complete all require trainings and schedule one-on-one meetings with a few people on the team John turns to the digital assistant for help John is impressed he now asked the assistant for more information about the people his manager has asked him to meet next John asks his assistant who his colleagues work with and finally John asks the assistant to schedule some one-on-one time with his new colleagues let's take a look at how we built this bot in this scenario there are two main topics that the bot is interacting with the user the first one is around required trainings and the second one is a directory search and employees within an organization I'll quickly build the first topper to to a tivities to get started in power virtual agents I create a new topic named require trainings next I add some semantically unique trigger utterances that I expect my end users asked this trains the underlying universal AI model to accurately trigger this dialogue bought authors can continue to work trigger utterances over time to further improve triggering accuracy I am now ready to start authoring my dialogue I am visually able to add nodes that ask questions show a message and even trigger an action my developer colleague has helped me by creating a new flow action in power automate using one of the three hundred-plus data connectors that I can seamlessly use in this conversation the first action needs the end-users access token which are exchanged for their role and team next ru as variables returned from prior actions into nodes or actions that follow you that is it I have now trained my bot to respond to users in this topic let us test it to make sure it is working as expected with built-in testing canvas support bought authors can trace through all steps of the conversation with empower virtual agents alright my next goal is to hook up directory search this is a sophisticated conversation and I need my developer colleague to help me with it today we enable Pro code developers to build remote skills that require them to setup a sure right code deploy and monitor their bought in their own subscriptions with low code extensibility we will enable Pro code developers to bring in dialogues authored in bot framework composure and executed within power virtual agents without needing to host any new infrastructure to show off our low code extensibility I've asked my colleague to author a set of topics built using bot framework composer and imported empower virtual agents with built in multi author support I have shared access to my bought with Salem Salem please go ahead thanks Paula I got the invite and now I'm signed into part virtual agents I'm going to adjust your need by authoring a set of topics in but from a composer which were announcing giant availability I build exciting stuff so to access it too with empar virtual agent I can go to manage composer topics and open bar from a composer here you go this is bought from a composer I can use this tool to build a set of topics that leverage the full power of the underlying bot framework declarative SDK for the sake of this demo I've already built a robot that uses Microsoft graph api's to search within my organization like for example who are my peers who's my manager schedule time with my colleagues etc so let me show you if you advance conversations that I authored here as you can see this pod has a bunch of dialogues and triggers let's deep dive into the who is trigger this triggers of an intent type where we are leveraging the language understanding schema to express trigger phrases and entities so once this flow is triggered will first add data to our BOTS memory specifically at the conversation scope level you can see here I'm filling in ten property with who is this will be relevant in a few minutes following along the flow will start executing the search person dialog so the first thing we want to do is authenticate the user and if this authentication was successful will store the token into the bots memory you can see here I'm using conditional expressions to branch my flow once again leveraging the bots memory I am sending an HP request to the graph API and storing back the response into the bots memory so I can later on use it in my flow so if you remember I stored the who is intent in my property before and now I'm using it to branch off in this switch statement since I triggered the who is intent I'm going into this flow here now I am ready to basically show the item back to the user which is basically the adaptive card of the person that we are searching for I am leveraging here the language generation to send back user responses I'll go over language generation later on and to this demo also I want to show you how we can leverage looping capabilities in our flow over here we are looping through every person I have stored into my memory and appending his work title to his action title and I'm sending this list back using our language generation schema you can see here I'm binding the bots memory into the response that we're sending back to the user language generation schema lets Bharatha is leveraged expressions and bought stored memory to create dynamic responses based on the conversation flow this is one example of how I can leverage expressions and the bots memory to create a dynamic response back to the user as well as as you can see here I can have multiple responses per template which allows the bot to randomly pick a response and send it back to the user this allows the bot to sound a bit more natural so today I can export this bot as a skill and host it into my Azure subscription and connected to par virtual agents the new capability we're introducing here is seamlessly adding these assets into part virtual agent and leveraging the underlying infrastructure setup and part virtual agent so now I have exported all the asses I've been showing you the language generation the dialog files and the language understanding files into one zip file I am now ready to import these topics back into power virtual agent so here we are validating the assets being imported by making sure all dependent files are there and that per virtual agent can actually execute these imported assets everything seems good and validated so now I'm ready to save these assets into the power of virtual agents content here you go I have successfully imported the who bot into our virtual agent you can see here these are the dialogues we were seeing before and bought from a composer and this is the search person dialog now as part of my content and I can use an impartial agent to search a person in my organization back to you bow on wow that is an advanced looking dialogue I am so glad that I have your help we make a great team we are going to further simplify this import experience in a future iteration I can now use this set of topics into any topic within power of virtual agents just like I did earlier I create a new topic name search topic and add some unique trigger utterances next I call the action from the composer topic we just imported because the underlying bot framework SDK is common between bot framework composer and para virtual agents I can seamlessly execute this topic in test this dialog within para virtual agents we run through the same dialogue that we saw over in teams when the conversation reaches this composer topic the underlying dialogue is executed seamlessly the control is passed back only when the underlying dialogue has finished you will be able to pass context to and from this dialogue just like you are able to do with any action the last thing I need to do is to enable this bot to respond over teams with a single click I can enable this bot on the teams channel and download the team's app package to publish this bot in the team's App Store and that's the end of the demo in summary we saw how power virtual agents accelerates chapo development through a fully hosted easy intuitive no code graphical experience our power virtual agents leverages the power platform and the 300 plus data connectors to quickly add back an integration and automation through a conversational experience para virtual agents offers a fully extensible no cliffs boat development experience with seamless integration with bot framework composer developers can now contribute without needing to host any new infrastructure Microsoft is uniquely empowering everyone to collaboratively build intelligent chat pods using our SAS and past students that's the end of our presentation I hope you have lots of questions for us Salem will be joining me now to answer them Michael what questions can we answer for our audience we've gotten a ton of great questions during the session so far and you're welcome to add more in the chat window I see that our traffic controllers have already addressed many of them let's take a look at some of these questions and have our speakers answer them so let's start with one question for Robin here when should we embed bot framework compose the topics in power of EI and when should we use primary skills in power game sure with composer topics there are three major differences one with bar framework skills you have to remotely host these skills so developers and organizations will have to maintain their own subscriptions and as your subscriptions to maintain these skills with composer topics they run natively with empower virtual agents so no need to host any new infrastructure the second thing is composer topics leverages the underlying Universal AI model so you should not need to host any new AR or Lin Lewis or any other place so you can run them just natively with with PVA and the last thing which I believe is the biggest advantage is you know the composer topics are just any other component within the but bought in application and so it leverage is the American package to solutions and can be exported from one environment to the other without needing to host it change URLs or endpoints so that's those are the three major differences between the two perfect thanks Pawan let's see there's a question from Janet for Salem what's the difference between bought from her composer built topics and bought framework skills yeah great question Michael so if you want to use a skill so if you already have a bot deployed on your a Shabbat service and you wish to integrate it with PVA that's where you basically simply convert that ball with the easy simple steps into a skill and you can currently right now integrate that through the skill mechanism feature and Bart virtual agents and and use it impart of virtual agents now if you want to do something very custom they require scored extensive on top of what favorite composers other box declarative support and you wish use some custom and a new processing that's where you want to go with the skills route now if you want if you don't want to host any infrastructure and leverage the full power of the PVA's and a new capabilities and have all the BOTS component including the newly added composer topics leverage the underlying application lifecycle of the management of the per virtual agent then I suggest using the new feature of embedding bar ferme and composer topics within barber to agent got it thanks a question for Pawan here from Dan can you support multiple languages in a bot yeah dan absolutely we are planning to support about 18 or so languages in the next few weeks so that is coming shortly perfect thanks Bonnie let's see a question for Salem here how does a developer test about former composer topic so currently the way you can test the bar ferme and composer topics once you import these composer topics into PVA you can leverage pv / virtual agents test canvas to test these newly added composer topics and also they power virtual agent topics have already been built there eventually you'll be able to test the entire project our virtual agents topics and composer topics via the emulator that is released by the bar everything got it and a question for Pavan what's the difference between virtual agents and Louis day I draw the different major difference between power virtual agents in Louis de AI is power virtual agents ships with a industry-leading universally I model pre trained to serve a power virtual agent NLU system so you don't have to explicitly go train as separate AI model all you have to do and your subject matter experts can do this very easily is simply add trigger utterances in your topics that will make your bot understand those topics over time with Louis you have to explicitly retrain the AI model and then plug it in with your and stitch it together with a with a custom-built bot got it thanks pollen and the question for sale and if I already build a bot with bot framework can I integrate that with our virtual agent yeah definitely that's something actually we currently support which is the skills feature so if you already have a bot a v3 bot or a v4 bot you can quickly convert that bot into a skill and use it and integrate that with by a virtual agent currently right now excellent uh interesting question for Pavan from Li what's the correct tool set to create a standalone bot for a user to interact with for example one that's not inside of teams I must say that to build a standalone bought I did not understand the question fully but I mean you can use power virtual agents to build a bot just by itself and then use our channel connections to connect to teams if you needed to okay we'll multi authoring be supported sim absolutely multi author is coming soon you saw a sneak peek of that in the demo we are truly excited about adding multi author capability it's coming soon all right and the first salem do you need any infrastructure to host the body depends which BOTS so if you're building about ephemeral but then yes you definitely do infrastructure to host the bot if you're using this new feature that we just don't do announced then you do not because you're leveraging the infrastructure of the power of virtual agent so once you embed these Composer topics with empower virtual agent you don't have to do any infrastructure hosting cut it and let's see question from Manasa for Salem when will compose a topics be available in PVA yes so great question so we're trying to be durable in October but we're planning on a public preview in August this great thanks a lemn a question for Pavan Kanpur virtual agents fall back to a live agent yeah we support generic hand off we support hand off to any engagement hub every every interaction with the with the bot can be captured into you know set of context variables that can be passed over to be hand off and that can be passed over to an engagement hub so we we are proud to support army channel as our first party integration to escalate to a human agent both contextually and seamlessly but developers can hook up any engagement hub should they want to thank Salem is their way to have a dev environment before pushing my bots our production environment great question Michael here yes - we can so using the application lifecycle management that we just actually introduced a part of virtual agent you can now import an export your bot that you just created from one environment to another and that way you can leverage that environment versus pod environment I think and let's see question for Pavan can we add new topics that are frequently added to a website absolutely so one of the key features that we have introduced is AI assistant authoring where you can go ahead and simply add a URL - you know as a suggested topics where your suggested topics may live and that then the AI essentially is going out scanning your web page extracting all the Q&A pairs and staging them as questions potential topics that the bot can answer with and so that is that feature is actually live today got it okay question from Merlin maybe for Salem is it possible to start proactive dialogues and a much firmer composure like in both framework SDK and believe so so technically the that's more of the Barham a question but since the ephemeral composer is actually leveraging the full power of the bar framework as decay under the hood then you can definitely basically leverage the proactive dialogues and a composer itself perfect and let's see this question for haben here will s SOP support it yes we are introducing support for single sign-on with Azure ad at this time in the next few weeks you should be able to get some notifications about that so yeah it will be supported soon perfect and a question from Guillermo to Salem can per virtual agents display at depth of cards certainly currently the way you can display adaptive cards with impart virtue agents is through leveraging skills to basically pass the adaptive card from the skill back to power virtual agent as well as there's a flow connector that basically sends an adaptive car to teams so you can leverage that but we are soon as well enabling adaptive cards natively empower virtual agent so stay tuned listen perfect question for Provence or somebody relators of what we talked about just a moment ago but a question I have a Bob building bot framework that does custom authentication for external users can my bot connect a partial agent behind the scenes yeah the beauty of the way we've architected the integration with skills is that the auth provider has to be is different between the barrel virtual agent bought and the integrated skill so if you were to connect your skill which has the custom earth with my ritual agents the auth flow is interrupted uninterrupted between the when the skill is invoked so for example you invoke the skill and the skill requires a special auth it has full control of the conversation and can complete the auth flow and and at that time PVA is basically just a blind relay so it should be possible perfect let's see question from soon koutou Salem what exactly is the difference between creating a chat bot you but firm against the kv-4 and but firmer composure how do you decide which of the two to use great question so using bot framework as dkv for the composer's actually leveraging the SDK under the hood so the composer the way you want to write a bot through composer is declarative way so you're actually not writing code you're writing declarative JSON files and markdown files to create that bot now you can also leverage the coding patterns to create a bot so using javascript or c-sharp for example so it's up to you which one you're comfortable for if you don't want to write a lot of code then you can go through the composer but eventually they're both the same thing under the hood thanks Pamela so it looks and we have just a couple of minutes left so before you wrap up the session so let's you can get one more question and a question for Pavan so all the things we saw in the in the demo video when is this going to be in public preview and generally available yeah Salem touched on this a little bit public preview is going to be in August of this year and then you know generally available in October we're very excited to release this as quickly as possible for you guys all right I think that's all we have questions in terms of questions so hand it back Department to close us out thank you Michael we are truly pushing the limits to democratizing AI for everyone to build conversational experiences with power virtual agents digital transformation is just a few clicks away I can't wait to see what you end up building thank you thank you
