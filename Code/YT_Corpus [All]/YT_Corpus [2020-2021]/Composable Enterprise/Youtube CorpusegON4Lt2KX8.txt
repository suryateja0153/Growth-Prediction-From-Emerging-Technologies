 from around the globe it's thecube with digital coverage of vmworld 2020 brought to you by vmware and its ecosystem partners welcome back i'm stu miniman this is thecube's 11th year of vmworld here we are in 2020 of course rather than being together at the moscone or at the sand we're coming to you in your place of work or home while you're watching video uh happy to welcome back we have two of our longtime guests on the program first we have travis v hill he is the senior vice president of product management with dell technologies and joining him is lee caswell who's the vice president of products storage and availability business unit at vmware liam travis thanks so much for joining us thank you stu it's good to see you again all right so we we love kind of the maturation of what's happened you know i mentioned 11 years i get to usually you know sit down and talk with both of you we talk about strategy we talk about how customers and at the end of the day we know you know things are changing heck 2020 things are changing more uh every day but one of the big transitions here is talking about that how applications are changing in the old days it was hey i have an application let me just stick it in a vm and it's going to be good there forever we know that today i i need to be able i react fast i need to move things forward and that impacts what vmware and dell are doing together so mate lee if maybe we come with you uh give give the vmware perspective on you know that application changing and what that means uh to there and you know travis feel free to chime in when lee's done sure yeah thanks so much stu and uh great to have uh to be back here on thecube uh and vmworld is always a great opportunity to talk about how the industry is changing what's what's really uh happening here and so one of the things that we're all finding is that the pace of application change is speeding up and you know what when you think about infrastructure we want to think about how you can organize around the fastest changing element this is one of the things we kicked off with project pacific and our tanzu portfolio a year ago and you're starting to see all the products come roaring through right now as we're integrating kubernetes so that container-based applications can be managed secured protected just the same way with all the same tools that we have with our traditional vm applications yeah you know lee it's it's it's a uh it's an excellent point i mean we are seeing the adoption of the modern applications um in vmware environments just accelerate beyond belief and we're getting increasing uh requests from our customers to protect uh to manage production workloads in kubernetes environments and with our power protect data manager we're actually announcing that we have full support for the tanzu portfolio so that includes tkg tkgi uh kubernetes clusters kubernetes clusters and vsphere um so we're we're really excited to be able to offer this capability to our joint customers and um you know i think one thing that we're seeing is that that the roles in it you know are are oftentimes uh blending together so one of the things we're excited about with our solution is that with our direct data protection integration and sp vsphere environments it's actually the v admin that can provision monitor manage and protect the kubernetes workloads give you know a unified experience and provide that that peace of mind in in this next generation world yeah travis i i'm glad you brought up some of those changing roles i mean that was such a big theme for so many years is the virtualization admin taking on more responsibility lee teed up the changing applications you've got other roles coming together you've got the application development team uh which often times is disconnected from from the infrastructure team uh so for from either of you just you know what are you seeing from your customers how are they sorting through that you know i need to move agile i need to move faster um and that's not traditionally how how the infrastructure team is has worked yeah one of the things that we've been working on for example is how we've integrated srm with vvols and and powermax and when you think about that you know and we've talked for years right about uh vvols for example what we're responding to now is that customers are coming back and saying listen i i have hci but i also have storage system and i need your help to go and be able to manage these with a consistent operating model and the same team and that career path for the virtualization administrator just continues to grow you know they're adding now a lot of native applications kubernetes orchestrated applications and being able to manage those across traditional storage and newer hci systems this is a really interesting blend of where the companies are working together to make sure that customer responses are being addressed really quickly yeah it's it's a great a great example lee i mean if you think about you know three-tier architectures and power max being the flagship of the heart of a lot of you know data centers that have been up you know in operation for for decades the fact that we're we're seeing from our customers hey can you take uh srm and v-vols can you integrate it with powermax and srdf and be able to provide me a step along the way on my modernization journey such that i can utilize what i've built up my it operations about around over you know over the last couple of decades along with the newer deployment models like hyper-converged infrastructure and we're seeing that kind of that kind of you know that that uh step forward um and and a blurring of the lines in terms of roles all all over the place i think another good example lee is uh uh cloud native app death right and customers looking for object uh s3 object storage capability uh to provide a simple devops friendly way of uh you know developing applications and hybrid cloud environments and that's why we're really happy that we're able to uh provide early access for what we refer to as object scale which works in conjunction with vsan data persistence platform to allow our customers to deliver modern applications but at the same time use infrastructure that the it organization is deploying you know for for other standard applications i think that's another good example that's a good point you know we had blocks through vsan of course right and added files uh what was missing well objects so exactly by partnering together with this persistent storage platform we've got a way to go and basically supply object scale or you know object skill storage that can be used for cloud native development and i think this is a good example right this isn't just you know one hand clapping right this is both companies working together to make sure that customers have a seamless experience and that's really important it doesn't come for granted right i mean it really takes co-engineering joint testing and developing and go to market together between our companies i've never seen it working better well yeah go ahead stephen yeah no travis i was just uh you know saying you know we we saw how fast vmware went from announcing project pacific to you know the ga of the base solution where you needed the cloud foundation uh to you know update one already allowing everything to move open that's gonna be a little bit challenging to keep up with that pace of innovation you know we've been talking for years on the cube but you know we went from the 18-month release cycle to now most things are like a six-week release cycle um so you know give us through you know any other pieces the portfolio we need to understand uh the fitting with tanzu and yeah how do you move things along and where are the customers with their adoption are they sitting there waiting for it or is this something that is going to be a more traditional enterprise uh you know slow roll no i think you i think you hit it spot on stu the the adoption and the deployments of these these new uh architectures are are coming very very quickly right traditional i.t is is you know trying to to to and in many cases successfully moving to a more cloud-like delivery uh cicd approach to how they run their their shops and the you know the speed of innovation and the speed and the the dynamics of of new technologies within the data centers are just you know accelerating uh you know at a really fast pace um and in order to you know continue to keep up with these changes it's you know i'll reflect back on a little bit on what what lee was talking about it's understanding where customers are going and jointly working together to target those pain points and i'll give you know a very specific example and then i think maybe lee we should start to talk a little bit about monterey as well but you know i'll say a very specific example example on on joint innovation is um you know as customers have deployed uh vmware more broadly and they put more mission-critical large applications on vm there's been sort of this persistent issue that some of those vms just were so large or required such high availability that they were you know what some it uh professionals would refer to as um as as unproductive unprotectable and so we were actually demonstrating with vmware innovation that allows those those vms those large mission critical vms that can take zero you know downtime or even a pause in in availability or performance the ability to uh to take backups without impacting the performance on those on those vms so that's a very specific thing we're doing a very specific pain point um but i think it's an example of us working together to target customer uh customer needs and then i think more broadly there's a big trend in composability that pat talked a little bit about this morning uh project monterey i'll let lee kick it off and then kind of talk a little bit about what we're doing to uh to partner with vmware on this uh on this initiative yeah well great i definitely want to hear monterey obviously edge computing has everybody excited you know travis we've been hearing from the dell team the last couple of years as that strategy's maturing some of the investment pieces that dell's doing so lee you know we hear edge computing what does that mean you you know vmware's got a strong telco play that we've watched uh you know for for many years um so you know just as you said project pacific rolled out pretty fast uh help us understand a bit more this monterey and how fast what will this turn into that that cascade of products that you talked about uh for that we saw the last year yeah thanks and it's exciting at vmware right we're willing to go and share projects and you know over time projects become products that's the way it works and so the project is really a directional vision that says if you think about what we did with project pacific a year ago and pacific being like going broad the idea was applications are changing we needed to go and basically make kubernetes integrated with vsphere with our full vmware cloud foundation and then basically simplify it for customer consumption and we did that together with the tanzu brand now project monterey if you think of the monterey canyon is now going deep and what it says is that not only the software architecture has to change but also hardware new hardware capabilities particularly through the use of smart nics are a new way for us to think about re-architecting how compute is basically optimized within a server and then across clusters and even across the hybrid cloud and so monterey will be a new way to look at how we go and efficiently offload cpus and use these new smart nic offload engines as a way to think about where hypervisors run where smart you know let's call it software defined whether it's storage or compute and most importantly probably is security because one of the things we're finding that applications new applications are demanding is encryption for example or distributed firewalls thinking about like how do we do that secure boot or how do we think about air gapping applications from the infrastructure and so we're really thinking about how to re-architect the world of security so the security is integrally distributed throughout an architecture and so you'll be seeing with project monterey our ability to go and drive new products out of that and we're working very closely on an engineering to engineering level with dell technologies to make sure this new technology becomes available for customers and fully integrated in the vmware cloud foundation so we have an easy way for customers to digest it which i i think that's the thing to stu right now is there's a lot of new technologies coming so fast really the partnership means that we're able to consume those more quickly wonderful yeah monterey so we're going to go deeper than the grand canyon is deep but i i guess we need to all uh you know breathe underwater too so travis uh as i mentioned you know dell's had for a couple of years some of these analyst sessions uh that i've had the opportunity to go through uh been watching out that that growth of the the edge strategy uh obviously you know dell has everything from some of the hardened pieces on the consumer side through tying into you know broad ecosystems so software obviously is going to be a huge component of of what edges we saw in the keynote stage nvidia you know a big partnership there obviously a huge important partner for for both uh dell and uh vmware so travis from the dell side what is what does this vision of monterey mean it's you know it's uh extremely important you know i'd say transformational potentially uh for it going forward and lee did a really good job of describing the trends whether that be cloud native telco 5g uh you know machine learning and data centric applications multi-cloud and hybrid cloud and that security concern that that lee was talking about those are those are our real trends and if we can offer infrastructure that is more composable into these these disaggregated resources uh you know across the edge across the cloud across the core all software-defined and seamlessly managed i mean that's a powerful powerful vision and we're just really excited to be partnering with vmware jointly engineering this future focusing first on those smartnics that lee was talking about because you need that higher compute you need that increased bandwidth you need easier manageability of a distributed infrastructure and you need that ability to provide easier and more distributed security so lots more to come we will be incorporating these technologies specifically in the form of smartnix into our hci and our server portfolio um but this like lee said this is a trend that will move from initiative to project to products very quickly wonderful well boy we we covered that that breadth and that depth as you said lee want to give you both just final takeaways what you want people to take uh from vmworld 2020. lee will start with you and then travis you get the final word yeah you know we're really looking at a changing world in terms of applications and so for customers you know around the globe uh you know look for the partnerships that will bring those new capabilities and make it easy to go and deploy as fast as possible you know we started off making sure that people weren't looking down at the infrastructure and started looking up at the apps uh we're continuing that process with what we're doing around tanzu around our kubernetes portfolio and you know stay tuned there'll be more to come much more as we work together on project monterey lots of exciting news and uh you know glad that you were here for vmworld to go and see it all come to light yeah i think you know i obviously agree with with everything that that lee just said you know i think i think for me um the this vm world is just you know another step forward in a great partnership across dell technologies and vmware um and you know i mentioned several things you know all of the things that we're doing together um you know i i forgot to mention actually that we're the first company to be uh to offer a certified solution uh to protect vmware cloud foundations which i use that specific example again you know expect more first uh expect more joint in engineering and integrations and you know i think the power of these uh of these two organizations coming together is what's going to be needed to help drive forward into this next generation of modern applications and and dynamic workloads and and disaggregated resources um and so we're just really excited about um the innovation uh the ability to address customer issues and the the you know and the strong partnership that we have across dell technologies and vmware well one of the measurement sticks that we have today is how fast everyone can can respond and move fast uh congratulations on all the progress you've both made in your teams in the last year and absolutely i look forward to hearing more about project monterey as that as that matures travis and lee thanks for joining us thank you stu thanks stu all right stay tuned for more coverage of vmworld 2020 i'm stu miniman as always thank you for watching thecube you
