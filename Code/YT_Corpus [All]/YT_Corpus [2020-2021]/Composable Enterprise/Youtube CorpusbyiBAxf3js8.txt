 (soft music) One of the things that our customers tell us that they love, and frankly they don't believe about HPE Primera, is our 100% data availability guarantee. That's right. So here's the thing. Most customers will come to me and say, "Hey, data availability guarantee sounds great. First off, everyone has some kind of program but there's usually a very long terms and conditions. You have to sign your life away." But the reality is with the 100% data availability guarantee there's three basic things. First is subscribe to InfoSight. There's enough value in there already, plenty of insights to help you run your business. The second is be at a proactive support contract, pretty standard, and then as long as you're following patching best practices, if you experience anything other than 100% data availability then we'll make it right by you. Before you say that it's all marketing fluff, the thing you have to realize is that we're an engineering company. For us to be able to come out to you and say, "Hey, here's our commitment, here's our value proposition, here's our offer," we have to be very confident in the work that our engineers do, the products that they deliver. And we are. And so customers are happy because we are actually putting skin in the game, in their success, with the 100% data availability guarantee. (soft music)
