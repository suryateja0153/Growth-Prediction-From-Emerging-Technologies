 Today the world looks completely different. Digital transformation is not an option, it's a requirement. And Hewlett Packard Enterprise is helping organizations of all sizes navigate and accelerate their digital transformation journey. When we had this pandemic come through, one of the things that came to mind is I hope we can continue to have our platforms reliable and consistent. And that's what we got. We use supercomputing to solve this health crisis and we will. These new technologies allow us to push our decision-making closer to the edge. Add AI to this and we are starting to have a really powerful toolkit to start predicting the future. And some people think that this is not possible. Now it's a reality. First day opening, we had zero tickets, zero problems. It was a big day for us. When we make our services affordable, we really free them up to connect with the rest of the world and explore. In today's ever changing business environment, everybody needs to have the ability to react fast. The HPE GreenLake environment of Auckland Council allows us to have the flexibility to scale up and scale down to suit whichever business requirement gets thrown at us. The world has to move towards renewable energy. And with the advent of supercomputers, we can now do all this testing virtually. We didn't have high-performance computers. We couldn't do the science at all. We are using very sophisticated AI tools to probe the data. Help preserve this diverse, beautiful planet for future generations. HPE is helping customers deliver the right business outcomes from all their data. From edge to cloud because we have the right strategy, technology, expertise and partners. HPE, the edge to cloud platform as a service company.
