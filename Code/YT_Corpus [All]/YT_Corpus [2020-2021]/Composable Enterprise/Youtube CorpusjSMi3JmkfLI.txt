 yourself so the end of our session today is to provide a bit of an insight around some of the challenges we're seeing around managing financial risk and reducing fraud but then also delving a little deeper into our solutions to look at some of the aspects such as the technology unification some of the back office technologies and nan's going to give us a great demonstration around the fraud protection capabilities and then we'll bring all the parts back together and summarize and bring out some of the next steps that we'd like to focus into so let's start with some of the challenges that we're seeing out there around managing financial risk and what we're actually starting to think about in terms of some of the serious roadblocks that are out there now historically there's still quite a lot of legacy systems out there that are a little bit outdated and their data is quite fragmented in terms of where that data actually sits so there's got a lot of data silos leading to perhaps some static reports which can of course lead to some untimely business decisions of course but also there's a growing range of regulatory requirements in terms of localizations as well that we're all having to try and manage and this digital threat around our data especially this year is becoming more and more pertinent to identifying ways of success economy so from our lens we're looking to try and help unblock some of the business continuity that is out there and try and help with some predictive and proactive ways of utilizing our financial operations and it kind of comes together in three pillar activities really we've got the aspects around the data how we can leverage data from the perspective of performance where we want to try and provide some time or actionable insights around our financial data the performance metrics and maybe identify some future outcomes through some insights that we can provide for a level of prediction but there's also about activities relating to how we can continuously deliver our solutions through our platform that can then enable your own people to start innovating with the solutions that are around and i'll touch on a number of that aspects in a moment and then we've got the protection level how do we help guard your revenue as a solution from those credit card authorization challenges that we do sometimes experience leading through to how we can in effect improve that customer experience and from a microsoft dynamics 365 perspective these are really being underpinned by three business application areas of finance fraud protection and human resources but to relate to it in more detail i want to try and bring it all together in terms of a particular ecosystem now this slide is fairly busy but it does bring everything together in terms of what we need to talk about towards the bottom segment we've got an area known as technology unification and within this we can see a host of capabilities around how we would manage a client to the user access through to how we might even manage the application itself through to automation and across into some integrations but then we've got the middle area where we've got those business application aspects from finance to our workforce which in effect is hr and how we can bring capabilities across budget and cash management together and drive out those perhaps those actionable insights from a financial management perspective and then we've got those kind of channels and key stakeholders about how we are to engage with our data whether it be you know from a customer lens where we are being interacting from an e-commerce engine through to maybe our vendors that are leveraging a port to where we're connecting directly or indeed an employee portal these are all kind of key channels and stakeholders where we may need to share our data so let's go a little deeper down into the technology unification aspect and in particular i want to kind of bring together some philosophy of how we can unify your technology so you know systems can be quite um innovative and you know but we need to also then provide a seamless level of managing your implementation and so we have an effective way of leveraging something that we call life cycle services for the finance and hr capabilities that enable you to manage your implementation not just from the actual production instance or any sandboxes that are in play but also from a governments you know what methodology might you be following yourselves in conjunction with a partner of course with microsoft as well all of which enables you to start delivering a solution and building against and a range of agile capabilities through these cloud services and because we've kind of enabled it through this particular lens it enables you to effectively start to drive activity around data i'm going to dig into that in a little bit more detail at the moment but when i've got that data in place that i'm effectively managing those processes it enables you to then start thinking about how you can personalize your experience whether that is providing automation or customizing the user experience even further because at the end of the day we're looking to help you manage your risk and provide a productive productive environment so when i was touching on the unified data there's one aspect here that i need to touch deeper on and this is a capability of how we can start to leverage other areas like say the dynamics 365 in conjunction with the power platform and from a finance lens perspective there's two capabilities around dual rights and virtual entities so the dual rights is a capability that enables us to empower master data to interact directly with this common data service that can be leveraged with power platform and other applications and then we're in fact exposing all of our entities virtually into the cds so that you can do that kind of create that update that delete type processes that you need to be doing to leverage your data and then once you've got your unified set of information in one place from your finance system that enables you to then go that step further of how you can start to evolve those traditional processes and perhaps start to leverage capabilities from within the power platform such as power automate which could say take an example of you know a credit limit for a customer has been exceeded that could be a business event trigger that you need to leverage to maybe update other parts of the software maybe to notify individuals and basically drive a a rich query off the back of that to interact with some other element of your digital landscape you've got that sort of scope in place but at the same time we've got our data on one location which means we can start to also leverage insights through the business intelligence capabilities of power bi power bi dashboards and reports can be embedded directly within finance and you actually get a host of these automatically with the solution which you can then tailor and customize to suit which means you can then start to drive insights that go beyond just transactional data you can actually start to leverage some observational data from the broader cds solution that exists across the portfolio of the applications and that can start to help drive a bit of a data culture where every employee can start to help make decisions based on you know real-time data now when we're looking at employees there's also the breadth of how we might represent a client to them yes there's a full web-based client that they can leverage but we often are needed to provide uh scalable mobile applications as well and there's a number of ways that we could do that whether it could be through the powerapp capabilities of the power platform which is a leveraging a no code load code app approach or through leveraging a point-and-click workspace designer that is part of finance to provide some quite straightforward and simple user experiences or leveraging experiences that we've pushed out to say the google store or the apple stores that ask for specific scenarios or use cases such as maybe managing you know a lot of detail of information around say a time sheet where you have a lot of rich information being presented to an individual straight away so all of this unification of data and the technologies through the cds with the finance system also then enables you to go that step further because this is a composable architecture after all which is enabling you to interact with other solutions whether it be from a supply chain perspective or another application you can push information or receive information via a whole host of connectors through from one system to another and so what we're looking to try and do all the time is enable dynamics to work smoothly and effectively across your organization through a host of deployment options and i'll touch a little deeper on those in the moment through a range of the security capabilities around role-based activity you know individuals that could be a procurement clerk are going to see quite a different set of workspaces and experiences to say a credit controller and by deploying this across the globe you know we're at microsoft are having to always ensure we're meeting a host of regulatory and localization standards to enable you to then continue to be able to get that a little bit deeper around any customizations or addressing particular business needs that you may well have and finance as a solution can be deployed through a you know an accredited partner network that could also work in conjunction with our microsoft fast track service which is going to help you uh realize some uh business value and drive the right sort of business processes that are appropriate for you now i touched on the regulatory perspectives and there is a host of standards that we are always looking to adhere to and there's a breadth of global government and industry-based standards that we look to meet and to see the full detail of all of these you can go across to the microsoft trust center just pop that into your browser and look at the compliance details and you'll see the breadth of what we are covering against those individual standards and localizations and a great one that kind of comes to mind as well is around the gdpr compliancy you know from a microsoft perspective you know we believe privacy is a fundamental right and we've believed the gdpr the general data protection regulation is an important step and we provide that capability as reporting tools directly within the finance solution so that you can address any say mandatory personal data breach reporting that you need to do and avoid any significant penalties that could occur if you weren't fulfilling that and i also attached on the deployment aspect now this is where we can also go that a little bit deeper around um you know what type of cloud deployment global is it go local is it sovereign so sovereign is where we're looking at it from an isolated global cloud perspective local data centers meeting specific requirements such as markets in say china and we've got the go local cloud perspective which is data centers which are looking at it from a country border deployed within a latency defined boundary for synchronous replication of data for areas like disaster recovery in countries like france and india are great examples of that and then the map on the right hand side there is showing you the breadth of where we are deploying and when we are deploying we're always looking to provide a kind of guaranteed uptime level of service which we are managing in our data centers through the lifecycle services environment that i touched on earlier that is addressing those particular sandbox requirements of a uat testing box through to a a box that might be used by a developer for any form of customization so you can explore apply a review before them being updated to your live production environment which is hosting your finance solution so i've touched on a range of the kind of the technology unification elements there but i also want to focus in a little bit more around some of the ongoing elements that have occurred this year for finance for us and in particular i'm interested in talking about the fact that you know we've got a configurable globalization engine now that is helping organizations across you know 37 countries and regions that microsoft directly is is helping and there's also a host of localizations that are being provided on top of that for um solutions that are going beyond by our app source engine so you're going to microsoft app source and you can explore those accordingly um this is an ongoing need and that you know this year alone in the next wave of our solution we've added in a host of new localization capabilities bahrain hong kong kuwait oman are just some examples of the the new localizations that have been incorporated as well as the continuous update programs that are in there and we've also seen a huge increase in the range of me invoicing capabilities that we need to be providing the type of transaction types that are whether it be a customer invoice to a credit note we've had to simplify that process through the document management capabilities which we've done and that has now enabled people to start you know generating secure confidential and authenticated um transactions between organizations and this continues to be a need for us around that regulatory reporting and auditing capability that you know by region or localization you need to be providing for you know a host of reporting needs which you can do as a power user you can take what we have as our core solution and then in effect you know expand upon it for any particular uh market need that might go beyond our core solution so across the board there i've just been touching on the you know a range of the capabilities of how we can help manage the financial risk bring together the unification of your data to try and help manage and control that ongoing need around your financial solution now i want in a moment to pause and pass control across to anand who can then take us further into how we can help protect and guard your revenue against fraud thank you kevin uh my name is anand oka i am a partner group program manager here in business applications group at microsoft and i would like to take the next 10 15 minutes to talk with you about a product called dynamics fraud protection which can help you guard your revenue against fraud and mitigate your fraud losses so in order to kind of explain this product i need to give you a little bit of a background about what is what has been happening with digital transformation so obviously digital transformation has enabled businesses to impact their entire customer journey the way they engage with their customers and as you know the the journey basically has three phases there is an identity phase there is a phase where actual purchases happen commercial transactions and there is also a post-purchase you know reverse logistics phase so in the identity phase the merchant or the business is now able to encourage his customers to sign up in large numbers you know they businesses want to encourage their customers to sign up as uh as easily as they can and they want to encourage them to make frequent and uh many visits to their portal and uh interact with their porter because that's the way to get them interested in your product lineup in the purchase phase the merchant wants to encourage his customers to shop as frequently as they can and he wants to make the shopping experience as smoothless as smooth and as pain-free as as as it can be and in the last phase in the post-purchase phase in order to earn customer loyalty uh the business wants to make sure that its customers can get the post-purchase service that they deserve also in a very smooth and frictionless manner for example they should be able to do returns and refunds without no hassle and that engenders loyalty they come back to buy more from you so obviously daily transformation has been helping with this journey and making each of these steps steps very easy and frictionless but it has had a kind of a side effect also which is that it has made the life of fraudsters also easy they can now attack all these three phases of the customer journey more easily and they can actually cause a lot of damage for example in the identity phase because it's so easy to create online accounts fraudsters will create a lot of fake accounts and they'll abuse this facility to get offers and rewards that are meant for new users or for example in the payment space you know when you're actually buying something online process will use stolen instruments to buy and pay for things that they buy and later of course there's a charge back you know there's a dispute and the payment has to be given back to the to the bank because it was not authorized on that card and so that obviously causes fraud losses for the business or the merchant and lastly in the post-purchase phase because the business has made it easy to do returns and refunds uh processors can actually abuse that and actually get refund returns and refunds when they actually don't they're not eligible to do so and in fact that can result in a lot of losses too so really the aim of this product which i'm gonna talk to talk with you about now is really to help the customer holistically fight all these uh phases of customer fraud in all the phases of the customer journey across identity purchase and post purchase so the product has three capabilities uh the first cup ability is called account protection and the aim here is to really stop fake accounts from being created and detect account compromises early so that you can protect your reputation and your customer experience the second capability of the product is purchase protection and the aim here is to really stop fraud from happening during the purchase phase the payment phase and do it in such a way that you don't actually stop or hurt your loyal legitimate customers and loss prevention is more of an anomaly detection mechanism where you look back on sets of transactions that have happened in store especially around discounts and refunds and then you detect clusters of anomalies you know of patterns which kind of signify that there is something anomalous with it and they can be investigated and mitigating action can be taken typically that fraud involves you know point-of-sale terminals and employees in-store who may give returns who may allow discounts and returns which are not eligible so if you look at if you take a step back and look at the product and ask what are the major product features that really differentiated in the market and make it a compelling proposition uh it's really kind of uh you can speak of those product features in two levels there are product features which are common they are shared across all the three capabilities i described earlier and then there are product features which are specific to that each capability because it specializes to this special need of that kind of fraud so the common capabilities are the following uh this product is extensively based on ai and it's not just a regular kind of ai artificial intelligence but it's really a new breed of ai called adaptive intelligence where the aim is to learn fraud patterns on the go and always be immunized sort of so to speak so that you can detect and protect yourself from against evolving patterns uh this ai works against a very big uh and comprehensive source of knowledge called the fraud production network where we combine data from all our customers in a compliant and uh privacy prisoning way but the aim here is to really get a global uh view of how fraud and non-fraud events are happening so that we can better discriminate the two and give good service to good customers at the same time make sure that we are able to stop uh fraud in its track the third common capability is device fingerprinting this is basically the ability to collect signals from the device the client which is used to actually make purchases or login into accounts and things like that and this allows us to really understand how devices are used across different portals and it really is a very important tool in the fight against fraud and finally the final big capability that we have in the engine is called a decision engine and the aim of this capability is really to allow the customers to run configure and run rules of their choice in in a very fast and performant way so that you can make decisions based on the machine learning score and all the other data that you're sending to the service so these are common capabilities all all the different uh parts of the product share them and then each of the specific capabilities like account protection purchase protection and loss prevention they have some special sauce and i won't go into each of them right now but for example if you look at purchase protection there is a special sauce there that we only we in the market today have and that's called a transaction acceptance booster this is an ability for the merchant to actually send certain kinds of trust data to the bank in real time when the transaction is happening which allows it allows the merchant to have a better chance of getting his transaction accepted so it basically allows you to capture more revenue similarly there's a customer's escalation support tool which allows uh the merchant to actually serve and mitigate any kind of customer escalation related to risk rejects you know if legitimate customers are getting stopped because of risk reasons uh through the support tool the merchant can unblock those customers we have a lot of other capabilities as you see in account protection we have bot protection on the loss prevention side we have automated discovery which is the anomaly detection piece and uh so there's a lot of detail in each of these capabilities i won't be able to touch on all of them but just kind of have this sense that uh this is a very comprehensive ai based uh product and each aspect of the product actually utilizes specialized ai to unlock and stop fraud and unblock customers in that particular scenario you know i just touch upon this because this is a developer community this is something you would definitely appreciate this is a product that is built natively on azure so we use azure compute vms across the world in geos across the world view azure storage we us we use azure networking and communications infrastructure so it is really you know it is really built ground up on azure natively but at the same time it also enables your cloud story so in the product we have capabilities and i'll demo them shortly where you can export data through things like event tracing and then you can take that data out and export it to event hubs you can send it to blob storage or adls and things like that and then you can run your own analytics and your own workloads on that and this is very critical because fraud protection not just stops fraud right at the gate during in the real time transaction phase but all those analytics that you're getting from our insights can be further used to change your you know processes or take further actions to improve the efficiency of your system so this is really an important piece of the puzzle um i won't spend too much time on architecture here uh but it's worthwhile calling out one example of how dfp works this is how the fraud purchase protection capability works so the idea here is that the the merchant's customer who is the shopper will be coming to your portal the merchant supporter and trying to uh he or she will try to make a purchase or maybe do a refund or something like that when that event is happening the merchant will make in real time a call to our service and send us a certain transaction payload and at the same time our service will automatically pick up certain kinds of data from the device of this user via this technology called device fingerprinting and then we will reason over this data using ml in in a very quick uh and fast in our own manner so literally within a few hundred milliseconds we'll be able to produce an answer and an answer is saying basically whether what is the risk of that transaction it's like a probability and then we also provide certain risk reasons which explain why we came to that conclusion now using that risk assessment and using all the data that the merchant had sent us including the transaction payload and the device fingerprinting data the merchant can then use all that data and the risk assessment in the rules engine that i told you about earlier and it can the merchant can make a decision allow or reject the transaction now if the merchant allows the transaction it will go over the standard offset flow to the bank for collecting the money you know against the credit card but while that is happening we will also send a certain packet of data to them to the bank in real time and this packet is called trust knowledge and the aim of this packet is really to convince the bank to accept the transaction with higher probability by providing them certain important pieces of information like the trust the risk or certain information around the device certain information uh around the location of the transaction and so forth and this is really a secret sauce as i told you earlier this is something that we uniquely have in the market today and it really it helps improve the authorization rate of the transactions so uh enough said in terms of slide aware let me show you a few quick demos i really want to demo you the the rules creation and even interesting part of the product because this is something that developers love and this really kind of gives you the power to do many more workloads by taking data out of the product as well as confirming or configuring configuring the rules engine to do the exactly the kind of decisioning you want to do so first of all you can create rules in a very standard uh you know developer friendly format with intellisense so there's completions uh there is context provided for the different kinds of commands that you can write but basically the idea is that you write clauses conditions which trap different kind of scenarios and then you can create actions saying that when such and such condition is met then take this action so the conditions could be that hey this is a consumer segment in a particular geo and the risk assessment score is so and so and in that case you accept or reject the transaction or challenge it or send it for manual review but we don't stop there obviously right we want to make life as easy as possible so first of all you need to be able to create rules and save them as drafts this is very important because you can put a rule in production but you can also create a version which is ready to go into production if the need be and this happens often during holiday seasons where fraud managers want to create like backup rules saying that if fraud spikes i want to put this new rule into production for that segment and so we give that capability to create rules and save them as drafts this is something that developers really love because that gives them a lot of control on how to use our product uh then we have something called rules templates where you know we give you a lot of help in terms of how you can set up your rules and then you can modify them and expand them further as you need for example like geofencing is a common scenario that is uh that comes across in lot of these uh fraud related uh applications and aim that they really is to prevent a transaction from happening if it is not from the right geo uh you know you know for example the store is located in one country and the device is located in a completely different country you want to stop that from happening so we give you a template out of the box and you can take that template and put it in production or you can update it further with your specific clauses we give you a pretty solid rules debugging experience on the right hand side you can see there's a sample payload you can consume that sample payload in the rule as it is being returned and actually if the rule doesn't execute and you know properly if it executes into a failed condition it will actually show it as red so you will know that hey this rule is not syntactically correct but not just that you can actually use that uh in the previous case you can actually use that sample payload and the the attributes that you're seeing there will actually be consumed in the rules and they'll actually evaluate over that attribute set so you can actually see that the rule is executing properly or not uh we have things like custom lists where the idea is that we give you the ability to set up extensive lists of known entities like trusted email addresses trusted ip addresses trusted domains and things like that and you can actually do membership kind of conditions in the rules uh when you're executing the rules for example if a certain ip address belongs to a trusted list you know maybe allow it to happen with higher probability you know or give it like a better you know an easier path forward like a manual review and things like that and finally uh we have this notion of payload evaluation as i said you can actually evaluate against a known payload and in fact you can actually go and update the payload here you can actually change this quantities right on the fly and you will see the rule evaluating with that change payload so you can see how the variation is affected by the values of the payload this is a very powerful capability it's almost like an interpreted language if you want to think about it like that and finally we have this notion of event tracing as i said the idea here is to really give the ability for you the developers to export uh not just all the data that you send to dfp but all the insights that dfp produce in terms of in terms of the scores and the machine learning risk reasons and things like that and you can send them all out to a location of choice like an event hub and every each and every transactions and we are talking about millions of transitions that may happen in a day you can send them out to that source and then you can run your workloads there and you can actually execute further analytics and further reporting of your choice including custom reporting and we give you a lot of custom templates of pbi reports also to get you started so that was like my short and quick demo uh there's a set of resources here that i would uh invite you to go and check out you know go to the product web page check out the product documentation and there's a dfp in a day capability that we have where you can get started and get implemented with dfp and get your first kind of report out of dip which actually helps you get value literally within a day and i highly recommend you should try this out it's it's something that really will get you going and from that that point onwards your journey to discovering all the capabilities of dfp will be very easy and so i invite you to uh check that out uh if you can uh with that i think i'll invite uh kevin back in and uh offer some closing remarks super thank you for that so everything you've just been hearing from anand and then myself is all looking to bring together you know a range of those capabilities that we've got on screen at the moment to try and manage the financial risk that then leads through to you know optimizing your overall financial operations so overall i hope you found it very useful and informative about the the various capabilities that we have and then if you could just kind of click a slide a moment for us there's a number of takeaway actions that we have between us you know and i'm looking at it from the lens of the dynamics 365 finance and the hr perspectives if you go to our website there's a host of uh we'll just put in dynamics 365 finance we'll take you to our landing page on the microsoft.com site where you can see a whole range of information where you can drill into a trial experience around finance will start learning and following some learning paths and the same is also true for hr and then would you like to address floor protection yeah i would uh just a quick call out that in fraud protection we have a very interesting capability we offer you even before you sign up for the product we call it roi calculator so please reach out to your account team or your microsoft partner and they can actually walk you through an roi calculator where by giving a few sets of data points like a few attributes about your business you can get a clear quick understanding of how much money basically fraud protection can help you save and make in terms of revenue and so that will be like a real impetus for you to be able to decide whether you want to proceed forward so i highly encourage you taking a look at the roi calculator okay one more click for us please announce as an event there is a number of kind of takeaways we'd like you to address as well you know there is a certification journey that you can start across building your skills and you can go to microsoft learn for microsoft dynamics 365 or from a power platform lens there's a whole community to connect with as well or explore further around the rest of the events so i do hope you get a lot more from the broader event going on and as a final two-part call out from ananda myself initially i'd like to just call out and say thank you for listening to us both today but i'd also like to just kind of draw your attention back to the evaluation surveys and we would love you to fill that detail in and help tune our content that we provide next time around for you so for myself thank you very much thank you you
