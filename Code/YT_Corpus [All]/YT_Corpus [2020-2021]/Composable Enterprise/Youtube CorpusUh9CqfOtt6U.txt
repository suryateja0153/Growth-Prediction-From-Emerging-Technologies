 OK well all things are AI anymore let's be honest right, I mean we have to...we have to understand that we've been training machines to think for us to do to do things for us and we're just at the beginning right? And then we think what in the world is... I mean let's say you've got Alexa you got Google you've got all these different things and when you talk where you got Siri in your iPhone right. All of this are instantiations of A.I.. Now when do you when you look at what else is happening other machine learning, deep learning all these different algorithms and how the entire world is evolving. We're only going to be using them more and more and I think it comes down to the utilization rates and be able to shift resources seamlessly. Right? The user should not have to go there anymore and program certain policies where hey if storage like they should goes above 84 percent you ingest more stuffs. Machines now understand...That's that's the idea. That's the that's the IT nirvana if you will, forward... Being able to have everything automated. So when I look at any type of A.I. workloads is is this seamless reconfiguration of all resources regardless of what vertical and what need you're actually looking at but everything has to be transparent, and and I think as an industry we're putting all of this ecosystem together to make that a reality. But it's still very early. We're definitely one of the foundational pieces as far as where the A.I. as a whole is heading.
