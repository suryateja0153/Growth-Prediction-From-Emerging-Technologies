 I'm Mike Reid and I'm Tony Lewis. And we've been involved in the creation, mixing and production of TV and film music for about the last 20 years. We've been asked by Hewlett Packard Enterprise to score the idea of digital transformation and to create the sound of the HPE Composable Cloud. We've begun this journey with how things shouldn't sound; a chaotic world of overlapping textures with everything fighting for space. And I guess in storytelling terms, this is our musical representation of the challenge that faces IT professionals today with their siloed legacy systems. We understand that this chaotic environment can be really difficult to manage and in a worst-case scenario can easily snowball into catastrophic failure. The process of composing is essentially making sense and structure out of sound. And as we understand it from HPE this is very similar to an IT professional trying to make sense out of their systems and processes. We've deconstructed the cacophony to orchestrate a new sound. A more stable musical fabric. We're scoring the potential of HPE's Composable Cloud. Cloud-based data management is represented by a rhythmic powerful heartbeat. We chose harmonic structure to represent the cloud's core compute. The horn melody in this case represents software automation. Welcome to the HPE Digital Symphony. Finally, we add the human element. This represents how HPE unlocks the potential of a business through its people.
