 good afternoon everyone my name is sharon i will be your host this afternoon just going to go through some quick housekeeping items before we hand it over to our experts welcome to ask the experts digital about digital breakout 135 microsoft dynamics 365 supply chain management for distribution and manufacturing quickly just some notes on how to engage with our experts we see many of you are already typing away in our chat but please do continue to ask your questions via chat we will publish those questions out to all the attendees once they go through our moderation process use the thumbs up icon to let us know that many of you have that same question we will answer those questions both in chat and verbally and we'll also post some resources and links so that you can learn more beyond what we are able to answer during our session some quick notes about etiquette this session will be recorded so you'll be able to go back and reference it later on we ask that you help our moderators please do not spam the chat and be mindful please do not post inappropriate comments lastly we ask that you adhere to the microsoft code of conduct you'll see it is posted in the chat and on your screen at this time as a reminder we are recording the session photography and video on your side of the session is not permitted and with that let me introduce our experts shelley take it away hi everyone i'm shelley bakke coming to you from fargo north dakota and my role is to run all of our customer and partner programs and engagement through our engineering team and with us i have two experts and i'll ask each of them to go ahead and unmute themselves and provide an introduction dana do you want to go ahead and go sure hi everyone i'm dana bork i am a program manager in the supply chain team and i'm working with areas like sales procurement warehouse asset management and iot intelligence great lachlan hi everyone lachlan cash principal program manager work with dana in the supply chain management team specifically focused on order management at the moment but across the application space wonderful well you guys have it you have two experts here that are ready to help answer anything we can with supply chain management related what we'll be doing is asking you guys to go ahead and use the chat feel free to populate any questions we're here to answer as much as we can and provide you with anything that we might not know in the future i believe at the end there will be a link where you can post the question through a survey and so if your question did not get answered please make sure and post it through the survey that way it gives us an opportunity to follow up with you directly so we had a couple questions come in the first question is first of all currently there's limited out-of-box support for mobile applications and the chief management of any company works on their smartphones now actually i think almost all of us are now working on our smartphones it feels like and they usually want to have the information quickly and on hand about their company so for example a request that has been seen lately has been to scan an item barcode and immediately be able to see on hand information so this particular individual has tried many workspaces but performance was slow and since it's a large company it also we didn't look to have either sales order or item on hand information available lachlan or dana are you guys aware if we have anything available on that from a mobile perspective anymore we're looking at the scenario where someone wants to click on an item and or scan the item and see exactly what the inventory levels are so a couple of suggestions there one one if it's if it's more than management of an organization um we certainly have the capabilities of publishing power bi um through mobile applications so you could look at if you're looking at more analytics sort of options you could look at the mobility of power bi and then providing that to um c level execs um we do obviously have direct uh item barcode scanning functionality through obviously the warehouse management app the resource capability through the commerce applications as well given that you've tried the mobile workspaces if it was specifically just a performance issue i'd certainly uh potentially raise a support case um and have a look at it relevant to if it wasn't a production environment i'd raise the support case and have a look at relevant to that one of the other things that you could look at is the capabilities around um power apps there is some basic barcode scanning if it if it is just a basic um item uh scan that you wanted to use just to avoid the data entry of the item number um then you could look at also building it up through power apps as well um i guess that's the specific suggestions that i can add there shall we great thanks lachlan all right dana the next question is for you as it specifically talks about iot intelligence so what is the best way to integrate with iot intelligence we have it our client-side machines with sensors and then it gives the sensor examples there are machines that manufacture caps for wine bottles they need to be able to send real-time temperature and production count feeds and quality checks to the iot intelligent scm per discussions and with the use of any plm providers but is there any way that there can be an integration to the sensor data to azure without using traditional middleware so the the actual scope of the iot intelligence that we have in supply chain management is picking up the signals when they hit the iot hub which is an azure component so the piece this is the the opportunity for partners and it sounds like you may be a partner or working with a customer that's trying to do such an implementation the opportunity is to get the sensor data into the iot hub and there are some other azure iot solutions that may help you to do that so that's one place you may look to if the question is more about the actual formatting of the messages and how the data needs to be formatted to to be received by by uh the iot intelligence that part is um documented on our website so it's on the docs article you have a full um description of how to format the json and how to insert that information so that iot intelligence can pick it up for you so i would take a look at the documentation i think you really have an interesting use case here there's you're looking to bring in real-time temperature and so we do have a quality scenario that maybe you might you may be able to use for that particular one and it looks like that um as it's a quality check that looks like it makes sense for you and then i also saw i think sort of um report as finished where you're wanting to update the production of your items which is um something that we're also working on so yeah so i would take a look at the documentation and as far as how to aggregate the signals within your plant that is a piece that we don't we don't provide that part of the solution so we're providing the connectivity within scm from the iot hub and then into dynamics and handling that integration so you do have some leg work to do to figure out how to get the signals from the sensors to the iot hub and you have lots of options for that so great thanks dana it looks like this next one was more of a comment but maybe i'll ask you guys if we have anything on the horizon for this that you're aware of this individual would like to make sure that we have more places with embedded support for machine learning algorithms do we have any plans on that that you guys have seen or that are currently working on i can maybe jump in there quickly um within the context of dynamics um being is part of the ecosystem with the power platform um there's a few different things that you could look at relevant to the skills within an organization um if you want a low code no code type experience then within power platform we do have the power ai capabilities um there is effort underway in terms of um leveraging that data mechanism of having data from the dynamics applications available that you could consume through power a so that's something that you could look at there if you've got more data scientists within your organization you can certainly use the um the ai studio that's available with the azure tools we have an example of that within the application which is a demand forecasting algorithm so you can certainly follow those patterns if you want to build your own models and then bring data back in in the context of the business application certainly we're looking at um more out of the box scenarios of uh those models where uh where it makes sense for future updates um that's my quick comments on that awesome so i think you probably talked there a little bit too but maybe if there's more that you want to um to extrapolate on about getting ai into dynamics 365 finance and operations particularly supply chain for you guys any recommended architecture or what are the best methods for ai infusion you hit on it a little bit lachlan but i'm just curious if you have any more that maybe you'd want to add to that yeah ultimately that the key is is the platform um and we wanted to make it we want to make it open so that you can leverage obviously the the data lake and and therefore the consumption of data not only just from supply chain maybe other applications that you have within your organization because machine learning is is really data intensive meaning that you need the data for it to train your algorithms and and learn from that point of view um so have a look at what we're doing relevant to data movement to the azure data lake and then that data available to the tools within the microsoft ecosystem uh which is azure machine learning studio and and uh and uh power um ai for for example um so the key the key there is that um you know what algorithm do you need to apply a specific problem to um if it's classification um you know simple classification um a basic time series forecast you have some of those capabilities within power ai if you need to do something a lot more advanced and you've got the skills within organization to do data sciences then the azure machine learning studio is is definitely something to have a look at we obviously make our data available um through the platform um to get that into the data lake um so therefore you could use that within the data lake and the machine learning tools great i want to give a call out to the audience too uh don't forget you guys can use the thumbs up to like a question to get it voted um so that way in case we do start seeing a more influx that we are getting the ones that are of most interest to you guys so with that being said i'm going to jump out of chronological order and go to the next one can you explain where supply chain is most effective for example what are the ideal company size what are the problems we're trying to solve any efficiencies where would you guys say is the sweet spot when it comes to that customer for dynamics 365 supply chain this is a long answer i imagine and could almost take the full time so i am going to time bound you guys on this one um for just a couple minutes sure i i can jump in first um definitely within supply chain management we're focused on those customers within retail uh distribution manufacturing um those customers that are traditionally inventory based but we also do have service capabilities especially when you look at the project functionality where you have projects that need uh inventory in the integration there but primarily in the retail distribution and manufacturing space obviously heavily in inventory based applications so when you look at retail obviously supply chain is the back end of that fulfillment the commerce application has the front end uh when you look at supply chain we obviously have the order coming in uh the inventory management the warehouse management capabilities to fulfill there um so that's really where you're enabling the buy online through the commerce e-commerce capabilities and the ship from the back end because supply chain has the the inventory and warehouse capabilities when you look at distribution companies um similar sort of scenario but often they're getting orders from b2b partners and therefore you you're managing and fulfilling those orders from b2b partners when you look at manufacturing organizations we do cover all modes of manufacturing um predominantly the the mainstreams of being discreet manufacturing process manufacturing and we do have uh integrated lean capabilities as well um obviously when you get into manufacturing there's a lot of different verticals that covers those core modes of manufacturing so we have customers from automotive parts suppliers when we typically talk about discrete manufacturing uh we have companies in um process or food beverage when we talk about uh some of the process industries that can be chemical uh life sciences uh those type of verticals that need process some sort of formula based composition or product or when you have something that's a co-product by-product type process we have customers that use the lean manufacturing incorporated both indiscreet and process where you have moved a specific plant or moved part of the organization to pick up on some of those lean philosophies and you wanted to use a kanban board to drive uh work orders for the manufacturing order or um a inventory movement um with a kanban there for example the lean functionality is actually integrated which is which is a uni capability um but it is integrated to our master planning capability so you can combine the the pull mechanism and the traditional push mechanism that um you normally have with manufacturing um so those key industries of retail distribution manufacturing are obviously our key focus the verticals is obviously where we see a lot of uh customers and and that's obviously where we can talk about a lot of differentiation there but we have the functionality for um you know most of the core verticals that are in that manufacturing um space as well distribution when we talk about distribution of of those uh products um so whether it's you know high-tech um electronics automotive part supply life sciences uh food and beverage um those are a couple of key verticals that we have customers in but we have a lot more um vertical coverage when you look at those different industries um that's probably a short version shelley hopefully there's a question i was going gonna say maybe we should ask for we are not most effective maybe that would be it but i might be biased i don't know thanks lockland i think that was perfect how about um quality management do we have any plans to introduce a quality management app that would integrate with the production module right now this individual is using the capability of quality management or qms but they want to be able to use a quality app anything that we have on the horizon that we're planning for in this space it's a good question um we have had asked for improvement about that functionality um the existing functionality if you're using it does give us basic uh quality order which allows you to track the output of a testing in that you might want to just record that we have done some improvements within warehouse management to improve the ability to route through quality processes so there's some small enhancements related to the warehouse process um to incorporate it with that quality order process um quality associations uh for example um at this stage we don't have a a quality app specifically on the short term roadmap but we have seen that for customers asking for more um integration to the shop floor control and an expanded warehouse functionality um so that's that's probably where we're at our base functionality is really around the process control mechanism of of taking the input related to quality and using that quality order to drive in inventory blocking for example and stuff like that this might be a good time to plug the idea site as well too ideas.dynamics.com is where the community can go and post ideas that you want to see us innovate on and build out as far as capabilities within the product also a great place for you to go and vote on it um just like here we you know your vote and your voice matters and so we definitely are wanting to make sure that we are prioritizing what the community is needing so you'll be able to go out and find all of the applications but in particular supply chain management for sure is out there and again that site was ideas.dynamics.com okay so yesterday this individual saw a demo on the supply chain or in for supply chain management and they saw the sales unit manager they're asking if they can have more information or scenarios for use cases do you guys have anything that you can update on that i'm assuming that's the scale unit yeah i'm not sure if it is um i don't know if we i'm not aware that we had lined up a demo for that [Music] how about we do this we will we'll put pause on that question for right now and if the individual is still out there listening to us on this um please provide a little bit more information as far as what you solve regarding the sales unit manager let's come back to a iot centered question dana so in terms of management are we moving towards an iot centered workforce and if so what would be the cost and pros it's kind of a philosophical question it is yes it's hard for us to get our engineering heads around that one so an iot centered workforce i think so i think it makes a lot of sense for us to to look at all of the industries that that lachlan just mentioned the manufacturing distribution and retail have a lot of opportunities for iot so in retail um imagine today in retail stores that having sensors to tell where there's overcrowding or how many people are in a store or how many people are are in a a part of a store and trying to maintain social distance or if shelves are empty and there's there's a lot of opportunities to to remove costs by adding the iot into the you know into the workforce um same thing with manufacturing and that's the use case that we are directing most closely in the in the iot intelligence solution is looking at the at the factory floor and how do we collect data about production about the health of the machines that are on the floor about the quality of the product that's being produced and how do we quickly and easily aggregate that data and turn it into intelligence that can be used by plant managers and and by plant uh by machine operators and by coos who are who try to make decisions about what to do with their plants and um in distribution we see it as well and around the warehouse trying to keep things safe trying to make sure that that things are in the right place and that people are are in the right places and not in the wrong places not somewhere that's dangerous or is that putting them in a risky situation so all of the information that we can collect today using iot is that there's just a vast amount of information that we can collect that would not be feasible for us to collect by sending people out to to do this type of data collection and it's rich data that we can look at over time and put machine learning on top of it and and train models to to call out exceptions and the the opportunities are endless so i think we've as a society and as a technical organization i think we see the the power that's there and i think companies want to take advantage of that and my i guess philosophical opinion that's where we're going so great answer thank you very much okay so just as a quick time check for everyone we have about five minutes left so if you have other questions feel free to send them our way and let's go back to the question earlier it was referring to our scale unit and that's also a good call out as well too a blog was recently published and the link to that blog is in our chat window which talks about some of the pretty big functionality that we are releasing and announcing with ignite and one of them is our cloud scale unit or what we've referred to in the past as the cloud and edge lachlan do you want to talk about the best scenarios and use cases for cloud and edge sure i can cover that off yeah the the the key there is that um we wanted to give customers the ability where they have some critical workloads specifically in their manufacturing shop floor interaction and within the warehouse um specifically related to you know we know we have customers that use our warehouse they have a truck rolling up we we need to finalize a shipment to get that out and and so essentially the cloud nature gives customers the ability to analyze the network capability of users in terms of where they've got users connecting from um into their uh d365 environment use that to simulate where would be the best place to locate an edge unit um and then coordinate that through the azure technology of standing up an edge capability for taking that workload offline the key is is that we use the edge to enable those critical workloads in manufacturing execution and uh in warehouse um as our initial scenarios um for uh those sort of critical capabilities where they they may not be able to survive with uh internet disconnectivity for example um the the key there is is that it is an edge scenario so the edge scenario augments um the online scenario so um the idea is to work offline while you've got those intermittent connection problems for example so that you can overcome those to keep the keep the staff working or supporting the business where they need critical support from that point of view sounds great we've got two more questions that are in the queue so a reminder for people to add more as the last minutes are ticking down there is also if you think of something later you can use the aka link that is included in the chat too it's aka.ms and then it's the session id which is db135 and we'll be monitoring that to get back to you um so cloud and edge that was definitely one of the announcements another announcement was inventory visibility can you guys either dana lachlan whichever one of you want to talk about inventory visibility and what those use cases are sure we we can uh touch on that um the key capability that we had our customers asking for was um well we had good inventory visibility within dynamics and we use that for um available to promise information through manufacturing for example they wanted to have that information accessible to the external applications in their environment whether that's point of sale whether that's e-commerce systems uh whether that's other external erp applications so what we've done is is provided a new inventory microservice which allows a more optimized inventory model and and therefore provides an api for external applications to be able to call to get an update of that inventory sorry i just needed much up there to cough so go ahead yeah it's just gonna say um so essentially it's a it's an optimized in-memory model um you know for that inventory accessibility so um we've done it both for performance but also the ability to expand that uh query to other apps within the organization yeah okay our last question i think and this looks like a road map question mixed reality and shop floor and assembly line anything out of the box that we're thinking about yeah there's actually um um some capabilities um i think we also included in the announcement for ignite um and we're working on relevant to the integration of our shop floor control and dynamics guides so if you have a look at dynamics guides you can have a look at those capabilities that's quite critical we already have those integration to our asset functionality but leveraging that guide's capability with manufacturing is is something worth enabling as well fantastic and look at that you answered perfectly and on time all right i think that is a wrap for our ask the experts session thank you everyone for participating and asking great questions we really appreciate it we had some questions in our back pocket but we didn't have to use them so thank you for being an active community and having an active session hope you guys enjoy the rest of ignite
