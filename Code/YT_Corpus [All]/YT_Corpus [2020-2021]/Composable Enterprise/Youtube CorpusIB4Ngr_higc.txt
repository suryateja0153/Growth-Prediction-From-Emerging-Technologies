 Funny thing is, I think HPE is the 800 pound gorilla in this term called composability and we find ourselves, you know, a slightly different approach than the way that those guys take it. I think first and foremost, the way that we're different is because we're dis-aggregated, right? When we sell you trays of resources, we'll sell you a tray of SSD or a tray of GPU's whereas when HP takes a converged solution, right? Every time I'm buying resources for my composable rack, I'm paying for CPUs, SSDs, GPUs, all of those devices as a converged resource. So they are converged, we are disaggregated. We are bare metal, we have a PCIe-base fabric up and down the rack, they are an ethernet based fabric. There are no ethernet SSDs. There are no ethernet GPUs, at least today, so by using Ethernet as your fabric, they're forced to do virtualization protocol translation. So they are not truly bare metal. We are bare metal. We view of them more as a virtualized solution. We're an open ecosystem. We're hardware agnostic, right? We allow our customers to use whatever hardware that they're using in their environment today. Once you've kind of gone down that HP route, it's very much a closed environment right.
