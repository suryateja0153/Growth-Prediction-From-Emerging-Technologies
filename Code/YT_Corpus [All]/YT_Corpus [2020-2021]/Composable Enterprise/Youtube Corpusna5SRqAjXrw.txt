 Absolutely. For so first I guess, let me explain a little bit about what we mean by composable infrastructure rather than building servers by plugging devices into the sockets of the motherboard. With composability, it's all about pools or trays of resources. A tray of CPU's, a tray of SSDs a tray of GPUs, a tray of networking devices. Instead of plugging those into a motherboard, we connect those into a fabric switch and then we come in with our software and we orchestrate or we compose at the bare metal, grab this CPU, grab those four SSDs, these eight GPUs and build me a server. Just like you were plugging devices into the motherboard, except you're defining it in software. On the other side, you're getting delivered infrastructure of any size, shape or ratio that you want. Except that infrastructure is dynamic. When we need another GPU in our server, we don't send a guy with a cart to reprogram...to plug device in. We reprogrammed the fabric and add or remove devices as required by the application. We give you all the flexibility that you would get from public cloud on the infrastructure that you are forced to own. And now, to answer your question of where we find a natural fit for our solution, one primary area is obviously cloud. If you're building a cloud environment, whether you're providing cloud as a service or whether you're providing cloud to your internal customers, building a more dynamic agile cloud is what we enable.
