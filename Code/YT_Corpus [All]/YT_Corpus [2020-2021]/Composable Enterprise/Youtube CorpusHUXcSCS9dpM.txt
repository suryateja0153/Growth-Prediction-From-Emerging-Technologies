 thank you and welcome to discover 2019 thank you for coming out to the very first spotlight session here on the very first morning of discover for this year really appreciate you doing that and I'm really looking forward to this conversation as I do usually I know many of you have attended my spotlight sessions now for years and we always have a little bit of fun and and hopefully you find out a few of the things that were pointed at for the future and I know we have a few of those that we're gonna talk about today it's been a really huge year we have a lot going on you probably looked at the the title of this and thought okay preparing for exponential and the next wave of digital business exponential what is probably what you're thinking and we maybe could have put exponential in quotes but we're using this word exponential to kind of do a little thought provoking for you about where we think things are going some people talk about it as exascale other people have said the the fourth Industrial Revolution some people have talked to talked about it as the post cloud era you know there's all these kind of terms going around but we think that there's something actually huge going on in the marketplace so I've been at Hewlett Packard and then Hewlett Packard Enterprise for 32 years I've been on many many programs and and usually on the cutting edge of innovation both in hardware and software you know going back to when we were developing the first scalable x86 system to do the largest HANA installations while my friends were working on blades in Houston we merged those teams together and we went off and and did converge systems and then we built hyper-converged systems we're still doing those today we invented the composable category you know we're growing faster in hyperconvergence than anybody else in the market we invented composable we talked about composable at a discover session just like this and a lot of people are going wow is that really gonna come it's here now and and we're leading that category it's you know over a billion dollar run rate it's headed for two really quickly the fastest-growing value infrastructure play in the history and I get this question a lot hey you guys have been pretty good at kind of using the envelope and and driving the industry what's next and we think we are on to something here that's that's really huge that's next it's around the notion of as a service and you'll hear that as a major future direction not just of the instant industry but actually of the company Hewlett Packard Enterprise and you'll hear about that later today in the CEO keynote so but what's motivating all that why do we think there why is something big coming along so let's dive in and talk about why so there are a few things going on they have to do with exponential that's why we called it preparing for exponential and really the first thing is this explosion in the growth of clouds it's driven at its core by digital transformation everybody in business is talking about how do I transform and and put digital capability into driving my business enabling the profit and revenue stream for my company bringing IT to the forefront as we've talked about in the past but really that digital transformation is really being driven by the development of applications that are built around microservices and more and more those micro services are being built in a hybrid kind of way some on for EM some off ram some for containers bm's cloud native bare-metal all of that it's just there's a whole lot going on this explosion of those specific clouds if you will and the edge is making that even more amazing so with 25 billion devices connected by 2021 what that means is cloud is no longer just gonna mean some collection of servers in some data center somewhere with storage hanging off of it but cloud is actually going to mean these groups of edge clouds all these devices in many clouds that need supported that need updated that need firmware then he managed all of that kind of capability so there's this explosion of clouds that's going on and that is really significant you're gonna need automation you're going to need capability to manage that you're gonna need AI there's no way to kind of grasp all that complexity and be able to simplify it without help without tools without advanced learned kind of techniques to deal with that so explosion of clouds but then there's also just the fundamental explosion of data so today right now we're generating 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every single day and you know you've heard this probably in various places but the amount of data generated in all of our history basically gets doubled every couple of years now so it's just an explosion of data and right now it's kind of a mess frankly we're not making good use of that data we have all these devices we have all this data being generated but we're not analyzing it well we're not storing it well we're not dealing it with it well and we could potentially choke on it honestly all of that data so that's going to take evolution of things like AI and what you're seeing really specifically this year 2019 it seems like we've hit a tipping point of AI and ml where it's no longer that thing that's coming in the future it's actually that thing that is absolutely necessary to deal with where we're at today we're at a tipping point in the explosion of data and being able to utilize that data so it's very important that that AI is one of these things that that can kind of help us but that data isn't just you know at a macro level it's down to our individual selves we've it's estimated that for every single person they're going to generate about 1.7 megabytes of data per second so you're generating that now with your watches and your you know your phone and and basically all the data about you and if you kind of are old like me you'll know that's about the amount of storage that was on a floppy not the old foot not the 360k floppy floppy but the stiff floppy if you will and so that's just a ton of data and so CIOs and and generally the industry's trying to figure out how do we grapple with this what do we do with it how do we manage it and more importantly how do we get insights out of that another thing that is profound about this is there's been a lot of talk in the last you know but maybe three years ago what is all this data going into the cloud well there's so much data and so many devices it can't physically go all in the cloud and it doesn't all belong in the cloud so there's going to be clouds everywhere honestly for edges for centered data centers all of that stuff to deal with this data it's not about where to go it's about how do I bring the cloud to that data and be able to extract insights out of it so we talked about explosion and clouds explosion of data also the explosion of apps and use cases so and I think one of the trends that's gonna help drive that is really around five g so 5g is now coming on the telcos are rolling out I think there's been a lot of talk about ok it's it's a hundred to 250 X faster there's likely this emergence of kind of a merged wired and wireless fabric that that is ubiquitous and is everywhere that's got its own set of challenges in its own set of data but you need to think kind of beyond that and say what does that do if everything is always connected everywhere on the planet the amount of apps and use cases that we see now on our phones it's exploded but it's nothing compared to what it's going to be nothing at all we're just at the tipping point of that stuff so and even if you think about it 5g even has x86 in its specs so even the compute that we're applying to that 5g transition is something that that is just going to hit a knee of a curve and explode so all of these things you can kind of say well the growth in in clouds that you know the number of clouds did growth in the amount of data the growth in the apps and use cases what does that lead to well I would assert to you it's actually exponential growth in complexity what we're gonna have to deal with and I think that you know if you look at the industry we don't know how we're totally gonna deal with that yet but we have some thoughts today that we want to talk about the first problem that we have to overcome though is the human mind really can't think and exponentially it's not wired to think that way and I want to tell you a little story that I know that our R&D teams talked a lot about and and where we're at in this evolution in the industry some of you might have heard this but the story goes it's about the guy who invented chess and legend has it he took the game to the Emperor of the area that is now India and kind of showed him and the Emperor was super impressed he said this chess game is awesome 64 squares all these players can move in different ways and if rolls and things like that is and it's challenging and it's deep and it's complex and he said hey I want to reward you for this in invention and so he said what would you like you name your price and the inventor said you know what he's a sharp guy he invented chess after all so it's probably pretty sharp what I really want is one grain of rice on the first square of the chessboard and then I'd like to double that on every square so two on the second four on the third eight on the fourth and the Emperor thought hey you know that's that's fine that sounds pretty good it's probably worth it for a game like this so after ten squares he was at about a thousand grains of rice that seems not bad ten squares you're already 10 out of 64 at 20 squares here at a million grains which is 35 pounds but you're still 25 here 20 squares starting to look like you know two-thirds of the 1/3 of the chess board and that looks like a lot so it's okay but at 32 squares the first half of the chessboard if you will 4.3 billion grains of rice with this with this doubling that's going on and at that point the Emperor thought ooh maybe this isn't such a good thing so on the second half of the chessboard that's where the exponential nature really takes off you hit any of the curve at 40 squares it's a trillion grains at 50 it's a quadrillion grains is it's a quadrillion grains and at square 64 you're at eighteen point four quintillion grains of rice which is a really big number if you're thinking about it but more importantly it's enough to cover all of India with a metre of rice and so you know that is mind-blowing it's hard to get your head around that but that's not the essence of the story the essence of the story is and futurists talk about the second half of the chessboard they're referring to this example which is basically when you hit that knee of the curb it just kind of explodes and you can't really deal with that I would assert to you I believe that's where we're at in the industry right now I believe that you know you might say well cloud it changed everything I think cloud is how we're dealing with just the first phase of the second half of the this explosion of data these ubiquitous applications the explosions of apps the amount of pressure on IT organizations to hit time to market and to deal with the complexity that they're dealing with we're not gonna care about okay which cloud am i preferring or that we're gonna basically be using everything we have to deal with this explosion of data and I think that's really huge so the point of today's conversation is okay if we're trying to think exponentially how do we deal with that explosion and I'll assert to you there's some things we have to do right now we have to kind of change our way of thinking first of all for those of you which many of you are you're basically now in IT infrastructure and cloud provisioning and app development things like that you're gonna have to become a service provider period service provider to the business and that means you're gonna need to be able to know how to broker services to the lines of business that they need you're going to be able to need to be able to instantly provision capabilities and so in order to be do that it's gonna it's gonna have to require you to have some things that you're changing about what's going on in your environment and so instead of thinking about well should this go in the cloud or should this go not go in the cloud you should be thinking about I have so much data it's gonna be everywhere I need to be able to bring that cloud to the data the experience has got to be the cloud experience regardless if this data needs to stay on pram or whether it's in the cloud I'm gonna use all those tools and all that capability to my advantage because I have to in order to deal with this exponential reality second thing is as you have on Prem infrastructure or even in Colo infrastructure or even infrastructure that you have to maintain that's out of your your historical capability for your databases things like that you need to be able to treat that infrastructure as code there's no way to physically be able to have enough people to go out and serve us all that's going to be needed for this explosion of data apps another gonna have to be able to treat it as code you're gonna have to be able to automate it and quite frankly you're gonna have to be able to apply tools like AI ops to kind of manage that infrastructure for you but the other thing is if you think of an explosion of data and apps all of that you're not going to be able to pick a cloud you're not gonna be able to pick a stack you're not gonna be able to pick a vendor unfortunately we'd love it if you'd pick hpe only but we're actually wise enough to say not going to work too much complexity too much going on you're gonna have to have choice and in order to have choice you're gonna have to break silos you can't be locked into well this is my stack it works really well for some things it doesn't work well for these other things that's not gonna work when you're having an explosion an exponential explosion of things that you need to go do and finally not only do you have to be a service provider but everything you have to do have have to accomplish needs to be delivered as a service and everything you consume needs to be delivered to you as a service why so that it can scale so that you can turn it off and on so that as we hit the higher parts of the curve you're immediately ready to hit those higher parts of the curve so that you can afford it so that the cost is appropriate for what the value that you're extracting out of it so these four things they're gonna be more and more important to be able to deal with this exponential reality that we're talking about so I want to talk a little bit about each of those and give you some examples in HPE not product pitches but really examples of what capabilities are we bringing to kind of help you in this battle to conquer exponential or embrace exponential and be ready for it so this first thing you saw some of you kind of scratch your heads like bringing the cloud to the data what exactly do you mean well what I mean by that is if you agree with me that there's too much data to put in one spot and it's everywhere and it's ubiquitous well then what really matters is bringing a capability bringing the tools bringing the workload bringing the applications to where that data specifically is and the only way to be able to do that if you're really trying to make that in a way that you can manage huge complexity is if the experience is consistent so it's really about consistency of experience the cloud experience whether it's on pram whether it's in a Colo whether it's off pram whether it's in one specific public cloud the experience needs to be the same across those and it needs to look like and as a service kind of delivery model the second thing it's got to be fast it's gotta be speedy you're dealing with an explosion of data you can't be saying well now I'm gonna manage this thing like a project and the project means I go procure infrastructure and then I wait around for it to show up then I install software and then I wait around for that to be qualified and then I try it out with it beta and of this and I not gonna work it's got to be as a service got to be instantly provision whether it's on or off Prem so there's got to be speed and really that is gonna be those those two characteristics that consistency of experience and the speed are gonna really fundamentally change what it is that you guys do as roles and what we need to deliver as a company and it is fundamentally changing our strategy so a few of the things that we're providing in the the capability there well certainly if you've been at these sessions before you've heard me talk about composable infrastructure being able to compose infrastructure and apps across your data center is super critical it really is the thing that allows you to automate and do things instantly but it's not just about integrated hardware software packages it's also being able to live in a hybrid cloud environment and automate the things that are appropriate to to make it work to make it sing if you will and one of those things to automate is the compliance and controls it's something everybody has to deal with no matter what workloads they're running in a hybrid manner so that's critical but then the other thing that I mentioned earlier is really you're gonna have to get to where you're using AI ops not just AI applied to data insights but AI to manage all of the complexity of the clouds the data and the apps and that's critical and I'll tell you how we're headed in that direction so nearly every technology in the data center is transformed with you know servers and storage and all that other kind of stuff except networking it really hasn't transformed you get networking transformation if you go into a public cloud because behind the scenes they've set up a scalable network that has good rack to rack bandwidth but on Prem hasn't been that way so what we introduced this last year something called composable cloud which really kind of helps with that problem in the past you've kind of needed a PhD to be able to solve the networking problem on Prem because traditional leaf spying networks that were set up to run stacks of databases and things like that that didn't talk that much across racks they were difficult to set up they were difficult to optimize and generally what you found is ok well I need to make sure that my application runs in this exact track right here because if I spread it across these racks the performance goes terrible that can't be in a cloud if you're sharing infrastructure you know Gartner talks about these traits of of what cloud native infrastructure needs to have and it really is around elasticity and modularity and and being able to be persistent and being able to be resilient you really need something that looks like a cloud but it's in your data center so it's gotta be modular like our composable cloud it's gotta be resilient it's gotta have those capabilities around persistence so if something fails if a node fails the network automatically Maps it out and it's got to be elastic meaning as you scale it it's invisible traditional leaf and spine doesn't work that way so we bought plexi and we added it to our portfolio and what it does is gives us a flat composable fabric that's under one management domain under our HPE one view the engine of composability and allows you to do on Prem infrastructure that looks exactly like a public cloud in fact it has all those characteristics that you run cloud native infrastructure on so that's a really important step and a lot of customers are extremely interested in that a lot of customers are already using that composable value proposition today in our synergy systems now we have it available on our rack servers with our composable fabric solution in one view the thing that's new here at discover that we're announcing is when we introduce composable cloud we kind of said alright it so we're gonna make it a lot like synergy and we'll ship to the customer in a three rack config or a very fixed config it has all the stuff integrated and you take it but the customers were saying well wait a minute that's not dynamic that doesn't allow me to grow from where I'm at what I'd really like to do is take this rack of reliance that I already have and I'd like to turn that into composable infrastructure and so here at discover we're announcing that we now enable you to do that you add composable fabric you add composer technology which is really our pe1 view and you can upgrade to composable cloud so that's just one example of us making it easier to make a consistent experience between on pram and off prem and we offer that in both of our composable platforms cloud and synergy so i mentioned infrastructure is one kind of element but there's a whole element of compliance across your hybrid estate not just your public cloud but also your private cloud even if it was built on composable cloud and being able to automate that to this point you know we have guys that came to us as part of the acquisition of CTP that that made it really obvious to us that ok part of the thing customers are struggling with really heavily is compliance I got these 1,500 lists of rules and everything every time something changes in just their public cloud environment they got to go back through those rules make their sure everything's compliant what if we automated that and made it so that not just you're off Prem assets but also your on-prem could be verified as compliant on an ongoing basis so what we've created is this continuous compliance service what it is is real time monitoring and alerting of control failures and recommendations for remediation and it has the most up-to-date policies and and all of the things that you need whether it's HIPAA or GDP are all of those things and as they change we continuously synchronize the service so it automatically updates and helps make sure that you're still maintaining compliance definitely helps with audit preparation that's a key value that customers love in it and really we're bringing our expertise that we've brought into teams about public cloud migrations and dealing with hybrid estates and we fill that in to this compliance checking tool so it's another example of making things easier to exist in a hybrid cloud environment and the final one I said I'd talk about for an example is really around AI ops and many of you know that with our acquisition of nimble we got something called info site I would assert to you that info site is probably as much or more value than the flash memory kind of capability that we got with nimble and the reason is because they doing a great job of using machine learning to remediate failures inside nimble arrays we've now taken that technology and spread it across our Palance it's headed to synergy we're announcing here a discover that we now have it on simplicity and we're building on that technology in its infancy what it really was was about being able to remediate errors predict when you know a atoms gonna fail or a piece of flash memories gonna fail now we're moving beyond that so the way it works is it has advanced pattern recognition six hundred trillion sensor data points globally under info site management at this point and with all that data we can infer here are things that are gonna happen to a set of infrastructure and and be able to predict and figure out failures before they happen so we announced here at discover or announcing here discover that it's available for simplicity and certainly it's going to help with simplicity remediating potential failures and and things that may occur but more importantly and this is the huge harbinger of things to come and how we're gonna use this AI ops is we're already using it with simplicity to optimize performance that means don't just look at pieces that can fail look at this configuration how's it performing how does it perform versus other configurations that we have under info sight how does it perform versus competitor prod or competitors to this industry anonymously we can look at the big pool and say hey you know what if you tweak this if you add it a little bit more memory you double your performance you should probably do that so we're at the point with simplicity where now we can make recommendations on here's how you can improve your performance in our simplicity just by using info sight and AI ops if you play this out a little bit you say oh well you can oh and by the way that's using VMware integrated into simplicity not even the company that owns VMware can do that kind of predictive here's here's ML applied to the performance to improve your your performance and capabilities so we're really excited about that it's a very big competitive differentiator but if you play this out imagine where this goes pretty soon we can give customers advice we can offer as a service here's your current stack here's how its running you could save money if you move this piece here move that piece there and in fact we can do that at an advice but imagine at some point we can just do it in and execute you basically say look I want an automatic optimization enabled as a service we flip it on and those machine learning insights in the AI Ops environment make the choices for you and broker the things to the different places they need to go so that's that is how you start to deal with exponential and we're moving very fast down that road right now with products that we're already shipping so pretty excited about that so that was kind of the area of how do you you know where are some things that are gonna help bring the cloud to your data the next thing is really around enabling infrastructure is code and this is really just about our platforms integrated software we've had this religion about make this stuff easy to use and make it have an API so that you can just immediately deploy and have things behave like a cloud and so we have an industry-leading hybrid cloud portfolio that has those capabilities and today I'm just gonna give you kind of a smattering of what's new on each of these so we talked about simplicity and how we now have info site in integration into that also new with simplicity as we've introduced our HPE simplicity 325 it's a 1u density optimized and cost optimized because it has the AMD epic processor on it really a density cost play in the simplicity space so so watch for that you'll see the the press release here also we've added a simplicity 380 storage optimized nodes so it actually has you know it on our simplicity we've previously just shipped flash based systems now we're offering flash plus hard disk drive this thing's really fantastic for federated simplicity systems where you want to do aggregation and backup on to a more central node with a very large hard drive on it cost optimized super simple fastest backup and recovery in the industry with dedupe and compression enabled full performance fantastic offerings so so that's simplicity in their synergy continuing to grow and I mentioned earlier simplicity growing at about 2x the market rate it is the number one fastest-growing hyper-converged platform in the industry so we're really proud of that synergy the number one growing value platform whether it's hyper convergence or anything synergies growing faster than anything else quickly on a pace to head towards 2 billion in annual eyes DREV anew and lots of action 3200 customers now we have on synergy and we're you know pedal-to-the-metal continuing this is our first infrastructure as code platform that we delivered change the industry we always joke around that all hyper-converged wants to grow up to be composable someday and I'll talk about how simple it ease on a path to do exactly that in fact we're already there but with synergy now upgrading in terms of bandwidth is coming to it upgrading management process bandwidth updating the scale so you're able to do extremely competitive cloud installations private cloud installations based on synergy and it's really changed the industry the one in the middle is this new composable cloud thing that I talked about at the beginning and what's kind of cool there is what we introduced what we're introducing it discover is now we have simplicity included in the composable cloud so that hyper-converged solution now can be consumed as part of our composable cloud which means you can get the integrated cloud software with it you get integrated one view with it one view being the engine of composability one sphere being the engine of as a service or cloud capability inside that platform so pretty proud of those upgrades and then I also mentioned composable cloud how we're now offering in-place upgrades to your po Lions as they exist so that's the in first infrastructure is code section and I thought be good to pause here and speak to a customer a really important customer both to me business-wise and personally because I'm just an addict of re I I'm a I live in Colorado a fairly avid mountain biker when I'm not traveling on planes for work and things like that as well as I like to ski and I like to snowboard and I like to wakeboard and I have a lot of things that I really like to do and I hope to do more of someday but anyway that aside David here to talk about how they're using this infrastructures code and the the platforms that we have particularly simplicity and want to invite him up and talk to him a little bit about his experience so David come on out thank you great come on over all right all right Academy yeah so first and more important than all this infrastructure stuff I heard you're getting into mountain biking yeah so I have an REI co-op mountain bike it's a fantastic bike it's our branded bikes and take the kids out biking and mountain biking through trails near my house on Father's Day I just went paddleboarding with the battle board I bought it re awesome so often yeah well good thanks alright well don't everybody go on your app right now to order your arms yeah yeah exactly but I'm an addict I use it all the time so what now let's talk about infrastructure a little bit what specific problem were we trying to solve when you guys looked into simplicity yeah so a little bit about REI we have 155 source and 18 million co-op members I know you're one of our co-op members thank you for that and within our stores we had seven eight year old hardware and it was really distributed and it's you know just the way it was configured and really a lot of heterogeneous you know deployments right across those stores and so we really needed to level up we really need to get current and we had a lot of different vendors that we had between storage and compute and backup solutions so we spoke to our account team at HP teri and we had a great conversation about the potential for simplicity to help us with our needs and and really the the needs were that again we we need to have homogeny across all of our stores yeah we need to have the ability to grow different lines of business across our stores and then also have the ability to have backup and restores within seconds yeah so let's talk a little bit about that backup and restores what kind of benefits are you seeing to your stores now now that you have simplicity and yeah you know we we have a major store in our Seattle area our flagship store and we've been just yeah it's a great store there's a climbing wall that goes two stories up in the front of the store it's fantastic place and we just a couple weeks before we launched a rental program I'll talk about that in a minute we we installed simplicity we saw huge performance games yeah and that allowed us to launch our new rentals program that allows folks to try before you buy rent backpacking gear rent paddle boards yeah rent kayaks and that line of business was super helpful and needed simplicity to get us there yeah would you say you're delivering recreational equipment has the service absolutely we're a service provider for outdoor audible mute so you'll rent it actually to customers for a whatever duration they want and then they return it and yeah and our hope is you know they tried enough then they're invested in the products and they buy it very cool very cool where do you see all of this going you know with the the capability that we're providing what what are your future challenges and you know how do you see as helping you in that yeah with simplicity an interesting data point you know the infrastructures code area or our team is layered on things like ansible play books for our hardening and installation practices so we've been able to really leverage some of the simply platform to really differentiate on where we're going is a systems engineering team yeah and to really codify our you know our approach to that additionally you know the DISA continued growth in our stores simplicity is going to help with the different lines of business for bringing it in finally you know that the backup and restore super important for business continuity our brick and mortars just as our online store are super critical so having availability enough time and the ability to recover within seconds certainly was helpful yeah so you're you're making great use of hyper-converged infrastructure and infrastructure as code any interested any interest in composable yeah so we're actually doing an active POC with synergy yeah and that's going fantastic we've been leveraging the image streamer we have a new data center that we'll be opening up and we're excited for the potential for that that coupled with our continuous delivery tooling that we're going to be rolling on internally to help our development team being able to deploy containers yeah and VMs within a synergy framework it's going to be important for us yeah so maybe just parting thoughts and your thoughts on this notion of exponential do you feel like we're at the knee of occur I mean where where do you think we're at in the industry do you feel something big on the horizon is there's so much as an engineer you need to know and it goes into the traditional data center space as a systems engineer you need to start thinking like a software engineer yeah you need to start posting things and get issuing pull requests or having pull requests issued for your code there's there's a different way of thinking and then also just so much to take in and you know partnering with HP we we partner with CDW as well and our installation those are the partnerships that we really value to help us augment you know where we need it and then have our engineering teams be able to take in what they cared for you know just that growth that's happening we we have tooling and pipelines to consider we've got infrastructure in the data center infrastructure in our stores these are changing so quickly yeah but again partnerships matter and we're really pleased our partnership with HP great well thank you so much for being a customer and a partner and thanks for all the great equipment thank you so much yeah take care all right so we talked a little bit about infrastructure as code and and the journey of REI now I want to talk a little bit you know kind of do our our third pillar of the four I mentioned at the beginning which is really around breaking silos so if you believe exponential growth of apps and data and clouds you're not going to be able to one tool is not going to solve all of your challenges one cloud is not going to solve all of your challenges you're gonna have different things that you want to do use for different reasons and really in this area some examples I wanted to bring up are really around optimal placement of your data and apps if there's this plethora of choices and there's all this stuff to kind of have to place you're gonna need advice on where should things go and where should they live you're also going to want really deep integration with a set of partners but that set of partners you're gonna want a bunch of flexibility of choice to kind of get after so let's talk just a little bit about some of this stuff so the first one if you think about the complexity associated with where do I put my work Lode where do I run it we did some analysis on okay as workload count goes up so if you have 50 workloads and you're trying to figure out okay what hardware do I put them on and how complicated is this choice can I just have some guys sitting in the room and kind of figure out oh this should go here that should go there really at 50 workloads you have about three hundred thirty million correlated points like you know is the infrastructure over utilized what's the storage needs what's the complexities it's already kind of beyond what you can really think about it two hundred fifty workloads which is you know a mid-level enterprise certainly has 250 workloads you're talking about a trillion correlated points and at 1,500 workloads like some of our big enterprise customers you're talking about seven Petta correlated points which is just mind-boggling and you can't deal with its kind of back to the exponential motion so we offer this capability called right mix advisor we're making it available now through our as a service that I'll talk about in a little bit and allows you to figure out okay where should my apps and data live for a given application and the really cool thing about it is it's a it's a Discoverer assess plan it kind of sniffs through and says these are the workloads let's assess where this should be and builds a plan but in that plan it tells you here's the low-hanging fruit here's what you ought to do today this is obvious here's what you ought to be working on a plan to do here's the stuff without a whole lot of data gravity and so it can be moved willy-nilly you can move it back and forth depending on where the cheapest infrastructure is to run on it or the best performance whatever your criteria is so if you think about much like I said around AI ops if you think about how right mix advisor plays out over the over the future pretty soon it won't be advisor it'll be right mix executor it'll actually kind of say look the right mix based on all the parameters and the economic models of what's cheapest today and what's fastest today says these workloads should be in these positions and we're working to evolve that to be able to just make it execute and do that on the fly so another way of dealing with exponential we talked about this notion of choice and I think if you really kind of get to the core of what's making HPE unique in this space and dealing with exponential and dealing with hybrid cloud it's really the fact that we're not a vendor and in fact I think almost all of the vendors that compete with us in our space are saying buy my stack everything will be great live in my cloud everything will be great do this everything will be great Google is a notable exception we're going to talk about that in a second but a lot of people are kind of you know my way or the highway on this whole notion and what we've hear from customers is that isn't gonna work and for those of you who've been working with us on composable infrastructure you know that from the very outset we made composable infrastructure to have a simple API to it and we had a broad ecosystem of partners that had adapted to that API and it even included a bunch of competitors that we didn't care that's fine customers need to use this composable infrastructure it's fine we think it'll stand on its own we want it to work in a broad ecosystem of partnerships so that's what's on the right here but as we're evolving this whole Green Lake and as a service business we're taking that notion and we're going even further there are areas that we haven't done deep integration with one view because we still have some value add in our composable kind of platforms but if a customer says well I I want something that's really from a competitor and I want the experience and I want it delivered as a service with Green Lake basically if they want it we're going and doing it so even competitive situations that in the past we've kind of shied away from like a big announcement that we had here with Nutanix in the last six months we offer that as a service under our Green Lake now so you know doesn't matter to us that it competes with some of the things that we have what matters to us is if you're gonna be the vendor who's trusted to advise people on where things should live and what they should use then you're gonna also have to be willing to kind of say if their choice is I want to use X and I want to consume that as a service if it's everything as a service then we're gonna help them consume that as a service and so that's a strategic direction a huge choice that we've made and it's very different than basically all of the other competitors and in fact as evidence to that we announced maybe it's been a couple months ago kind of our new partnership with Google anthos to do containers on pram and that kind of ability well here at discover we're expanding that announcement and I want to bring up Jennifer Lin a product manager director at Google to talk a little bit about what we're announcing identify come on over all right Jennifer so we've been working out this partnership and kind of figuring out how things should work and for those of you don't know what we're basically doing at a high level the high level summary is we're expanding the partnership to be able to do hybrid as a service in a partnership with Google both for data that needs to move data and applications that need to move on and off prem from google cloud to an on-prem environment so it's pretty groundbreaking in terms of what's going on in the industry but let's kind of take a step back and talk first about what's anthos what's the benefit what's kind of and maybe even what's your role talk about how you're involved in that whole thing and then tell us about anthos sure so I lead product team in Google cloud platform we're very focused on sort of our new hybrid cloud solution with anthos I'll talk a little bit more about that also leave the teams around security and privacy as well as how we do billing for our services in the marketplace with a partner ecosystem so this notion of sort of self provision services is sort of core to a lot of the things that we're doing anthos we is our rebranding of what we previously called our cloud services platform and we really do think that it's a different take on sort of a stack and OpenStack for cloud moving forward we just announced general availability of our Antho solution we're pleased to partner with HP because we very much believe that this new sort of open framework very much based in in kubernetes and how we manage our micro services is something that over the last 15 years or so Google's really built an environment to accelerate developer efficiency and with the sort of new pace of data and new applications and distributed applications that essentially need to be location agnostic cloud agnostic we really believe that this sets a different tone for how hybrid cloud can be delivered that managed you mentioned the word open in there tell me just a little bit about I mean it's pretty special the way Google is so open with the platform and the capabilities so we built our own container orchestration platform back in 2004 that we call Borg and in 2014 a decade later we open-source that to the community under the open source project kubernetes and for the last five years now it just hit its 50-year anniversary we've probably seen more change in the software industry around sort of this shift to container orchestration how we can manage these systems at scale and allow really workload portability so the fact that containers are portable and that we can manage these things at global scale independent of the environment that it runs is the thing that gets us to the multi cloud future and for you know as you talked about Rick we are very aware that most of our enterprise customers more than eighty percent of the data is on Prem so this notion of sort of bringing the edge of the cloud to our customers and allowing them to modernize in place at their own pace is sort of core to what we believe is different about Anthes I think we love that as well I think the other thing that was really cool about the partnership we're working on with you is sometimes you get the feeling the objective is just get everything in the cloud I think for for Google there's a healthy perspective of it's not all going to the cloud it will be a hybrid environment maybe say a little bit about that how you see the market developing yeah for us the top priority is agility and efficiency so this notion of sort of a platform for application modernization is the way that we think about anthos and you know the mix for every customer is going to be different in terms of how much runs in print on Prem or in the cloud or in most of our customers are already going down the path of a multi cloud strategy but they want to not have to retrain you know their employees their engineers their IT administrators etc with every decision that they make so they developers very much want to write once and run anywhere that's the promise of containers and that's why in the last two years you know the most activity has happened in the history of software around this area it's happening superfast I think with that then since 90% of new applications are already containerized out the gate then essentially you need investment protection around a operational paradigm where essentially you can manage those things at scale so a lot of it is how do you do lifecycle management for these micro services how do you also make sure it embraces the existing environment you can get better telemetry better cost governance for your existing environment but you can get a lot more deep you know application layer statistics and empower the developers when you write it that way so I think we're seeing that full spectrum there's no doubt you know I spent time with customers and the momentum on kubernetes is undeniable you know and it was only three years ago or so that people were still kind of saying you know how am I going to orchestrate containers and what's kind of the lead and all of that that seems to have consolidator I'm sure you guys see that everywhere so yeah I think this you know we're just at the beginning of this I think while you know for us we launched four billion containers a week in our Google environment so for William we've we've sort of financial operational domain experience but I think the challenge moving forward since we're just at the beginning of this is how do we hide the complexity as not everyone should have to know how to manage that global scale four billion containers oh yeah yeah definitely an example of exponential so your thoughts on where all this goes what's the future you know as we're talking about how's the industry changing what do you think the future is well I mean we're really excited about working directly and partnering with customers by the way I'm a co-op member of REI as well three boys love it so you know customers like our retail customers and financial services highly regulated customers they have a lot of the governance you know concerns around PCI compliance and you know making sure that they can pass their audits but at the same time they want to innovate they want to move their business forward they want to think about ROI not just TCO so we're really taking this partnering approach both with our customers and our partner ecosystem we you know while Google is a very large company we have no illusions that it's going to be one vendor that does it all so how do we build essentially this open framework which is both about the software architecture but also about sort of this model that we could collaborate in the ecosystem and that's why open source has been very important to us you know we've open sourced a lot of the innovations that we've done to try and get the industry rallied behind it open source is just really an accelerator I think when we deliver sort of managed solutions to our customers so that they can essentially unlock the power of their data or grow their business that's what's exciting yeah thank you so much for the partnership Jennifer and thank you for being here to talk about it thank you all right so choice is absolutely critical and these partnerships are critical so where do I think all of this stuff goes and I mentioned at the beginning a pretty significant evolution of HPE and what we're focused on and I think you're gonna hear about this a little bit later in in the CEO keynote delivering everything as a service you need to be able to do that to your internal customers as an internal service provider and we need to be able to enable you to do that so we got to talk about ok what does this mean I mean if this is a big deal and a where does it go so this whole as-a-service vision if you will is about bringing the cloud to your data center and edges bringing this experience and and it has some key tenants that I really want to talk about a little bit but before we get there I want to motivate the topic a little bit so you might say well as a service that's probably something that's on the rise or or maybe that since public cloud is kind of consumed in that way maybe that's you know that's what as a service really is well we did a little homework with IDC to kind of look at ok what's the status of infrastructure today in this bottom part the 71 billion is where kind of the traditional players have been doing their thing and even hyper-converged infrastructure and all of those kind of infrastructure places a 71 billion and something really important is happening this year and that is infrastructure as a service plus platform as a service or the true as a service market if you will which is evolving into workload as a service which is evolving into outcomes as a service all of that stuff is surpassing the basic infrastructure market that is you know we talked about the second half of the chessboard this should pop you're right in the head and say this is the knee this is the knee of the curve this means that going forward it won't be long when we're talking about as a service is what everybody's doing and then there's the exception which is but not as a service part of the market and it'll be talked about differently so remember that you know a couple years I think I'll think oh that's right that guy he sounded like a wacko but that was the knee of the curve that's exactly where we're at so this is super important and you kind of have to then say well is it just the cloud experience is just pay-as-you-go what is it well let's talk a little bit about that what are that what are the pieces and we've worked hard to identify okay at its core what is as a service about and the one in the middle is the one that we're already doing at a huge rate it's really pay for what you use and that for us is now almost a three billion dollar business inside of HPE it has to do with changing to an optics model infrastructure that we deliver but this as a service vision is not just about switching topics or doing a lease model or that kind of thing I think some of the competitors are thinking that's where it is that's not all of what it is that's a little tiny piece that's how you pay for it and and and being able to pay in a dynamic way but there's more to this than that and it's really about self-service being able to have the tools to immediately procure deploy applications to create a hybrid cloud environment to create a hybrid cloud application that's just ready to run in a hybrid environment and do that in a way that's point-and-click and super simple it's a marketplace just like you're experienced with on your phone and those kind of capabilities that revolution in your personal device kind of arena has not really happened in enterprises and it's coming and it's coming really quickly and we're gonna be one of the drivers of that revolution but the other piece of this is it can be operated for you and you might say well wait a minute is that mean you're gonna operate all of our data centers and every piece of infrastructure no not all of them but you're gonna want us to do more and more of that over time you're gonna want us to take away kind of the basic tasks of having things up having firm or a run we do that some with tools but we also do that with some manpower associated over time the balance has to be more and more tools and over time the balance is you're just gonna want to consume that you're not gonna want to have to do that all yourself that'll take a while to play out but mark my words that's kind of where the industry is is heading and we see that as a huge opportunity for HPE to help so let's break each of these apart and talk about okay what's the old model you know in this specific area so self-service last year we announced this Green Lake hybrid cloud thing and really our cloud management solution brings together this rich set of cloud management services all delivered as a service we have customers that are consuming hybrid cloud as a service they pay either by the VM or they pay by the number of users they do they have on a given system or they pay by backup as a service I have this much to back up it's really focused more on the outcome the thing that they're consuming rather than how much infrastructure or what are the detail how fast is they're running or what's the size and that kind of capability so central that whole experience is already self-service and in fact you know we've been shipping HPE ones fair we announced that it discover we've been talking about that one view has become the engine of composability think of one sphere as the engine of as a service it really is the thing behind the scenes that provides the self-service portal that we're now delivering to customers in order to vend as a service capability so the old way things were done in in this whole self-service arena where well I need to figure out how much hardware I need I need to go do some forecasting I need to purchase that wait around for it to show up and then the resources show up today it's point-and-click I need this service I need this VM I need this bare-metal I need whatever it is I need I need this much backup point-and-click and make it happen not just in a public cloud but across my pram and I think some of you might be thinking oh as a service that means public cloud no it turns out we just spent a half hour talking about how the fact that applications and data are gonna live in a hybrid environment but nobody's doing as a service for that hybrid environment as a service is right now mostly in a public cloud HPE is plowing the trail to deliver as a service in that hybrid environment on pram off pram Colo all of it it's a bold new direction for where we're driving aggressively and delivered through a simple portal so the one that we have already been developing our business and I mentioned it's a big business for us now 2.8 billion dollars of total contract value over 600 customers which is really about paying for things in a different way paying for what they actually use the old way was try to guess at how much infrastructure you're gonna need then over provision because you'll guess wrong and don't want the business to be stuck most of my customers like when I was working closely with a ton of the blade's customers and synergy over-provision at seventy to a hundred percent that's a whole lot of infrastructure sitting around not doing a whole lot for Christmas time until Christmas comes or whatever the peak time is now it's really getting more and more for both off Prem and on Prem about pay for exactly what you use and have the as a service delivery partner take on the risk of what you're not using how do you take on that risk well one of the things we do is make it cloud like so that you're sharing that capacity that's why things like synergy share the capacity underneath you have to be able to to flex those resources and provide that scaling as a native kind of operation so that's what the new as a service world kind of requires but there's another tenant here that really is about operating it for you and you say well you know how aggressive are you guys about this well you know right now we look at the IT market and IT is spending about 80 percent of its budget just keeping its lights on and that's held pretty steady fact it's gotten a little bit worse in the last 10 years we used to say 70 percent and really now what you're finding is that service provider role of IT in most enterprises needs to be focused not on keeping the lights on and keeping the infrastructure up and running and all that other stuff it needs to move higher in the stack to say where are we going what are the new applications and workloads what are the new partnerships that we need to enable through a partner like HPE because they enable choice what are the partners how do we get kubernetes into our environment all that that's where you need to be focused and you need help focused on the update my firmware keep this thing running you know kind of getting out of the the blocking and tackling kind of thing and we believe that hybrid delivery of that kind of capability the operations is a next big wave for us and we're providing that capability through the same set of self-service portal through the same kind of green light capability that that we're delivering so these pretty much are going to rock the industry and I know that sounds pretty bold but that's a fundamental tectonic shift there's a whole lot of infrastructure still left to deliver and support and make Software Defined in all of that but it's a bold new direction and where we go if you look at it you know what you're really trying to do is be a service provider to deliver these applications CRM ERP EHR and all that you've got all these choices where should I go what should I do all that kind of capability what you really want is a self-service portal that says I want this capability online kubernetes with Google to be able to deploy this application or I want a VM or I want bare metal kind of an infrastructure as a service kind of thing or I want to be able to do this much backup or I wanted this integrated healthcare solution and I want to pay this much a month for it so what our goal is to really unify all these services and solutions have a common way to interact make it automated make it consistent and make it deliverable but not do it in a custom you have to buy everything from HPE way it's a it's a wrapper a portal an enabler of these services the hybrid services across a flexible vendor environment that's what we're really trying to deliver and to kind of bring that home what I asked the team to do is hey give me kind of a concept car a kind of a concept around what it is we're delivering and let's talk about you know maybe you do bare metal as a service kind of capability and let's jazz it up make it look a little more Vegas II and I think they did that and then some and then they took some personal data about things maybe even rock bands that I've liked in my past or something like that and they did kind of a couple little vignettes that show you kind of how we're thinking about this delivery of as a service so what this is is the Green Lake marketplace of the future and you'll have in this services such as continuous compliance which we talked about earlier that's automated you select it out of there it's this marketplace is the unifying experience you get on to hp.com you go to the portal you click and you say this is the set of services that I'm kind of interested in you say okay I want to make bare-metal available to my internal customers so you and I tu say I want to install that app you pick that bear lap it installs it you're kind of looking like oh is this just all fake well we're a little closer and I'll talk about that to this being real it's probably not quite as rock on but but we definitely have the marketplace implemented and we have customers looking at that so that kind of tells you the experience of okay I go out and I've selected services and you can see kind of a menu of these services here continuous compliance HPE portal are composable fabric you can turn that off and on since now we do it in a flexible kind of way so you pick the services and you you enable your internal customers to just consume those services and all comes as part of your HPE bill but they went one step further and said okay what would kind of a creative example of if we did an HPE metal service and I think they got stuck on the metal theme when they went to do that but I thought it would be worth showing you guys kind of the thoughts so we're we've traditionally been a super-strong hardware vendor kind of player and obviously if we're gonna pick a service bare metal as a service would be something really interesting to customers so they took a shot at okay if we did bare metals as a service here's what it was specifically would look at look like so here we have a service that allows you to quickly and easily deploy bare metal services while leaving the details of managing firmware and all that to somebody else basically us and you'll be able to deploy and then deploy resources as well as keep an eye on utilization and cost and you can kind of see it'll go through here and talk about okay what's our bare metal server going to be called okay well this one has a specific name given Rockstar but I want to add another one so I'll add another one in here and basically make it super simple super cool for your consumers to kind of go in and go I'm just gonna add more bare metal instances so something extremely powerful you might look at this and say so this is all just fake you guys are making this up well it turns out through green like hybrid cloud we have this environment we have this marketplace we have it available now but we're offering our first major VMs as a service here by the end of the summer so you'll be able to consume VMs service from HPE through pre provisioned hardware either on your Prem or in a Colo by the end of this summer so that's something we're super proud of and obviously bare-metal will be right behind that and it'll probably not have rock band names associated with it so watch this space it's a major new kind of area for us we have all the technology we needed composability we've kind of solved the composability problem now we needed kind of the portal with one sphere and all that we've learned by doing that program we have kind of the self-service portal thing we needed paper use with Greenlake we've got a ton of business and a ton of momentum on Greenlake so we know how to do that part of it now we're just expanding and building are operated for you kind of capability but I would encourage you as you leave discover think about how does this as a service affect what I'm gonna be doing how would it affect what I'm doing could I get my staff to focus more on enabling the new apps enabling the developers enabling those kind of things and have hpe delivered to me more as a service so that I can deliver to my customers as a service I think if there's one thing from this discover that you really want to stew on that is a huge one because we're at that knee of the curve trust me we're there and it's gonna change a lot in the next three to five years so hopefully from this you've looked at ok start thinking about rather than how do I get my data into one cloud think about how do I bring the cloud experience to my different data how do I go through my infrastructure and start enabling it as code so that I'm ready for this me and the curve how do I break those silos and start thinking about the fact that I'm gonna need a whole bunch of partners I'm gonna be need multiple public clouds I'm gonna need a whole bunch of on-prem capability and I'm gonna need a way to deliver that and then that as a service and then finally how am i how are you going to deliver to your internal customers everything that they need to consume as a service whether it's on Prem off pram or whatever they're doing and hopefully you'll remember back to this discover and go that was a pretty a pretty big change in the way that we thought about what it is that we're doing in our air so thank you for coming to discover there's a couple of things to watch for first Pradeep Kumar my peer and partner in crime in this hole as a service kind of space the guy who actually does the delivery the part of operate it for you my team does the technology so enabling the portal and enabling the experience and all that his team does the delivery angle his keynote is in two hours in this same room so if you want to hear more about that please come back Antonio's keynote at 2:00 p.m. that will definitely talk a little bit about consumption and as a service and kind of the the bold move are making as a company and for sure go visit the show floor because you can see a lot of the stuff that I have not just the creative example that we put there but the actual demo of our Greenlake marketplace in action what we have implemented what VMs as a service looks like kind of where we're going as a company thank you for attending discover and thank you for attending the keynote
