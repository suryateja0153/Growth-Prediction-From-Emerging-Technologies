 IT organizations want to spend less time deploying and managing hardware and more time delivering IT services. With HPE OneView we have the capability to deploy servers consistently and automatically apply changes across our environment using server profile templates. With our template previously configured, we can now use the template to deploy new server profiles for any compliant servers. From the HPE OneView main dashboard we can navigate in a few clicks to server profile templates. The server profile template we previously configured 'Hypervisor_1 Template' will show up as an available option to deploy on the left. Using the actions menu, we select 'create a new server profile.' We first need to choose a unique name for our server profile, which in this demo is Host-1. We then choose the server hardware that matches the server hardware type, as defined in the Server Profile template. We will need to identify the 'World Wide Name' for the fibre channel connection we attached in the template. For Gen10 Servers this can accomplished all within HPE OneView. Selecting the server from the server hardware list, that part of our template, we can quickly identify the 'World Wide Name'. Copying this we can then paste it back into the profile we were creating under the fibre channel connection. We are ready to create! The server profile we just configured includes all of the network connections, firmware configurations and device drivers. Later we will configure local storage, storage volumes and zones to the target server. After a few minutes, these servers are provisioned and ready for hypervisor OS and application installation. HPE OneView provides consistency by automatically configuring the hardware as defined in the 'server profile template,' saving IT admins time on deploying and managing their infrastructure.
