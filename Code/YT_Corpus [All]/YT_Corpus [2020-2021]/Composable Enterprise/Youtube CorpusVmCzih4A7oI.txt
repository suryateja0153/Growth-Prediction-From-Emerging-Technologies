 The HPE OneView Global Dashboard extends the unified view across multiple data centers anywhere in the world, providing a simple, efficient, and unified view of the shared storage pools and the health status of servers, profiles, and enclosures. After logging in, we will review the health of our environment and how to resolve a resource alert. HPE OneView Global Dashboard aggregates critical activities from multiple appliances into a single feed, so we can readily identify problems with our monitored hardware and promptly resolve them. At a quick glance we will see green is healthy, yellow is when an event occurred that might require our attention, and red indicates a critical issue that needs immediate attention. If we see gray is disabled or has an unknown status. To review a warning or critical error, we can click directly from the dashboard or navigate using the menu and then search for any attribute associated with a resource to quickly find and navigate to the desired item Clicking on the appliance directs us to HPE OneView where we can quickly gain insight to remediate the servers warning. In HPE OneView, we can review all the detailed warnings on this server. Selecting edit, takes us into the 'server profile template' options, where we see our firmware bundle previously selected needs to be changed as it no longer exists in our environment. Selecting 'OK', HPE OneView then updates the template, resolving the known critical alert. Searching for the alert again in HPE OneView Global Dashboard, we'll see the changes that we made in HPE OneView are updated in real time back into HPE OneView Global Dashboard and the alert is no longer visible, as we resolved it. HPE OneView Global Dashboard builds on the core HPE OneView capabilities by adding visibility and health reporting across multiple appliances in different geographic regions.
