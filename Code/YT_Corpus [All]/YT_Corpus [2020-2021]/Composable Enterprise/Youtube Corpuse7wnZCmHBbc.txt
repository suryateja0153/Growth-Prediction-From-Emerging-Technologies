 The way that we look at PCIe inside the data center is - it's a data center first right now what's going on. For the first time in the data center, we have all the core data center resources actually living on a common bus. When storage migrated away from SATA and SAS and move to MVME, which lives on the PCIe bus. And when data center resources like GPUs and FPGAs now became relevant in the data center, they also live on the PCIe bus. It's the first time in the data center where we have all the core resources speaking a common language - compute, networking, storage, GPUs, FPGAs - all of these devices for the first time speak to each other over that common bus, that common language, which is PCIe and this is the common thread that makes our solution bare metal capable. Without having these things, all speaking the same language, you'd be reliant on technologies like virtualization, protocol translation, electrical translation. The fact that all of these things connect together by PCIe is what enables us to compose at the bare metal. So for today, PCIe is the appropriate interface to interconnect all of these devices together. In the future, if there is a better interconnect something like a GenZ, we fully plan to adopt to the appropriate physical interface that's out there. Today, the appropriate physical interface is PCIe.
