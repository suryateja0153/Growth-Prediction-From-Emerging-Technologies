 hello everyone thank you for joining us our topic today is hybrid IT performance monitoring strategy my name is cha Chi Quan where's Willa our agenda today is we'll be starting with a brief introduction about Willa that they're very quickly diving to the three phases that I'm going to talk about today that is about IT hybrid IT performance monitoring strategy started out with the planning phase of migration to the hybrid IT environment and then followed by during migration what should be your strategy and continuation from your planning phase and finally after the migration fully into hybrid IT what are the strategy that you should devise to have a great performance monitoring solution and lastly we will do a very quick demo to see what we pitched today can be really realized and materialized in today's enterprise data center for hybrid IT and lastly I will close it with the question and answer excellent so some quick facts about Willa Oh mom was with us early we are a startup company based in Silicon Valley California we are about seven years so sure being enterprise IT organization helped in performance monitoring on their data center whether it is the hybrid cloud private cloud or a public call purely our solution basically contain our core technology started out with deep packet inspection by using our virtual network traffic tab we are able to deploy the software based solution quickly do the packet inspection understand the network in your private public or hybrid environment and more importantly is from the networking intelligence and knowledge through the packet inspection to build out the application level visibility from application and the mapping application transaction analysis and also integrate our solution with your private cloud virtualization technology or public cloud infrastructure server resource information and in the end provide a full stack application centric monitoring and performance management solution serving the IT world around the globe so so much about how our company and let's dive into our topic today so first thing that what I mention is that today's topic and the content a lot of it is devised from a survey that we did about a year ago with VMware the expert communities these are the people who you know in many years ago are managing purely just private cloud environment using the VMware virtualization technology which you know most of the enterprise today you know on the private cloud environment are you know virtualized 95 or 100 percent so these are the folks who actually took their data center used to be in private cloud into the hybrid or public cloud environment so we did a survey within to learn from their experience that they did actually heads up for the last few years and share that with you folks today Australia there are a lot of performance monte strategy and failure and pitfall that they experienced including what you see on the screen you know started out from the planning phase just not knowing the current data center to the migration phase being continuously surprised and they're not validating you know step by step and finally after they are fully in a hybrid environment you know with the hybrid silo what have they learned you know from what should be done and what could be avoided through that entire experience this particular survey and recommendation by the VIII expert community contacted by Willa and VMware the expert can be downloadable it's from our website UIL a Willa calm so feel free to download copy if you like today's session that may be of interest to you to learn from their experiences and recommendation about hybrid 90 ok so first thing that we're going to talk about today is We strongly believe to devise a hybrid IT performance monitoring strategy must start from before you actually go into hyper IT before your migration with a strong planning phase in understanding your current data center situation so you know leveraging the survey that we did with the expert community you know we did ask the expert community what are the top three concerns you know when you move your data center to a hybrid environment and the answer come back with three things that's most significant to us number one is I don't even know what application will show us this wrong in my data center many of them are managing the virtualized environment they may know I got 200 or 3,000 virtual machine plus physical server many many application servers but what service to do they deliver and more so secondly how the server interacted with each other I may have 3000 application servers virtual or physical but I deliver 200 services so apparently all these servers work together to deliver you know single or a collection of services how do they actually interconnect they have the interdependency the expert actually have you know great doubts and then great black holes about that particular piece of knowledge yes show me with that you know what they would be inviting them to be the third concern would be as they move to the hybrid car how should i design my security rests the security naturally is number three or should I see a number three probably number one concerning here for the community the next survey that we asked them is what is the most what are the most time-consuming parts of your hybrid cloud migration right and then you probably can already guess right they didn't know the application they didn't know the intern dependency that actually cost them a lot of time to figure out some of them are using tools some of them are initially actually just use the in pencil and paper to interview the application owner interviewed the IT staff to build that application level knowledge to do the interdependency and naturally that's very time-consuming and what they have told us is that by the time they are done figuring out the intern dependency the dependency has already changed I should also say the survey also asked them the question about how long do they usually take to migrate a single applications and the answer come backs it's not days it's not weeks it's actually you know over months time period so surely over that 10 months time up a few months or months the dependency can surely change so the time-consuming part is again application discovery dependency and next is architecting in the hybrid cloud based on that knowledge about the application these are the most time-consuming part a third a question about the survey I do want to share is what do they see as the most critical to them again very consistently application discovery application dependency is something that deemed very very important for successful migration to the hybrid destination but they also mention for the data center that they are managing now it is critically important for them to know the current performance criteria how fast how slow is my application response time before I even move a single bit of my application to the cloud as well as what are my end user experiences are they experiences 5 min a second of the RP application or are they experienced 20 millisecond of delay you know from their home or their remote office of my healthcare application that type of thing they do want to have a I'd answer so that during and after migration you can have a reference point about how much you have improved the situation terms of service level so then those are all interesting and important critical points for us to pay attention to so you know to summarize the migration planning the first phase of the IT performance monitoring strategy is that all these things can be very complicated it can be very time-consuming and they all suggested that you should use - don't use pencil and paper don't do just this interview process asking people who how they build it you know five ten or even longer time ago use - to get this done instantaneously or at least fast to build up and discover your application build up the discovery build up the dependency mapping so you can have a successful migration as well as create your baseline for your application performance and user experience and then also what is your server infrastructure resource consumption basis right at the bottom of the screen is kind of a embodiment of some of the - actually this is our - how it would be able to automatically create this dependency for you for particular applications so this is one examples alright and then so much about you know planning for migration and the finally sooner or later you have to start migrating right so the survey question that we asked for the community is how and what is your approach in terms of migrating your application and interestingly you know 25 21 percent or so of the staff they actually do this what we call the lift and shift or big band migration you know over and I they move all the servers involving an app and an application to the cloud or to the final destination but you know 3/4 of them or 80% of them are actually doing the iterative approach that is step by step carefully you know move one server on one piece at the time so that is probably something that I would personally recommend and probably is a more prudent way of doing this - move it step by step and show it can be done that way the majority of the folks aren't doing it that way so if you choose to do it one way or the other what are the important thing to pay attention to the survey tells us is that to have a successful migration is to validate as you move right migrate was confidence you move a SAP you see it happen as you see on the screen this is the similar application dependency mapping as you can see when when you are purely private this is the face where you are actually moving already and you see the bottom of the screen you have to you know red ball these are in the public cloud section as you move them you want to see them move you want to see them talk with linkage of dependency whatever linkage and dependency in communication you expect to see happen you do want to see that happen like the communication from the private cloud all the way to the public cloud and from the public cloud here the two were close or to virtual machines as you deploy they do talk back you want to make sure they are talking back in the way in the architect you designed it to and whatever you didn't design to have happen you don't want to have seeing the line that is pointing back to an end expected recipient that created extra traffic causing surprises or even fail out the deployment so mobile as you go or migrate and validate is something that the recommendation is and during the migration not only you see what should happen is happening you also pay attention you you know the performance out of that are we responding slower or the networking round-trip time getting slower application response time due to the allocated a server resources are limiting are they responding slower all these should be monitored along the process so actually you know you may have the monitoring solution for your private cloud as you start to move the first piece of your infrastructure or application into the cloud your performance monitoring solution today for your private cloud is already and should have being exercised to see if it can see the hybrid environment because you are gonna need it when you move the first piece of your server application okay and what happens after you migrate everything to the cloud right or to the hybrid environment what are the challenges so you know one interesting question that we asked the expert community is have you been various or have you seen anyone be embarrassed that they wrote over to the cloud and then have to roll back and then surely as you see on the response 48.8% of them have personally experienced the rollback due to failure or they have known their colleagues having to roll back from the hybrid cloud public cloud migration and then we asked them what are the reason for the failure and then in the end there are two things that jumps out at us number one is we move it over it was singly running finding the beginning and finally the application would slow down or not working and troubleshooting or restoring application performance to the previous accessible level they cannot achieve that therefore they have to roll back to the private cloud to start over again redesign or find out the root cause but in the meanwhile they have to roll back to continue the critical service the other reason for them to roll back is they just hit some surprises the things that they didn't know and and hit them you know out of the blue so that's you know two major reason for them to have to roll back so in the end in the hybrid environment you know troubleshooting is inevitable monitoring strategy and performance management strategy would include you know all the components that you see on the screen right you have your networking team you have your application team you have your application run some hybrid cloud you have your server infrastructure you also have your cloud and when application don't work or slow down it could be in any place right that's the challenge before you migrate and getting powers hybrid IT everything is pure private on-premise as you get into cloud it's yet another silo so this gets into the silo complexity not only just the the team you may have a cloud operations team but also the tools maybe you would acquire another tool to manage your cloud so the silo team is single tool actually cost troubleshooting and performance management even more issues what we seen on the market and in the real world is you know when performance issue a crisis happened the warm situation would usually involve multiple team and multiple tools everybody's dashboard from the tool from their silo tools all green except when they do compare notes they couldn't find out why the application performance running slow so he just run time and time and time could have resolved and find the root cause the stress is high and in the meanwhile the application is not working or very soul costing enterprise money in employee productivity or production capacity or even revenue loss due to e-commerce not functioning things like that so it's pretty painful and usually how people deal with that you know in that situation the higher ID person higher than another guy because they feel that they need more skillsets to solve this type of issue or then buy more silo tools to cover some visibility host or they kind of close their eye across a finger hope and hopeful that the problem will just disappear tomorrow sometime it does except it'll just come back two months later or the most common one is many of the enterprise that we experience they just buy more server resources just make the server bigger and bigger or in the cloud just buy more from the college service provider thinking the problem which is go away and many of these actually don't work and then actually do not work in many many cases we think there's a better way to do this that is something that we advocate for is something that we call the hybrid IT performance monitoring with full staff visibility for multi cloud environment so the idea is that you have your application that runs some of the cloud environment your IT staff tour networking staff or your server infrastructure system folks they need to have application visibility because the application is what they support they're not the application developer yet that they do need to have that visibility into the application or to the application to fully support it and they need to be able to see each other's data in one single to one single pane of gas everything correlated together so in the next kind of graphic is kind of how we see the tool the the silo should be consolidated and correlated in a way where the application visibility need to be provided to the IT staff to the net ops to the system mean and where the you know I teach that may and definitely will need to see each other's data so they can correlate across the club boundary and compare data to have a full stack correlated view for better monitoring for performance optimization as well as for performance troubleshooting so this is kind of what we believe and as we deliver a solution that we believe this can be very quickly and easily achieved that will be helping you know the community and the market with our solution to achieve this type of strategy and this type of a vision so without that you know to back up what my claim is for this type of monitoring strategy I would like to give you a very very quick demo to just give you a taste of you know what can be delivered and how we deliver it before the light demo I just want to mention a few things about what's happening behind the thing when you see the demo number one is our our technology as I mentioned early on does use deep packet inspection but we do use virtual network traffic tab these are virtual machines virtual taps that get our hands on to every single packet right so we do deep packet analysis of these packets flowing between your virtual machine for virtual machine to the physical server for physical server to networking devices or even all the way to your cloud we're close we get our hands on those packet to deep packet inspection as well as we do or so application discovery because we Deepak an inspection into the application layer and because we can discover application understand and classify three thousand-plus application we measure their application response time we measure their transaction and more importantly we build their application dependency mapping in a very distributed way and then also our and other technology is not just about networking in not just about application it is also about your server infrastructure right the CPU the memory and the storage system are all very important for your hybrid IT whether they are sitting in your private cloud or in AWS or a Google cloud environment these are all resources that you pay dearly for and we do integrate with them so we can correlate and we do believe you need to correlate application response that we saw those server infrastructure components as well not only those cost money but also they impact the performance therefore our claim is who that hybrid IT correlation and troubleshooting can be done in such a fashion that is most efficient for the hybrid IT strategy so having said that I'll just show a few very quick screenshots or a life running of our solution so what you see on the screen is what we automatically discovered application dependency mapping right this is one single service but see as you see on the screen it's already consisting of you know maybe ten application sugars already and not only you see the inter dependency what service do they serve you know how are their application response time this is not just a point in time but you build up with a series of time will generate reporting for all this type of information as well as for this application dependency mapping we also generate CSV file the spreadsheet so you can see not only who's talking to who what application they are what pours TCP or UDP ports that they are using so when you're designing your networking kind of firewall for security purposes you all know what to block what do that through or so how much traffic volumes are going through between all these links right all these traffic volume if you were to move anything to the cloud the traffic over here definitely would be of great concern because you may have to pay for it once you are in the cloud so all these detailed information you know can be pulled out very quickly by using our solution typically our solution deployment is about an hour or two for you know hundreds if not thousands of the application were closed and then generating this kind of graph it's just you know a few minutes you can automatically discover all these so this is before you migrate to the cloud you have all these and also you will have the baseline for the performance of any application so you know what your baseline is and also you know the end user experience and also during migration during migration as you migrate you know as a time our claim and our recommendation is during migration you want to see it as you migrate and what you will see during migration is this type of thing as you move to different places where as you go moving time you can started to see your work lo showed up in the cloud your private cloud environment continued to be there and then all these things you're seeing these communication and work clothes coming together across the club boundary this should be something that you expect them to happen for example this one you can mouse over to it this is a sequel transaction or sequel connection you know going through how my traffic Bali made it is how fast is the response time all the way down to when something don't work or starting to slow down it needs to be quickly correlate able into what is slow it should be so why is this slow clicking on HTTP for quick troubleshooting HTTP application response time CPU is under provisioned back-end server my sequel service industry of them are all responding good storage system as little slow CPUs really slow click into CPU information to look at all the CPU information to help you troubleshoot really quickly dumb to process level right all these are you know pretty easy and clickable to have everything in your fingertip during migration and even after migration troubleshooting is using the same tool where you can see what is going on you know in any particular server and to whatever sugar and then this is not as we this is not just about application or networking rate this all these things you see can be correlated into CPU memory storage from the application level down or the full stack nature of what we pitch is from the infrastructure level up as well meaning in your hybrid IT you want your IT folks be able to your net Ops guys be able to see the networking see the networking data were analyzing every single packet so strongly now working it is not stress how the flow is the morning you're looking at networking you definitely want them to have the application visibility searching here you can see the application is HTTP my sequel and the sum of the TCP transaction here as well so these are you know the visibility that definitely need and talents a tons of them now I'm working analysis in one single pend of a gap class right I don't have too much time I probably need to wrap up fast but I want you to get the idea that it's not just application down but oceans from the infrastructure up into application as well networking is an example CPU analysis for your hybrid cloud environment right whether this is your on-prem database or cloud you're going to be able to see it for memory for memory analysis where the hotspot is as well as storage system performance and the key is always you see the hot spot whatever they are and also you see what application it is such as this virtual machine is storage system is slow it is this application correlation wise you correlate quickly from the application response time quickly to CPU memory storage and back-end services for troubleshooting purposes so these are all very quick and easily done and then before I adjourn this session I do want to have one quick call for action that is we're offering you know we want to pitch
