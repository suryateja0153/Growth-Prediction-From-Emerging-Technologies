 One of our beliefs is that devices like M.2 storage is a fundamental building block of the data center. It's lower power, lower cost, higher volume, very well suited for data center environments. The challenge is there aren't any sockets or very limited sockets to be able to deploy these M.2 devices in mass - inside the data center. So one of the things that LIQID does with its fabric technology is we create these sockets to be able to deploy M.2 inside the data center. For example: we have carriers that are the form factor of a half height, half length card. We have other carriers that are the form factor of a full height, full length card. We have other carriers that are in the form factor of a U.2 device. And the main purpose of these carrier fabrics is to be able to leverage lower cost M.2 devices and deploy them in the data center, but still realize full data center class functionality, things like dual ported capability, power loss protection, higher capacity, higher performance. By deploying these storage devices and coupling them tightly with our PCIe fabric technology, we can deliver even more compelling solutions to the data center users.
