 First off... I believe same as NAND and solid state storage has not displaced spinning media, right? Also don't see a world where, uh, it is going to be only cloud where cloud displaces all the, uh, on-prem infrastructure and data centers. I would say...um, there's been a trend and a momentum away from on-prem to the cloud, right? In the last a few years, and a lot of it has been, has been material, right? Um, but I think, and, and again, the, the industry believes that this bi-modal IT or multi-cloud environment, is only going to accelerate, right? We're gonna want to access our data easier in, in more ways and also have multiple copies of our data, some on-prem, some off in a, you know, potentially the public cloud. So I think all of us are going to co-exist and kind of grow together simply because of the acceleration and the creation of data on how much we need to, uh, manage a process that data. But I think the last decade or so, the idea, especially when you look at CIOs and kind of the executive...business...uh, managers has been that cloud is cheaper, right? Uh, and if I go to cloud, I will be able not only to have...an easier access to data and the way to, to kind of manage that data, but also to save at the bottom line. And we have numerous instances out there where we see folks like Dropbox, you know, pulling their infrastructure back in house, away from the public cloud. Uh, guys like, you know, Salesforce, uhm, you know, ServiceNow and other enterprise clouds out there...that they, they do manage their own infrastructure and, and they, they, they found that actually the bottom line, uh, he was also in favor of building their own infrastructure.
