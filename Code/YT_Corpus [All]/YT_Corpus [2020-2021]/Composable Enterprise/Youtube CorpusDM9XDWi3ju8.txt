 Remove the bezel from the front of the enclosure where the drives will be added, by squeezing the release on the left side and pivoting the bezel off of the front of the enclosure. Attach your ESD wrist strap to an unpainted surface of the enclosure or rack. Caution, once the drive blanks are removed you will have up to ten minutes to install the new drives to avoid overheating your Primera Storage System. Remove the drive blanks from the slots where the drives will go and retain for future use. For each drive, press the release button to open the drive handle. Align the drive with the release button at the top for Small Form Factor drives. Insert the drive until it begins to engage the drive handle. Press the drive handle to seat the drive into the mid-plane and lock it into place. Note, for regions and contracts with exceptions that support Large Form Factor, LFF drives, align the release button to the right for LFF drives. Do not leave any drive blanks, or blank slots between drives. Confirm all of the blinking green LEDs on the newly installed drives turn solid, indicating their integration into the storage system. Once normal drive activity starts, the green status LEDs will blink again. Next, tow in the right end of the enclosure bezel, squeezing the retention latch on the other end and gently but firmly press the bezel into place for each of the enclosures.
