 [Music] hey guys nakazi here welcome to another awesome video in today's video i'm going to touch base on sd-wan competitive landscape we're going to do a gartner magic quadrant review of the top three players in the sd-wan space and i'm gonna give you a no bs review so it's gonna be a very exciting one i'm pumped without further ado let's roll let's jump right into it here are the topics i plan on covering today first gartner magic quadrant second cisco viptela sd-wan third silver peak for vmware velocloud and finally i'm gonna give you a bunch of pro tips with that let me take you on a quick journey so here i am curiously wondering what's happening on those islands let's check them out we got four different islands here we got the gartner magic quadrant island cisco island silver peak island and vmware velocloud island let's get started with the gartner magic quadrant island here we're going to do a quick analysis of the gartner magic quadrant in particular we're going to look at the quadrant for when edge infrastructure this is the sd-wan quadrant gartner decided in their infinite wisdom to call it when edge infrastructure i'm being a bit cynical here but i think it's very appropriately named so gartner magic quadrant without getting into too much detail is divided into four different boxes called quadrants so we start off at the leaders quadrant which is the top right visionaries is the bottom right niche players is the bottom left challengers top left now instead of spending time in other quadrants we're just going to focus on leader squadron another item i want to draw your attention to is the x and y axes the y x's shows the ability to execute by each of these players and at the bottom we're seeing the completeness of vision so leaders are the ones that not only have a great vision but they have an amazing ability to execute that being said let's zoom into the leaders quadrant this year's gardener magic quartet is very unique in a sense that we have a lot of leaders that have emerged in 2020. last year in 2019 there were only two players that were considered leaders vmware velocloud and silver peak even cisco had been pushed into the challenger squadron in 2019 but in 2018 cisco is also in the leaders quadrant and the reason for cisco's shift had to do with the viptela acquisition and then cisco trying to shoehorn the ios xc into the viptela code so i think that kind of caused a little bit of that shuffle but that being said uh let's focus in on three players that i want to talk about today we'll talk about vmware velocloud we'll talk about cisco viptela and we'll talk about silver peak i'm not going to talk about the other guys in the leaders quadrant they have their own specialties but another element that i want to bring to your attention before we move on from here is there's a lot of interesting power play going on so palo alto networks acquired cloudgenix who specialized in sd-wan and silver peak was also recently acquired by hpe hp's sister company so it's really interesting what's going on in the sd-wan realm it's it's exciting times with that let's go ahead and take a look at the cisco solution real quick so we're gonna go ahead and visit the cisco island so guys in full disclosure i'm not gonna spend too much time on cisco today because my previous video is an in-depth analysis of cisco sd-wan so if you're really interested in doing a deep dive in cisco check out my previous video i'm gonna provide a card in this video so you can just tap on it and i will also provide a link down in the video description and i'm gonna also provide a bunch of other references in the description below so definitely check that out so let's jump right into the cisco solution so here's the high-level view of the cisco sd-wan architecture the first element i want to draw your attention to is the separation of the data plane control plane and the management plane data plane is the transport the routers the the circuits and all that and that's what we're looking at here in the red box uh cisco calls them either c edge or v v-edge depending on the type of appliance you have and you could either have a physical appliance or virtual appliance if you happen to have cloud-based connectivity you're going to spin up you know a vm there it's all ztp or zero touch provisioning based this is the the data plane component of it and you could have any type of transport mpls internet 4g lte whatever have you remember the whole idea of sd-wan is transport is irrelevant it's all about the overlay not the underlay and by the way the data plane component is also the underlay of the network now let's shift our attention to the control plane this is where the value proposition of sd-wan shines so here we separate the control plane from the routers and we have now moved that intelligence into the controllers in particular v smart controllers they're the brands of the entire solution and they're the ones that are responsible for pushing the routing and security configuration down to the routers at the at the bottom of the screen uh you're talking horizontal scale which means if you need uh to add more sd-wan appliances you you can just keep adding more and more v-smart controllers finally the management plane component and this is the key because vmanage is where everything happens this is the portal that you as a customer log into once you purchase a solution and from here you get to configure all the controllers and not only you get to configure but you can monitor you can troubleshoot you have a view of the entire sd-wan fabric right here in the v-managed controller you also have third-party apis that you can leverage different type of automation solutions as i mentioned earlier for more details watch my previous video for the sake of expediency i'm going to move to the next section now let's quickly take a look at the appliance portfolio so what cisco has is the traditional isr asr portfolio depending on your site you may be a good fit for an isr 1k or isr 4k or maybe an asr 1k it just depends uh if it's a branch site if it's a data center or something in between and if you happen to have cloud-based access into aws azure or gcp you're gonna have to spin up a csr-1k moving on to the next item when cisco acquired viptela for north of 600 million dollars this is the portfolio that cisco acquired the the vh platform from viptela they never got rid of it these appliances are still available and the reason they're available is because they're very cost effective now the big thing about these boxes the vh boxes is that they do not support security and if you're using the v edge boxes then of course if you have the infrastructure the service component like aws azure gcp you'll spin up the vh cloud finally the virtualization component these two boxes encs 5000 and csp 5000 you can run different virtual network functions watch my previous video to learn more and now let's shift our attention to silver peak i'm going to spend a little bit more time on silver peak and velocloud because i haven't created a separate video on either of these vendors so i want to make sure that you guys have a good understanding the silver peak sd-wan platform is called unity and there are three components to the entire solution the first piece is the unity orchestrator this is the brains of the entire solution this is the centralized controller you configure monitor and everything in between right here on the orchestrator it could be on-prem it could be in the cloud or you can have it as a orchestrator as a service where silver peak hosts the orchestrator in their cloud and you get access to it and that's typically the most recommended way of doing sd-wan is to go with the cloud-based orchestrator because it's a lot more simpler however another component to keep in mind is that when you do get the cloud-based orchestrator there's typically additional cost associated with it not every single vendor will charge you but most of them will do for hosting the orchestrator in their cloud because naturally they have to spend resources on your behalf to let that orchestrator be available and they typically do a pretty good job they have high availability set up as well so you don't have to worry about it but just wanted to share that tip with you second element of the solution is the unity edge connect these are the boxes that you'll have in a physical form factor or a in a virtual form in the cloud and these are the sd-wan appliances these are the data plane devices and finally the third element of the solution is an optional component and that is the boost license and boost is the wan optimization component one thing to keep in mind guys is silver peak were when up or when optimization specialists before they got involved with sd-wan so they have really amazing when optimization capability and they actually brought all that secret sauce from their wen optimization realm and merged it into the sd-wan code and i think that really gives seller peak an edge in the industry when it comes to their sd-wan offering but once again this is an optional component you don't have to get it this is something you could get the big benefit being you don't have to buy another wan optimization box if you happen to be big into anop with silver peak sd-wan you can get rid of the hardware and combine that functionality or consolidate it into the same hardware so it's more like a one box type solution which kind of makes it once again attractive from a financial standpoint now let's shift our attention to the silver peak unity edge connect hardware portfolio so as you can see here on the screen you what you have is t-shirt size style model numbers so edge connect ultra small extra small small all the way up to extra large and as you can see third row down uh typical when bandwidth this is where you look at the model name of the box and then match it with the wan bandwidth remember guys with sd-wan we look at the circuits that we have and how much capacity we're going to need on that box and the wind bandwidth shown here is the total bandwidth whether you have a single circuit or you have multiple circuits the key to pay attention to is all together that's the maximum when throughput you're going to get on that box and you also want to look at the type of features you want to subscribe to and make sure you pick the right box we'll talk more about that in a bit now let's visit the vmware velocloud island velocloud solution is divided into three components first let's look at the green box we have the vmware sd-wan edge it's a virtual edge there's a lot of flexibility in deployment it's a purpose-built hardware offered by velocloud they also work closely with dell for for fulfillment purposes on top of having a physical hardware you can also have a virtual edge in the cloud which is pretty much the same as any other sd-wan vendor but what is unique about velocloud is the fact that you have the ability to run a vnf or a virtual network function specifically a third-party vnf right on your sd-wan appliance for example palo alto network firewall you have the ability to run a virtual instance of a pan firewall right on your velocloud sd-man appliance once again making it very attractive one box solution approach very interesting and unique from that perspective and you can have a branch data center cloud whatever have you the box below it in aqua here we look at the orchestrator and the controllers this is the portal that you log into this is the brains of the entire solution this is where everything happens this is where you configure your business policies this is where the apis are if you want to do third party automation this is where the zero touch provisioning is done and this is where you can figure all the templates and everything you also monitor the environment here you can have it running on vmware if it's in a virtual form or your service provider might have it hosted or you could have the controller on-prem but one thing to keep in mind is uh you have to get special approval if you want to run it on-prem depending on the deal size this is not something velocloud offers by default to all the customers so to me it's a bit of a negative but it's not a huge negative because about 95 of the customers are completely fine with a cloud hosted orchestrator and a controller model they don't really need to deploy the controllers on-prem but if you happen to be on the on-prem side of the house this is something to keep in mind and as i mentioned you can figure your policies there your apis and your zero touch provisioning now let's move on to the final box here vmware sd-wan gate phase now this is also something unique to velocloud and what's happening here is we have optimized cloud on-ramp so if you guys are familiar with the previous video i did called cisco cloud onramp it's the same idea here but the big difference is vmware has already set up multiple gateways hundreds of gateways across the globe and in those gate phase they have their appliances sitting and they're constantly monitoring the quality of connectivity into the different sas and ias providers and they're constantly detecting which path is better and which location is better from a geography perspective and they redirect the traffic based on how the traffic is performing and how the servers are responding in real time so it's a unique value proposition from vmware it's fully managed by vmware you don't have to worry about it all you have to do is just make sure you have the appropriate licensing tier so you have this function available it's multi-tenant and as i mentioned these gateways are strategically placed in different top-tier network points of presence or pops around the globe and the vmware sd-wan edge portfolio it's divided into small medium and large the smallest box being edge 510 to the largest box being edge 3800 for example if you have a location that needs a 500 meg connectivity you'll pick edge 610 box if you happen to have a site that requires 2 gig connectivity you're going to need an edge at 40 bucks if that site also requires a third party vnf being ran on the same box you could run a virtual instance of a pan firewall right on your edge 840 box and finally if you have a site that has a requirement of 10 plus gig connectivity you're going to pick the edge 3800 bucks now that being said a lot is happening in the sd-wan space at a very fast pace guys so don't kill the messenger by the time you're watching this video and you're talking to vmware and some of these boxes are end of life or are no longer available because like i said a lot is happening new silicon new chipset so new pieces of hardware are constantly being rolled out so take some of the hardware information that i'm sharing with you with a grain of salt and just make sure you refer to your vendor documentation for up-to-date information and now let me talk about the most exciting stuff the pro tips let me take a moment to emphasize this right here is a money shot this is the money slide okay if you could take just one key takeaway from this entire conversation today it's right here this is not something you're gonna find in books this is not something you're gonna be able to find in documentation this is based on real world experience that i've acquired over the years as a solution architect talking to different vendors and and customers and reading different documentation so this right here could easily save you days worth of research let's jump right in let's look at row by row so vmware and silver peak only have a single controller whereas cisco has three separate controllers now i believe cisco did themselves a little bit of a disservice by creating three separate controllers because it confuses a lot of the customers but the reality of the matter is guys you don't have to touch any of those additional controllers you only mess with the v manage everything else is behind the scenes you never touch them they're automatically configured to remanage second element packet loss compensation and that's a big one technologies like forward error correction and packet order correction and packet duplication and here silver peak shines based on some of the research i've done and some of the customers that i've talked to silver peak is able to handle up to 10 packet loss compensation so you could be on a broadband circuit experience up to 10 packet loss and your voice and video will still be okay that is massive cisco recently introduced their forward error correction and packet duplication it's there not sure how great that is because it's a recent feature time will tell but cisco just recently rolled it out and with vmware you can expect around 2 packet loss compensation the next element per packet load sharing versus flow based load sharing even though the cisco documentation says it's less intrusive to do flow based load sharing because you're not doing asymmetrical routing and all that however i do know that silver peak for example can also do float flow based load sharing as well so keeping that in mind i think they're all on par and their own proprietary technology that they use is pretty good at doing the load sharing piece of it now another element to keep in mind is uh the vrf segmentation so with vmware only up to 16 vrfs are supported silver peak uses vxlan based segmentation they call them bios or business intent overlays maximum i believe they only support seven that number might change tomorrow but as of this video only seven business intent overlays are supported cisco however offer unlimited segmentation they call it unlimited but there are physical limitations on the box as far as how many vrfs you can create i think it taps out between two to three hundred that's a lot i have yet to see a clear real world use case for having that many vrfs next up this is for the geeks out there vmware uses vcmp or velocloud management protocol silverpeak uses subnet sharing and cisco uses omp or overlay management protocol from a handoff perspective both vmware and velocloud can only do ethernet handoff copper or fiber based whereas cisco is unique in a sense that they can offer ethernet or tdm with tdm being t1 t3 or ds1 ds3 those type of circuits now most of the customers today could care less about tdm everybody is pretty much on ethernet but just wanted to throw it out there in case if you had some tdm circuits in your environment next up is both vmware and silver peak for the most part tell the customers that you should look into a secure internet gateway or a cloud access security broker somebody like a z scaler or could be any other cloud-based security vendor but that's what they recommend however as i mentioned earlier with velocloud you have the ability to host third-party vnf locally if you wanted to do that and cisco is unique in a sense that they have their own full-blown security so you can do layer 7 app firewall you can do ips and ids you can do url filtering you can do advanced malware protection and you can do umbrella dns security all configured on the viptela box so once again cisco is in a unique position there cisco also supports cloud-based security next up is the wen optimization silver peak shines there vela cloud doesn't do any optimization whereas viptela has the van op on the roadmap as far as i know silver peak is a clear winner next up unified communication features or voice features so if you have cucm express running on your routers cisco started supporting this feature a couple of months ago and it's there so cisco's clearly a leader in that regard and finally if you're a full cisco shop if you have invested a ton of money with cisco and if you happen to have a ton of cisco switches and you also have cisco sd-wan cisco has started integrating sd-wan and software-defined access or sda via sgt's or security group tags or scalable group tags so you can actually have a unified policy across the board so it's kind of a unique element from that perspective and cisco has already started pushing these features out as i speak so once again cisco is clearly a leader in that regard that being said let's talk about key differentiators vmware velocloud because of their third-party vnf i believe that's their unique differentiator silver peak their 10 percent packet loss plus their when up capability absolutely key differentiators there for cisco viptela there they have multiple handoff options so if you have a very diversified handoff requirement for your circuits cisco is a clear winner and also if you want to do local firewall local ids ips on your sd-wan appliances cisco is a clear winner in that area now let's move on to the key as demand questions that you need to be concerned with in order to design a best practice as demand solution so what you need to be looking at is when is your wan contract up you need to look at when is your hardware contract coming up for renewal how many sites do you have on mpls can you take advantage of being on can you maybe ditch a couple of mpls circuits and use internet instead how many sites do you have all together this is important because that will help you understand the scale so you can pick the right vendor that is capable of handling that many sites circuits you need to see the the type and the size of those circuits whether or not those circuits are active active today if not as demand can help you there any performance issues that you have today whether or not your when routers are currently being managed by a third party or if you're managing them whether or not you need to isolate different business units if you do how many do you have do you have a distributed firewall model where you have a firewall at each site or do you backhaul all the traffic to the to your data center because of a centralized security model who's your firewall vendor this question is important because that will help you understand whether or not the sd-man vendor you're about to pick if they play nice with your firewall vendor if you happen to be a 100 cisco shop how recent are your isr and sr routers if they're fairly recent you probably don't need to buy new isrs and asrs you can just probably do a software upgrade on them to enable sd-wan functionality through ios xc if you happen to be a meraki shop if you have a lot of meraki aps and switches maybe meraki sd-man is a good solution i know we didn't talk about meraki as demand today but it's also a pretty decent solution if you don't need a lot of bells and whistles it gets the job done maybe meraki is the way to go if you already have their access points and switches maybe do a full stack meraki something to think about next up what are your business critical applications and finally what's your cloud strategy it's important to understand your cloud strategy because that will help you determine whether or not you need the cloud on-ramp type feature provided by the different sd-man vendors and finally sd-wan gotchas the pitfalls things you want to avoid otherwise they will get you big time first up advanced routing if you have a very complex network that requires very advanced level bgp and ospf and all that you may want to look at vendors that are really really good with advanced routing so among the three that we talked about today cisco is a clear leader in advanced routing neither velocloud nor silver peak have any advanced routing capabilities they have bare bone routing capabilities their whole idea is once you switch to sdn you could care less about routing but the reality is until you get to sd-wan you're going to live with a brownfield environment with a hybrid environment where you're going to have some sites on sd-wan others on traditional wind you better make sure that you don't have any advanced routing needs if you do you you better pick the right vendor second one up sd van appliance total throughput so if you're gonna start enabling advanced features like on cisco for example if you're going to do advanced firewall and ips ids and amp and all that stuff you better make sure in advance that you understand the total throughput requirements because the box you initially thought you needed you may have to go to the next level up or maybe two levels up to pick the right box for your sites because now you're turning on all these different bells and whistles from a vpn segmentation perspective the key question here is do you need multiple overlays within the same as demand fabric or do you need multi-tenancy and have separate sd-wan fabrics and what i mean by that is to answer the first question if you need multiple overlays within the same as demand fabric that's an easy thing to solve you just need to make sure you have the ability to create multiple vrfs or multiple segments or vpns whereas if you need multi-tenancy then you better make sure that your sd man vendor has robust multi-tenancy capabilities and when i say multi-tenancy that means each tenant has its own set of controllers and its own sd-man fabric completely segmented from each other completely separate number four security for the most part if you have existing firewalls by all means use them if they're not end of life if they're not end of support and if you have already invested money in them don't get rid of them because the reality of the matter is a lot of the vendors have started offering security features on the same box but the security isn't really that reliable yet and the boxes start to take a lot of big hit when you enable security so i would closely watch this space for the next year or two until then keep your firewalls don't get rid of them multicast if you have multicast most of the sd-wan vendors do not support advanced you know full-blown multicast so you may want to retain your ce routers if you have very robust multicast in your environment today otherwise what you would want to do is some of the sdma vendors do have very strong multicast capabilities make sure you pick the right one and sit down with their engineering team and the sales engineer and the solutions architect and figure out and design the environment appropriately and the final tip i have for you guys is licensing and this is a very important one guys most vendors have three different licensing tiers make sure you understand them intimately create your feature wish list tell your sd-wan vendor what features you're interested in if you don't need all the bells and whistles you don't and don't let your vendor dictate that you do okay so make sure you sit down spend some time during the planning phase and figure out what are the key features you need make sure you understand licensing really really well before ordering gear if you order hardware before doing the licensing homework guys this misstep could cost you significantly this could be a huge financial hit because once you order everything and you start deploying and then in the middle you find out that you needed more features and now the boxes that you have are not capable of running those features because the minute you start enabling those features your box is going to take a throughput hit and now you have to upgrade if you have 10 000 sites you know that's a big hit i mean you don't want to go bankrupt so make sure that you do your your engineering homework ahead of time and you're good to go and that wraps up today's video hopefully you guys enjoyed today's video if you did give me a thumbs up hit subscribe and i'll see you in the next video
