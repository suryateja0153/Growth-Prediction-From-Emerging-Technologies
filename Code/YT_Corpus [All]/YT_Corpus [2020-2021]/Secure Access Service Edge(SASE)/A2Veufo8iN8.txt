 Hey everybody, I'm Josh Lupresto, VP of Sales Engineering coming to you live here from Telarus office and I'm joined here today with Sean Macarthy who's Director of Sales Engineering for Cato. So today we're here with a new Gartner category and I'm going to turn it over to Sean to tell us what this category is. Sure, thank you. So the new category is called SASE. It stands for Secure Access Service Edge and at Cato we've been hearing from day one from customers about how if they had the time, resources, and money they'd actually build Cato as their network if they could. So we're happy that Gartner is kind of seeing the same thing and it starting to recognize where the network is going. So what does this mean to you partners and why do you care? You know anytime that you can lead in with a provider who is brand new and created this space with Gartner that's a good thing because your customers are going to go research that and they're going to come to you to ask "What do I do here?" and you've now got a great solution. So more information coming soon, stay tuned and we'll share that with you as soon as we have it. So thanks for coming in Sean. Appreciate it. Appreciate you being here. Excellent. Until next time.
