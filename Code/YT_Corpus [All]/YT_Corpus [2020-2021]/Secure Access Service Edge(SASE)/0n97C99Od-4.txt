 from around the globe it's thecube with digital coverage of next level network experience event brought to you by infoblox okay welcome back everyone it's thecube's coverage and co-creation with infoblox next level networking event virtual event i'm john furrier your host of thecube we're here with craig sanderson vice president of security products at infoblox talk about securing the borderless enterprise obviously infoblox we had a variety of different conversations craig welcome to the cube thank you thanks great to be here remote cube normally we're in person but since it's covet 19 we're doing our best to get the stories out and the one things i want to chat with you is with kova 19 this shift to remote working is interesting and the word work is interesting you have workforces which are people work places which are locations which is now home work flows and work loads all work related right so if you think about the enterprise you know just the disruption to business model around this unforeseen hun almost 100 vpn usage maybe or or you got all this remote action no one could have saw seen all this coming how has this shift changed the security paradigm and posture for enterprises yeah i think for a lot of the customers that we talked to they've uh a lot of them have been thinking about digital transformation for some time what covert has really done is rapidly expanded or kind of accelerated the need for them to think about what the digital transformation plans are and unfortunately for some organizations who maybe not as far down the line as others they've looked at their current implementation for remote access and their traditional security models have like perimeter based and they found that you know in this current environment where suddenly you've gone from being only a partial set of your workforce who are remote to now all of them being remote and their applications their data their users they're all kind of spread anytime anyplace anywhere the traditional models doesn't really worked so what it's caused a lot of organizations to do is to really accelerate their digital transformation plans and quite often for some of those organizations they've realized that they've had to make the move relatively quickly because their traditional architectures have just not been designed for this level of of disruption the digital transformation has had on that on their businesses give some examples of how companies have either been flat-footed or on their heels kind of pushed back and saying wow we got caught off guard to ones that are kind of in place that kind of managed and managed the pandemic well what's the difference can you just give some color commentary around you know the the profile who got got it right or someone right and some that have gotten it wrong or are struggling so i think the ones who've got it right are the ones who are already thinking about digital transformation they're looking at the fact that a lot of the applications that their consumers or their users are consuming are increasingly going to be in the cloud anyway so the traditional architecture of all the good stuff's on the inside and the bad stuff on the outside that simply doesn't work with cloud and those organizations who are looking at obviously cloud deployments for their applications sd-wan iot those organizations have had to be thinking about how they're going to secure those devices the applications and users in a way that is going to be ubiquitous the fact that you can deploy the security controls wherever those applications users or devices are going to be so those organizations are already starting to think about how they can build a networking architecture that is going to be suited for digital transformation and by extension they've been recognizing that the security model has to change so for because they were much further down the path really this has been an acceleration for those organizations that well i'm not really interested in cloud i i'm worried about the risks associated with cloud and things like that who tended to try and stick or cling to the old traditional model where they've really run into trouble now is like this model just doesn't work and now the decisions almost been taken out of their hands with code because now the users are not on the corporate network they can't build a wall around those users they now have to provide protection for a user who's potentially not even using the device that they can control so for those organizations they're already thinking about cloud and sd-wan and iot because of that digital transformation effect they've been starting to think about security for those who've not thought about that who have been pushing that off they're the ones who've been caught somewhat flat-footed and now they're being forced to make a decision which maybe not necessarily feeling comfortable already ready to go off and do yeah craig i was talking to a friend the other day and we're like griffin on hey you know covert 19 really kind of exposes almost like the tide coming out as that tsunami comes you can see everything all the scabs and all the all the all the problems and then we started talking about the whole work at home situation like this is probably the biggest use case of iot in real life because you can really see it play out not just the factory or sensor or device at the edge of the network it's these are work people doing work right so this whole iot edge it's about addressability so you know i have to ask you because we've talked with you guys earlier in other segments around this next level networking experience i love the word experience but next level networking means next level so ddi has an abstraction ddi being dns dhcp and ip address management how does the security piece fit in because certainly yes you got at home got a bunch of iot people running their stuff from their home networks so remote access and you got also the business to run which includes everything that's connected to the network now and it literally is borderless so i like that term so how does ddi security fit into that yeah i mean as far as having the experience i mean one of the things that's changed i mean i've been in security over 20 years uh probably about 10 or 15 years ago as a security guy you could come back and you had a veto you'd come back and say well no we're not going to roll this thing out these applications or these services because it's a risk to the business now in a lot of the csos that i've talked to is that veto has gone away if this application is going to get rolled out we're going to run this service security has to catch up now what you can't have is from a seamless experience point of view is to say well okay you've now got a wonderful application experience but then it gets ruined by all the security controls are very invasive so what organizations are having to do is to think about how you can build a seamless networking architecture that can also seamlessly include the security as part of that and so you can still have the security of the organization needs without it becoming a massive disruption to the experience and one of the good examples is for a lot of organizations their remote access going back to the covered example is based on vpn vpns are cumbersome you know they have troubles with passwords and all these sort of traditional issues associated with the user experience from a vpn perspective i mean a lot of the users turn off the patients to do with that and they don't necessarily follow all the necessary security controls so people are being forced to rethink how they can build the quality application experience underpinned by a digitally transformed network but at the same time making sure you can layer in at a foundational layer the security functions as well and that's where a lot of organizations who are a little bit more forward thinking understood that and started to think about like dns as essentially this ubiquitous platform which is already there can already provide the sort of security services by default because going back to your example about iot uh one of the jokes with one of my friends is you know for every iot security officer every iot offering there's a separate iot security offering and one of the things that was a light bulb moment for us is if you're trying to secure all these heterogeneous iot devices well one thing they have in common they're all going to get an ip address so we're going to use dns so what people have to start to do is to try and make security seamless it has to be built into the foundations it can't be this extra thing that you kind of glob on the side because it then ruins the overall experience for the users the nice thing about dns is it's ubiquitous and you can apply the security regardless of what the endpoint of the application is because the common denominator is they get an ip address and they use dns and dns has such a great track record over the years of having layers of abstractions on top of it to pace with the functionality and it's really been an operating model and you bring up the different security packages and postures for each thing and you mentioned you know the old days the security guy oh no we're killing that no we're going this way yeah that was the operational model but now with devops you brought up cloud earlier devops has proven that agility speed scale can work and how does security catch up it's an operating model so this is really kind of the key epiphany is hey vpns that's not the experience that people want and you know just talking to someone from amazon this morning on another interview segment and the and the discussion was new expectations new solutions so that's kind of what we're seeing right now so how do you enable that out at speed by not screwing over the operations people right so because they got to be operational people need to be really rock solid so you need automation you got to have those factors and requirements built in but you got the the agility for development here yeah yeah absolutely i mean we see that especially as one of the things about because dna is essentially ubiquitous you can apply similar security controls regardless of the environment so right now i'm stuck at home because of because of the covert virus so again i'm going to use dns i go through one of our cloud platforms i have dns applying the security controls there but within the same thing because dns works as one ubiquitous system and it's like how the internet works with dns is that quite easily not only can you block malicious threats for myself but also you can push that same block mitigation to a dns service running in aws so for your workload that may also have been compromised trying to go to the same malicious domain it can also be blocked by dns and so that ubiquity the fact is built as this ubiquitous system i mean one thing is very different in the networking world standards are great you can plug different things together they all kind of fit together nicely in security it's not normally that not normally the case it's normally you've got this jigsaw puzzle but all the pieces don't really fit together the nice thing with dns is is absolutely ubiquitous so one basic example is if i try to go to a malicious domain and i try to steal data over dns not only would we be able to block it but we'd also be able to dynamically share that mitigation to all the on-prem dns servers the dns servers you've rather run in your public or private cloud and for all the other like remote users so the fact you've got this pre-built fabric and it's not that we're security geniuses it's just it happens to already be there because of of dns and how dns has been developed over the last 30 or 40 years so i think the nice thing about it a lot of organizations are starting to realize that you've got this foundation already there ostensibly it's there for networking purposes but the ability to repurpose all the core assets of dns the scalability the flexibility the adaptability the ubiquity all those things are there by default why don't you use that as the new foundation for that next-gen security architecture and you know you got me as a fan i'll say that right away because you're thinking about the simplicity of going to the low-level building block in dns it fits for what i said earlier the future of work the word work work place work force work load workflows no matter what it is it works across so it's a consistent primitive i mean it makes total sense why would you want to have different things so again this brings up the whole foundational level of ddi that's got my interest and i want you to explain this for folks because i think it's not obvious abstractions are pretty clear people get abstraction layers reduce complexity and increase functionality and capability but ddi you guys have from a foundational security standpoint is kind of the unique thing infoblox says how is that different ddi from other offerings in the security stack yeah i think the one thing that's probably uh unique especially when it comes to dns is the fact it's built together this ubiquitous system and it's there by default i mean otherwise the internet just wouldn't work so the nice thing is is that uh if you deploy a dns system here we deploy as a grid so whether it's the an appliance running on prem or sitting in a public cloud or even for roman users who are going through one of our points of presence it works as one big ubiquitous system whereas you take like traditional firewalls you're configuring these devices separately and you have to manually stitch it together and you take multiple different vendors and you know it doesn't quite fit neatly together dns is based on the standard you could take a dns server from a master dns server from another company and because it's based on standards it will work seamlessly together in fact the threat mitigation mechanism where you distribute threat intelligence to tell the dns what is the malicious domains of ip addresses to block is based on something called response policy zones that's been part of the dns standard since 2010 and it works seamlessly across multiple vendors whereas in the security world as i said it's kind of like a jigsaw where you get all the pieces together that you think you need and then the burden is always on the customer or the organization to then piece these things together and it's a jigsaw it doesn't fit together i have seen that burden because it was a hell of a lot of issues for a lot of the customers yeah i got to ask you since dns is so foundational it's an element in all internet activities obviously you know urls is dns string actually so everything's based on dns how it resolves so what what about the um how would you respond if someone said hey you know i don't even know dns is still around i know it's palm it's underneath there somewhere i don't even have to deal with it just runs things we've been using it for years what's the big deal so how do you go in and say hey customer hey enterprise you're now borderless i get the pitch but they have dns um how do they modernize it how do they assess it how do you go in some the young kids don't even know what dns might even is i mean like like yeah so like what what do you go in what how do you approach that and what's the pitch because they got it and it's an opportunity to innovate what's the what's the story there there's really two aspects to it the first one i mean dns is a bit like oxygen if it's not there you really do notice it um you just take when that when we had the uh uh the mirror botnet attack a few years back all these organizations suddenly realize how important dns is and there's a reason why dns is the number one attack vector for for ddos attacks if i'm an adversary i could try and take out individual applications it's gonna take me forever i take out your dns everything's gonna stop i mean it's that i thought it was just hackers no problem yeah yeah right exactly so and for for that reason that's why it's constantly targeted so firstly my first pitch to customers is you got to take this stuff seriously because when it goes down everything is down and the impact to your organization not just from a brand reputation but just from running your business it's going to be huge but on top of that the way to think of dns is the nice thing is is you don't have to change your network architecture if you think about a typical user who clicks on a phishing link when they click on the phishing link who's going to see the malicious request first is it your firewall no your dns server because you make the request you have to resolve the malicious domain that you're going to try and connect you need to find out the ip address of it so your dns server has been proven multiple studies that the vast majority of malware uses dns as its control plane so if you want to understand what the bad guys are doing you know your dns server's got a front row seat to exactly what the bad guys are doing and to implement security on it is you don't have to change your network architecture because your tns is already there by default all you need to do is infuse it with security knowledge whether that is machine learning analytics or threat intelligence but those dns servers are ideally positioned they're going to see the malicious activity regardless of what the what the application is so it's foundational not just in terms of if it's not there it's going to cause a massive issue for your environment anyway but even if you secure the dns the dns is also this wonderful tool that is in all the right places and it's also deeper into the network one of the challenges you mentioned about operations is um the challenge is okay you can block malware but if you don't know the source address of the device that is actually trying to make the request you don't know what to go and clean up whereas your dns server your dhcp server knows exactly who it is because we handed out the ip address we know the mac address we know the ip address we know the user name we have all that information that's going to be critical for security operations and and now you can see what we're talking about maybe the forester report you'll start to see that organizations are waking up to the fact that you have this treasure trove of security operations data that you haven't tapped largely for political reasons because the security guys can't reach over and grab the necessary ddi network context from those dns platforms because typically they're owned by the networking or the server team before we get into that forest reports i think that and had some threat investigation data what you're getting at about this dns is that basically it's critical infrastructure and if you try to forget about it because it works you lose sight of the real opportunity which is if it's critical infrastructure you've got to treat it like critical infrastructure and make sure it's modernized refreshed in the right position to manage all this right absolutely absolutely yeah it's uh unfortunately with the with the uh the murrow botnet attack a lot of organizations they say well okay we'll just outsource this we don't have to worry about it but when it wasn't there and it wasn't the fact that i mean it was an attempt to take out like minecraft as servers nothing to do with most of the businesses were impacted but there was a lot of collateral damage and unfortunately it's like one of those things is because dns is a victim of its own success the fact it is reliable it is consistent you don't have lots of dns outages typically as a result of that people tend to forget about how critical it is the role it plays in serving all of your applications or your users let's get into the forest report because they surveyed a bunch hundreds of security and risk management leaders both compliance and also security pros that are using dns what were your what were your key thoughts on the takeaways from that study what should people know about it it's very encouraging as i've been in infobox about five years when i first joined the usage of dns as a network context as a way to help with security operations was very very low and that causes all sorts of issues for organizations when it comes to doing security operations i mean a prime example is uh the guys who work in security operations that is the biggest issue for customers right now they've bought almost too much security gear and each of those security uh tools and platforms they're generating security events so you're getting security events from your firewall from your ips or from your next system or whatever it happens to be and the burden now falls on the security operations teams and it's been proven that there's huge amounts of open opportunities because it just isn't enough trained security operation staff and the ones who are already in the business are massively overworked and struggled to get through all the security events that are being firing from those security operations tools so for what i was encouraging from the forest to report is organizations are realizing that dhcp is going to help you be able to identify the fact that these two security events seem completely separate one's got a source address of 10.1 the other one's 20.1 well you know what this laptop moved from one side of the building to the other and got a different address it's actually the same device but based on the traditional security events you're getting from the existing tools you know you're going to think it's two separate events and they're not likewise one of the things that's come out is that people are starting to use dns as an audit trail i mean one of the challenges for organizations is if you get a data breach what's one of the first questions a journalist is going to ask you is that well what is the scope of the breach what was impacted and quite often organizations are not prepared they come back and say well at this stage we don't know that's a great way for a ceo or a cso to get fired so a smarter way of doing it is if you think about you've got a device that's under investigation the dns queries that those map machines been making is a wonderful audit trail of not just the external resources it's been accessing but also the internal resources as well what has been potentially exposed so i think from the forester report we're certainly seeing people realizing where their biggest challenge is security operations essentially the ddi data is almost like the oil is going to grease the wheels of security operations and if you don't do that buying more security gear is not going to make the problem better it's actually going to make it worse unless you can operationalize it yeah at the end of the day the failures right there in the low level critical infrastructure you know building falls no one cares what happened on the 10th floor foundation's gone i got to get your thoughts on this because as you guys have ddi it's abstraction dns you know as it's grown has it's had its evolutions with abstractions you know as these things kind of flex it used to be an old expression dns tricks you know you would mangle dns and it was a naming system so you use it the way you use it and and then new innovation layers uh create more upside and more takes away complexities how does dns scale and enable value because now you've got cloud you got cloud native new software's being written and developers want to rely on the dns's critical infrastructure but also want to be enabled to have you know really robust applications yeah i think with uh given the fact that all the work has been put into dns over the last 20 or 30 years what this result is a very highly available very very resilient system and so a lot of stuff has to go wrong for dns to fully go down and if you if it's even just take things like anycast anycast allows you to connect to the nearest dns server that's going to give you the resolution so it's going to give you the best performance this also can you give you the high availability and resilience that goes along with that and i think also from the security guy's point of view as if um one of the things that we've started to realize is that dns is a great avenue for which you can detect somewhat unique threats so one of the things that comes up quite a lot we started to see old malware being re-weaponized to extract data over dns so if i've if you're a devops guy and you're you're building your new application if someone compromises your application if i try to extract the data over http or email you probably have a solution for that but how many organizations have visibility in the billions of dns queries that's going to come out of your network in a day which ones of those might be actually data that has been stolen it gets encoded encrypted chopped up and sent out in dns packets it's very difficult for traditional security appliances to understand and really differentiate between legitimate dns requests the malicious ones and actually the ones who are benign applications are essentially tunnel over dns because they're trying to bypass firewall rules so increasingly dns is a threat factor for basic data loss it's also important to understand is really gives you a window into what the adversaries are doing so not just when it comes to data exfiltration but other things like the main generated algorithms allow adversaries to main contain control of devices that they compromise so a lot of that stuff is not just about the high availability and the ubiquity of dns but also making sure you can uh be fully on top of the potential impact of dns being exploited as a potential backdoor out of your network critical infrastructure but also that's where you're going to see the footprints of any kind of activity right there it's a great observation space as well for detection and analysis great stuff craig thank you for taking the time great insight great conversation uh dns it's a critical infrastructure get on it and people aren't on it they're gonna not go the next level getting the next level networking experience is about having that security always on high availability and protecting the bad guys craig thanks for for joining me on this cube conversation for the infoblox virtual event thank you great pleasure thanks for having me okay that's thecube coverage of infoblox's next level networking virtual event i'm john furrier host of thecube thanks for watching [Music]
