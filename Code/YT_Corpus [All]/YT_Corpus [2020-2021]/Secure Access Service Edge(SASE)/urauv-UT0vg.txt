 hey guys thanks for tuning in najkasi here today being a world mental health day i wanted to take a moment to talk about a very important issue typically we ask others how they're doing whether or not they're happy but how often do we ask ourselves that question probably never i think it's critical that we take a step back and evaluate whether or not we're happy and what does being happy mean it doesn't mean having a big smile on your face all the time or being in a constant state of bliss in my opinion it's about being at peace at heart and having your mind at peace i think that's the key and i'm gonna share a couple of tips with you today to help you achieve just that tip number one meditate every morning take a few seconds out early in the morning before you do anything express your gratitude for a couple of minutes in the morning to the almighty about all of your achievements the family members in your life all the loved ones in your life your co-workers the job that you have the business that you're running all those things and what that will do is start off your day on a very positive note and kind of put you at ease and will make you grounded tip number two create a daily priority list if you're supposed to make a call to the customer or follow up with a coworker write those tasks down whatever it might be write those things down maybe get a daily journal right it doesn't have to be anything fancy you can grab a piece of paper and do it what that does is make you priority focused so every day you're focused on the most highest impactful things in your life and tip number three and this is the key one guys is track your daily wins doesn't matter how small a victory is if victory is a victory if once you make a habit of writing this down every day this third tip will help you become a very positive minded person and over time it's going to transform you if you focus on all three tips on daily basis for over 90 days it's scientifically proven that you will create a habit and once you create this habit it will turn you into a productivity monster i promise you i've been implementing these techniques for many many years and i'm an entrepreneur an engineer i have a nine to five and i'm also a youtuber right so i'm able to do all these tasks with 100 focus because i'm able to use these three tips and tricks that i shared with you to keep me focused to keep me grounded and to keep me positive so i can keep moving forward thank you for watching think and reflect with naj and i'll see you in the next video
