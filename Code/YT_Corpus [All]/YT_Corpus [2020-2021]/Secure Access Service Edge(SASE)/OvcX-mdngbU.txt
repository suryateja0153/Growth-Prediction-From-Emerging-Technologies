 Narrator: We live in a connected world that allows us to work anytime anywhere. While productivity is at an all-time high, hackers now have an ever expanding attack surface to exploit. McAfee's Unified Cloud Edge protects enterprise data and defense from threat where modern work gets done on the device, in the cloud, and in between. Unified Cloud Edge provides customers with a single place to set up security policies that are then enforced uniformly across the entire cloud surface and any device with converging capabilities that were previously found in disparate platforms: CASB, Secure Web Gateway, and DLP. Let's take a closer look. Protect data wherever it lives or moves, on the device, in the cloud, and in between. With one click, manage incident reporting and start an investigation case, all from one location. Apply threat prevention, content inspection, and web filtering from a single pane of glass view. And give users speed and safety in one experience with a superior web peering architecture that supports the latest internet technologies. McAfee's Unified Cloud Edge, security as seamless as work. It's about time. To learn more or schedule a free demo, please visit us online today. (fun upbeat music)
