 You know at Silver Peak when we think about SD-WAN, rather than thinking of as software-defined WAN which is really the canonical expansion of the acronym I think it's much more helpful to think of the SD of Self-Driving. Self-Driving WAN and really what we are doing at Silver Peak is turning upside down the way that networks have been built in the past if you think about the traditional router based MPLS network and you have seen a few hundred locations, you're going to a few hundred devices and at each of those devices you'll take typing a few thousand lines of command-line interface very complicated language turning on/off micro features, tweaking parameters and hopefully, if you get all those lines right at every site, what will happen is that network will do what your business needs, and so what we've done at Silver Peak is turn that problem upside down and said what about instead of trying to capture what the devices should be doing, why don't we go and focus on the business problem and capture that information. So for each group of applications we want to know how should these applications be treated from an uptime or reliability point of view, how should they be treated from a quality of service or user experience point of view, how should they be treated from a security point of view, do we want to keep this traffic segmented for instance point-of-sale traffic separate than HVAC traffic. Do we want this traffic to be routed direct to the internet or do we want a backhaul via the data center, do we want to go to a cloud security service. So just asking those simple kind of business questions for each group of apps, we effectively build a a goal for the network and then we use that goal or outcome to drive our automation and so it's not automation that's just about installing things and getting things up and running quickly the beginning, it's about continuously adapting what we're doing to make sure that the network's delivering on those high-level goals and so that's really what Silver Peak SD-WAN is all about and obviously to do that there are many ingredients that go into it. So there's what people would classes automation but in order to implement the continuous kind of adaptation there's a lot we do that fits them to the machine learning market and you know much like self-driving cards there's an evolution and so some of the things we do would be akin to say lane-keeping where you're steering a car but staying in a lane it's a subsystem that's affecting the steering, you know another kind of sub system in a soft driving car might be the the the learning and the algorithms that are making sure that the battery life is extended as long as possible by spreading load across the entire battery pack over time and so if you look at a soft driving car today there's lots of subsystems that they use that are intelligence in and of themselves and you'll find that in our solution. We have many many subsystems and implemented these learning algorithms to deliver on this promise of self-driving. You know at the same time just like with self-driving cars, it's, we're not all the way there yet, it's a very high bar to get to complete self-driving car, it's a very high bar to get to complete self driving WAN and so it's really you know an exciting challenge for us at Silver Peak to continue to innovate, continue to look at new machine learning and AI techniques and look at how we can leverage those to extend the level of our automation to get closer and closer to that goal of fully self-driving.
