 [Music] good morning everybody welcome to SCC 202 prevention detection response to threats with cloud security command center I'm Andy Chang one of the product managers on Google's cloud security team hi I'm Kyle all of them another one of the product managers working with Andy and Tim and I'm Tim peacock I'm another one of the product managers whose voice is incredibly loud and so Kyle and Tim will come back on the stage to talk about their particular parts but let's kick us off also as you know there is a app for the next sessions please do rate us if you like our talks and rate us if you don't like our talks so we're going to talk today about the cloud supreme command center will again talk about threat prevention detection and response the partner integrations to allow us to meet you where you are and allow you to use the existing products you have in conjunction integrate with command center we'll be showing you an end-to-end demo of how you can detect respond to and act on the security threats that you see either from vulnerabilities or from threat detection talk a little bit about getting started and then if we have time take some questions so as you as customers move from your private installations to public cloud typically what we hear are three major concerns the first is really that change in visibility and control you see from what you have when you're an on-premise - when you're in the public cloud and that concern that you won't have the same ability to really take the responsibilities and take charge of your systems secondly and related to that is we hear a strong concern about the inability for you to detect and respond to the threats that you see in your systems at the same rate with the same kind of detailed granularity that you have in the past and lastly as you add and grow into public cloud rely on new systems new controls new things to learn and that inconsistency between what you're used to and what's running in public cloud also creates opportunities for miss configurations for items that are set up incorrectly which introduces opportunities for breaches because of these kind of main concerns we've really focused on creating the cloud security command center give you one central place across your organization to look at what's going on what assets you have what types of data you have the vulnerabilities they're tected the miss configurations and the ability to detect bad actors doing bad things through live threat detection in addition we focused on allowing you to figure out different ways to respond to those threats that have been infected either through direct notifications or through the ability to connect them to cloud functions to take action today we're going to talk a little bit more about how great command center and help you in all these different aspects so as an overview the cloud supreme commander is really focused on prevention of threats so that's the ability to look at what's happening in your infrastructure to find some of the most common things that go wrong from a misconfigurations standpoint and also to look at applications running on your infrastructure so you look at vulnerabilities and weaknesses those applications once we've helped you get to a better security state and have a good understanding of your posture we then look to see to help you find what's activity bad actor activity happening on your systems through a couple different systems that Tim will talk about and lastly through a notification notifications pub/sub and the ability to leverage cloud functions and also our ability to let you export your data to the sim of choice we allow you to now respond to those threats where you most likely want to and with the manner you would like so with that I'm going to turn it over to Kyle who's going to talk to you about security health analytics hi everybody as I said I'm Kyle olive I'm one of the product managers working with Tim and Andy on cloud security command center and I focus on the products and security command centers that are designed to help you understand and improve your security posture so that you can prevent threats before they happen I'm gonna talk a little bit today about security health analytics and web security scanner so we've seen a lot of different breaches in the news and one of the things that a lot of these breaches have in common is that there are the cause directly or indirectly by misconfigurations in either the infrastructure or the applications that are running on the cloud so we've designed security command center to help you get a handle on what you have running on the cloud and to understand where you can improve so that you can prevent these threats from happening in the first place so as I said security command center is designed to give you a single organizational level view of the resources and assets you have deployed into GCP you can see all the different resources that have been deployed broken down by asset type and you can identify the changes that have been made in those resources over time additionally with products like security health analytics you can also get insights into how these are configured to identify where you can close security holes and improve your security to prevent these threats from happening to begin with so let's talk a little bit about security health analytics security health analytics is now in a beta insecurity command center so you can go in there now turn it on and start getting these insights for your GCP deployment so we have over 65 different detectors available in security health analytics these detectors will have will generate findings that will show up in security command centers individual findings and also on a vulnerabilities dashboard we'll see more about this dashboard in a demo later on but the dashboard gives you a single place to review your overall security posture either at an organizational level or filtered down by individual projects you can also filter sort and search through this table by severity of the finding by the benchmark number in the center for internet security DCP benchmarks or by any particular information you're looking for so this really gives you a good starting point to figure out what should you focus on so that you can improve the security of your deployment additionally every single finding that is of that security health analytics generates has information about the security impact of that finding how to remediate it as well as quick links and steps so that you can go directly from the finding into the right place into the GCP console where you can close that issue and that will kind of give you the understanding of what is this issue how do I resolve it how do I operate this so that these issues don't become a systemic problem in my department so talking a little bit more about the different types of detectors we have available in security health analytics up on this slide here you see a small number of the detectors we have available again if you want to see the full list of all 65 detectors please review our documentation on the DCP documentation you'll see the full list there but our goal with these detectors is to span the whole set of different resource types that are available in DCP and to offer a very strong baseline level of insight into how secure are you so we have detectors available for storage for example we look at whether you have publicly accessible storage buckets that maybe you didn't mean to be public we look at things like networking to understand you have overly permissive firewalls do you have ports open that you shouldn't have open we look at your instances VM instances as well as GK to understand if you have things configured in a way that are either using legacy controls or overly permissive or have other security issues and then of course we have a suite of logging and monitoring recommendations to help you understand are there places where you should improve what you're logging and monitoring so that an issue so that if an issue does happen you can figure out what happened and stop it from happening in the future and I do want to touch on one thing is that the detectors we've built we've worked very closely with the Center for Internet security to certify these detectors against the GCP foundation benchmark there so this is a so you can use this as a baseline of security against the CIS benchmarks to understand how you're doing and track that over time so how does it work as I said earlier cloud security command center already takes all of your asset information and gives you one place to review it it also contains a lot of the metadata about those assets and how they're configured so security health analytics runs on top to perform analytics and processing of that data and mash it against a set of rules to detectives that we've written in order to identify these misconfigurations when something is found actual recommendations are generated as findings in the CSC security command center so that you can review those later okay so securing your infrastructure and making sure that you have a good baseline level of security in terms of configurations is a really really powerful first step to securing your deployment to the cloud but that's only part of the problem the other problem is the applications and workloads you run on GCP how do you make sure those are secure and they don't have latent vulnerabilities that a malicious actor can take advantage of well we have the web security scanner so web security scanner or cloud security scanner is a web application vulnerability scanner scanning tool so with this tool we detect things like Ross that scripting vulnerabilities we detect vulnerable resources like accessible git repos that weren't meant to be accessible and we also look at application misconfigurations do you have the right security headers are they correct Lee configured and will let you know where there are things that application team should go to take a look at in order to resolve one of the things I want to call out with the web security scanner is that these are the very same detection that Google uses ourselves to scan and secure our own web applications so you're able to use the same technology that we use internally to protect your applications on GCP so web security scanner works a little bit differently than security health analytics does security health analytics you just have to turn on and it will just start running in the background based off of the asset information that you have in security command center web security scanner you have to go in and configure each individual scan so you go to web security scanner you'd say I want to configure a new scan and you tell the scanner where your application is give it a starting URL you also have the control to give it the URLs where it shouldn't go so if there are parts of your application you don't want Google to scan with the web security scanner you can give that to us and we won't scan those places once you've set that out you can then run the scan or schedule the scan to run on a periodic basis so if you have a continuous deployment you can schedule the scan to run on a periodic basis to also have updates and we'll crawl through your web application and try to exercise links and submit forms and click on URLs to try to find real exploitable vulnerabilities when those are found we register those into security command center one of the things that we're really happy with with web security scanner is the the high signal rate that we have with our findings because our scanner actually exploits in a safe way the vulnerabilities on your websites we know that anything we generate in into security command center is the legitimate finding that you should take action on we're also constantly improving the web security scanner I have a couple of updates that I'd like to share that will be available in alpha next month that give you more control over how the security scanner runs and how it has access to your applications the first is support for scanning from static IPS so now you can set up your scans with security scanner to run from a source range of static IP is that you know about so you can set up firewall rules to give it access to applications that it may not have been able to access before additionally we're expanding and improving our support for authentication and security scanner you'll now be able to use a ap identity where proxy support service accounts with web security scanner to gain access to eiope protected applications and scan those as well so if you're interested in those alphas please keep an eye out next month and contact a Google contact to get into the Alpha Group all right so now I'm gonna hand it over to Tim who's going to talk to you more about the other part of what we do in security command center in terms of active threats Kyle and a thank you so much for bringing me up I know that we all make investments every day in keeping our infrastructure applications and users secure despite that we continue to get owned and so what we've built into security command center with cloud anomaly detection and now event threat detection in a public beta our tools to help identify when things have gone wrong despite all of our investments so with these two products we've started down the path of building a comprehensive suite of detection for threats that are active in your environment with cloud anomaly detection we're surfacing some of the findings that are internal abuse tooling produces to help keep Google secure to help let you know as soon as we can about bad things with event threat detection we've gone a step further and we've built an externalize diversion of the internal logs processing pipeline that Google uses to protect itself to help protect you in cloud so internally Google protects itself by analyzing the entire corpus of Google log data petabytes a day at the top end of the funnel what fewer than a gigabyte a day of finding is the bottom end of the funnel massive compression of the logs into high-quality findings for our internal teams we're doing the same thing in cloud with event threat detection so not only are we a ping how we detect the threats we're using the same threat intelligence that we use to protect Google to protect you so I'll talk about that in a second but I want to talk about now are the threats that we're looking for so in cloud the threat landscape looks a little bit different than it does on Prem and so in the cloud there are some things you may recognize malware phishing use of resources to commit outgoing DDoS but some of these are more prevalent and more powerful in cloud some of these are relatively novel like crypto mining detection and some of these are entirely novel like malicious i''m grants and so between the two products we're covering this entire beautiful slide of beautiful icons to help you understand what threats were looking for and we're really delighted about not only the the coverage but the quality of these findings and I want to take a second here because I see some of you in the audience to thank my beta users for all of the good feedback about the finding quality and where we were going wrong with the finding contents during the private beta so thank you to the beta users we really appreciate all the beta users here at Google I really appreciate mine so ETD is the product that I'm responsible for it's the thing I'm most excited about like I said it's inspired by how we protect ourselves and it's powered with the same threat intelligence so internally we have a team of very talented security engineers who with googles attack surface and visibility into things used to attack people they've produced some pretty powerful signals about not just you know criminal enterprise activity but also nation-state activity we've been the target of nation-state attacks for many years we've been the target of you know every level of sophistication during that era and so we've developed a very robust pipeline for analyzing samples identifying indicators of compromise and we're using those same i/o C's that we used to protect ourselves to protect you in cloud we're also very proud of fact that we're running very close to real-time and you'll see that during the demo if everything goes well that we're able to do that so under the covers how does ETD well the the schematic diagram for how ETV works is we think of it as step one produce the logs and so today we're analyzing cloud audit logs which are the platform logs produced by default they can't be turned off they're ingested into stack driver this is what you can think of as the base layer of infrastructure logging change is made your DCP environment by your users service accounts by Google itself we also move up the stack into analyzing Network logs so all of the traditional security folks in the room will be very familiar with analyzing both flow logs and DNS logs looking for indicators of compromise whether accesses to bad IP addresses access to known bad domains we also removing up the stack one more time into analyzing syslog so it's very easy to setup your GC instances using the fluent D agent to take logs off of what you're running put them into stack driver and let us analyze them for threat detection logs are ingested into ETD out of stack driver cloud logging sack driver cloud logging is the place for log aggregation and analysis in GCP we have a private interconnect with them so you turn us on those logs start flowing that's all the stuff that's required we process them like I said using Google's own threat intelligence as well as our threat detection logic that we've developed as the ETD team and finally we rate those findings out for you into two places the primary one being Security Command Center from security command center you can take advantage of pub/sub to pull these findings into where you want or take action on them automatically or with a human in the loop with cloud functions under the covers it looks a little bit more like this you can think of this as a produce centralized analyze respond lifecycle so on the left hand side producing the logs at the top of the stack again the compute logs today we're analyzing syslog to look for SSH brute force we're analyzing GP g CP network logs to look for accesses to known bad IP addresses for malware crypto mining phishing detection same thing for domains we're also using the sizing and other properties of the flow logs to look for outgoing denial service attacks and finally analyzing the platform audit logs today this powers are anomalous I am detection in the future there's a whole host of things that we can identify with the platform logging again centralized in stackdriver it gives you the user an opportunity both to do your own log analysis as well as sync those logs out to things other services like bigquery GCS or oft your on-prem some ETD analyzes them and we pumped them at your Cloud Security Command Center from there using the pub sub setup you can hook them into bigquery for long term archive and analysis GCS for long term archive or even off to Splunk or your other on-premise em I know there are other ones lots of users you spunk you can also consume them into cloud functions I'll talk a little bit about that during the demo so I'm gonna bring Andy back up to talk about responding to threats thanks Tim so as both Kyle and Tim have talked about we've now given you one central place in your organization to look at your assets importantly the vulnerabilities and threats the visibility and the detection parts the last piece is to help accelerate your ability to respond to that and there are really three things that we end up focusing on one where just as we're really excited to announce the public beta of both security health analytics and event threat detection we're now in alpha for the built-in pub/sub notification channel within the cloud security command center which allows you to define a triggering filter to pick the events that you want to trigger on you define the topic and then connect that topic and have multiple subscribers whether there are workflow systems web hooks or cloud functions as Tim talked about to take action connected with that last piece is our ability to actually provide a set of cloud functions out-of-the-box for you to now use to take response actions things that will close firewalls or change the permissions on buckets or do additional enrichment on your data and lastly as we alluded to we recognize that we work in your ecosystem so in addition to having the data centralized in the cloud secure command sir ability for you to export that a to the sim of your choice in terms of responding to threats the Alpha notifications alpha that we've launched allows you to create a notification config in that config you specify the specific query that you want to generate pub/sub events and also the topic that you want to attach that to from that point on you can then have that topic subscribed to by other projects cloud functions users web hooks other systems and we'll show some of the integrations that we have built in and then you can leverage those cloud functions as we said to take action and our approach currently is to then make those cloud functions available to a github repository so not only are we contributing to those cloud functions but you as a community can also add the temp response actions or remediation actions that you want into that cloud function library another important part of meeting you where you are is recognizing - you already have built trust and used a lot of existing security products and what we've done with the cloud straight command center is make it easy for you to integrate those security products have their detections and findings as well unified and normalized in one place in the clouds of trade command center so that you truly you have one organization level view of all the security inspections assets the data types that are running on your DCP installation and therefore you truly have a good view of what your security posture is we have built in integrations either through pub/sub or through sidecar applications to add to you directly into Splunk and really you can take a look at our marketplace to see the rich set of folks that we have integrated to talk a little bit more about that overall integration the way we are thinking about how the clouds man Center works in the ecosystem is both first to take the built-in finding sources and detectives that we have in Google cloud around security and there'll be an increasing set of these as well as third-party partners and their strong detections allow those to come together in one place we're excited to announce along with the cloud armor GA the integration of the cloud armors detections into the cloud security command center so this allows us in combination with the pub/sub out to provide you more options of how you build all this together in one place with that what we want to now show you is an end-to-end view of how you can use cloud security command center actually both detect those threats that are happening looking phoner abilities and actually respond to them in one specific use case so I'd like to bring Tim back up on the stage to actually run the demo thank you Andy so it's 2019 and I still have users and Googlers every day getting compromised by SSH brute force so I thought it might be interesting to run a little attack here against the fluffy cloud retail company they are getting ready for the holiday season and some bad actor out there is scanning the internet looking for open port 22 and trying to login to their resources and it turns out that despite this being 2019 and all the investments we make this still happens pretty regularly and we've built a detector to pick this up when it happens by analyzing your syslog and so you might imagine that here we have the fluffy cloud retail company hanging out getting ready for the holidays when the bad thing happens oh don't you guys hate it when your phone rings during a presentation its pager duty though so I better answer it you have three triggers and events on GCP security services that sounds bad press for two at knowledge hall and to them you better go see what that is so let's pop over to security command center and see what's going on so I've navigated off the home page into the finding list view I'm just gonna refresh the findings to right now and so we can look at event threat detection and see right here that we have a finding discovered just now of that SSH brute force on that resource and so we can pop down and see some of the see some of the attributes that ETD is making available for users when investigating this kind of threat so what you saw there was in very close to real-time an SSH brute-force attack detected and pulled all the way back through to pager duty and then ringing my us phone number over the Wi-Fi and a lot of that delay there was my phone not the finding so we can pop into this and have a look we can see which user on the asset was compromised where the logins were coming from which will give your security team when they're spying with us a clue about whether that's somebody inside the network fat fingering things or whether that's somebody in an unwanted location accessing your resources and other information about the logs that were involved in generating this finding and so this is pretty cool it's fun to have real-time detection but be even better if we had had some kind of preventive control to help our security team or a compliance team keep these attacks from happening in the first place so as cool as it is to detect stuff I want to bring Kyle up to talk about how we would identify this kind of weakness proactively and help your compliance team find it before the bad thing happened so something bad happened and that's not good so how do we make sure that this that this badness doesn't happen again or that and that we're secure across our other projects so that this brute force or other attacks like it doesn't happen against my fluffy cloud retail company so let me take a look at the vulnerabilities tab and look at the dashboard for my org so I can see here as as Tim mentioned this scroll bar is not working I still mention you can see all the different findings available for security health analytics additionally I can filter this table to look at specific findings so in this case after this attack I know that there was an open port so I'll probably want to take a look at how many other open firewalls exist in my organization so I can look at recommendation or category I can look at open open SSH port and that should show me that I have five different active vulnerabilities we're open SSH ports exist now that's great across my whole organization but I may also want to understand which projects are the biggest violators of this particular recommendation so I can go to the project filter and choose specific findings so let's say I want to look at my my main project here which happens to be called victim and I can see that in the victim project there actually was one VM with which had an open SSH port one firewall rule which had an open SSH port and so I know that if I go to fix that this particular attack probably won't happen again there's also a bunch of different ways I can filter and pivot this dashboard to get the information I want if I have a customer that uses or or if I myself use the CIS benchmarks to understand my my security posture I can also look at a specific benchmark number like for example C is one point one in this case this scanner hasn't run so it's okay but I can look at for example see is 3.7 so if I go to benchmarks 3.7 I can see that again there's also an open art RDP port with that benchmark so lots of different ways to filter and pivot and sort this view based on what I'm trying to answer as a as an analyst so the last thing is let's say I have figured out that I want to solve these open SSH port issues so I can go again and find that particular SSH port issue that that this attack happened on so if I choose victim that will come up again and I can actually click through on this finding to pivot over to the findings page this will pre-filter that findings page which helps a lot if you have thousands of thousands of findings across tens of thousands of resources this helped to kind of filter down to a particular find it can then open that finding info and there's gonna be a lot of really useful information here as I said it tells me at the very top this is a high severity finding so we know that this finding if you if you leave this open and it's it's compromised it's gonna probably be a big issue so we also give you more information about what this finding is actually about so here we tell you that port 22 is open which may expose the SSH port that SSH instance to attackers and then finally we have specific remediation instructions for this specific issue that you can then click through and immediately go and solve that problem so if I click on configure asset it will jump me to another tab where all I have to do is finish reconfiguring it and then the issue is gone so through all of this stuff through event threat detection you can get a handle on what's going on right now what attacks are happening right now and understanding the impact in the scope of those attacks and then you can pivot from there as a ongoing security in hygiene perspective to figure out where you can fix issues and make sure those attacks don't happen again and so that's the end of our demo I'm gonna invite Andy back up to wrap up our presentation Thank You Kyle so well we've talked to you about today as a cloud security command center has that single pane of glass that single data platform for you to bring the vulnerability and detection information the asset information the current security posture in one place on your system we have to announce the public beta for the event threat detection public beta through security health analytics and alpha for the notifications so we're hoping that this combination of capabilities now in your hands will help you be much better about identifying and understanding what your security posture is and what the attacks surface you have security command center as previously has been no change in pricing the only times you're charged in this pretty command center is if you upload more than a gigabyte a day of external third-party findings in the cloud security commencer in addition some of the Google built in products like cloud DLP and cloud armor have suffered and vigil charges their integration into the cloud supreme command center is free but offering those services themselves generate charges if you're using a vent threat detection we charge you 25 cents per gigabyte of the log data we process to detect threats on and then stay tuned we're taking with the security command center event threat section and a number of all of these built-in security products and bundling them together in the future as a cloud scree command center premium edition to get started today there are three really easy steps first from marketplace enable the cloud security command center it's generally available you'll find it at marketplace as long as you have an organization you can go to marketplace turn it on number to view the cloud spree command center Quick Start enabled the variants different detectors security health analytics try out event threat detection sign up for the notifications alpha and then learn how to use the cloud Safari commencer we've done a five series video blog that shows the different things you want to do to get started check that out and so we're hoping then that you'll be as excited as us that the cloud squared command so it gives you one place for you to look at what's running on Google cloud platform for you and see the centralized view of your security posture with that I'd like to bring both Tim and Kyle back up and we'll take a few questions I think there are mics out on the floor or mic runners so if you have questions don't be shy oh thanks guys that's really sweet thank you Hey hey guys good morning my question would be if we have seen we can prevent security scenario by modifying the asset and redirect to it do you have any plan to do that from the console itself sorry can you repeat that question again if you have any plans to prevent a threat from the console itself and not being redirect to the asset yeah so there's a couple of ways we're working on that in the next couple of weeks we're going to release an open source set of cloud functions it's really go code that can be deployed as cloud functions to consume findings from both sha at security health analytics and event threat detection to take automatic action in two classes of enrichment so you can take a finding decorated with additional information you can increase your log level you can take some enforcement actions as well and so that's the first step in that journey is taking findings out of the pub/sub into a cloud function and giving you as a user the ability to do what you want the longer-term vision is to make that more of a first-class function in security command center where you can register functions against finding types and say if I see this finding click this button do the action or schedule this action to always happen on some interval also stay tuned we know the number of you use existing soar products so we'll also be working we're working with various or vendors make sure there's a direct integration as well from the pub sub from command center allow you to trigger those things thank you I think there's one behind there's one over here and then one bar so if I have a custom sacred rules can I import them to secure this end and let's say my organization has policies that message can be open only from certain IP yeah so find me afterwards and I'd love to get your thoughts on what are the first couple of ways you want to do that we've thought about both ways to import threat intelligence well as ways to make users empowered to build high quality rules there's debate about which is more valuable in the short term and which is more sustainable in the long term yeah to pop up a level in addition to inducing your own threat intelligence there's a lot very different types of policies that customers have you may have vulnerability with detection rules you may have threat intelligence you may have specific threats monitoring pieces today if you're looking at status checks and config checks for customized policies the for steady integration allows you the way out-of-the-box to do that POW can tackle it we'll talk a little bit more about our future with security health analytics and Tim can talk a little bit about what we want to do with custom rules on threat detection yeah I mean for security health unless it's similar as what Tim said so we're gonna continue to expand the detectors we have out of box and our goal there is that with that scope improving over time that'll cover a lot of the needs that customers have there is always going to be need for customized scanners or customized detection and we'll get to that in just a matter of trading those things off and making that progress as any mention there's also the first SETI project so what many customers do is they deploy a combination of security health analytics for these out of box kind of compliance and recommendation based scanners and they use for study for their role their own customs specific policies and then longer term you'll start to see better better collaboration between where you define policies in GCP and then the monitoring that happens on that but those those are the different types of things that we're thinking about building it also finally that you know we have a rich ecosystem of partners so we have a lot of customers successfully lose use things like Prisma or a cloud guard from dome 9 in addition to security health Analects we use security how things provides a base level of capability built into the platform and then we also have strong partners that allow you to add additional customization I think there's one back there and then there's one of okay all right so next question then hi so it's good to see that you whole thing do you functionality but my key question is why do you allow people to open SSH why is there a default policy and why can't we have a policy driven asset tag which says do you know what for development it's fine for production it's not sure so the feedback question why is that the default that there is the ability to have that open at a high level so we are working with the our organization policy team to add additional top level design policies that allow you to constrain configurations many of our customers use policy as code and config is code and what they do is rather than have individuals allow users to spin up developer development and I and VMs they do that through a mediated service and that mediate service runs a fixed deployment configuration that's one of the ways we've seen that scale folks force that policy today but absolutely we're also working with our organization policy team so you can set that as an organization policy looking for just expanding on that there are already a set of organization policies you can apply that do map to the types of detections we have here and so as I said those will be expanding over time and you'll see that that integration apologize I have to question one what's the roadmap for cloud function security so some control are a runtime and the other one is how do you think to integrate with bigquery and so if there is any plan on that because from an analytics security analysis would be a natural evolution so I can take a little bit of that and then I'll let my colleagues here add on to it so for security health analytics as I said we're working very closely with CIS to expand their benchmarks and their recommendations today they cover a set of services and so we have scanners that map to those services we're working with them on future versions of the CIS recommendation set to expand and include things like bigquery and cloud functions and as we come up with those recommendations scanners will also be available in fact as part of our alpha we do have a few bigquery scanners like a public data set scanner that will that are available and then the question was can I get to be logged in to get oh yeah so today one of the reasons we're doing the Alpha notifications is to provide you a pub/sub path which then can be directed either through stackdriver or directly into a whole bunch of export options whether it's szymek sport TCS export so today there is a path through Google products to get from command center into pub/sub and into bigquery and DCs and we'll be investing more in doing that in a lot more seamless way also today your ETD findings can be optionally written to stackdriver which has a native hook straight into bigquery statue Ivor which handles all of your DCP logging we'll take all of your gtp logs quite happily into bigquery as well so whether you want to take the raw inputs DTD or the refined outputs you can get both into bigquery today with about three clicks in the console all right okay but I need to consider the cost as well you will need to consider the cost the cost for your raw logs will be much higher ETD findings are on average a kilobyte so if we produce a million of those you'll be looking at about a gig of storage which is I think three cents hot line and one and a half cents cold line so we can work really hard for you until you're paying for storage on that I think there was a question over here hi the web permeability scanner are there any plans to extend to firebase we're looking at a bunch of different stuff I don't think there's anything about firebase we have to announce right now so yeah come see us after you come see us after and we could talk about it one on the front here hi yes sort of relates to the first question about taking automatic actions are there any plans on taking actions on the Google layer like the blocking traffic that you yeah - malicious absolutely so this demo that I did for you today was truncated slightly a previous version of it that we cut for the interest of time actually had me go back to the attack VM and have the attack fail because we had used a cloud function to update the firewall rule while I was on stage and deny traffic on port 22 so we're absolutely looking at ways to take findings and take that information and move it back into your infrastructure on the load balancer in cloud armor side that's another thing we're looking at doing yeah just to be clear on the load balancer site so cloud armor is now GA and with the same set of cloud functions given that a lot of how our cloud functions work is they react to a pub sub event even use existing API hooks you can then make that connection sort of pub sub event here can generate an action in cloud armor to either add to the IP you denialist or allow list or change one of the underlying rules so that integration right now is not a managed service but the components are in place for you to build a particular workflow and at the spoke way I think there was a question up front here okay you first and then I think the how do you do in Google you calculate the return of the actions that you're actually taking so the return of so the value or yes is that about how we choose what priority we do things or about how we decide which things to build our quest clearly on question how do you achieve higher level of security with the smallest sure so I'll start with that and then my colleagues can can add to it the way we think about things first is is very data-driven one of the reasons we invest in security health alex is as Kyle talked about a majority what we've seen across our customers industry is seen the main source of security essentially breaches innocence today in cloud is due to that issue of MIS configuration so the we focus first on the things that a low-hanging fruit make sure there are a better safer defaults B we have monitoring and automated tools to help you understand your security posture and then we work down the list I think some of the things Tim showed are again focused on the most common things that customers see when mining brute-forcing and so that's kind of the approach we take on the ETD side our prioritization has been driven by a couple of factors in part we wanted to take advantage of the uniquely powerful threat intelligence that Google had internally so we developed the IP domain and soon-to-be-released hash based detectors using our internal powers so that's one thing is how do we take the most advantage of Google the second thing was looking at the threats that we were seeing across the network of our own use of Google Cloud so Google uses cloud extensively and we wanted to understand how is Google losing to bad guys in cloud and what can we learn from that surface so that was a second input to our prioritization the third was what are the threats that cloud users face that are uniquely cloudy in meaning things that security professionals maybe don't have background for detecting with existing tooling or techniques in the industry and how can we take advantage of being the platform provider to give you uniquely powerful detections that department that one inspired our IM detector and is going to inspire a couple of detectors that i'm not my TL left so i could talk about it he won't beat me up but i won't talk about it yet but there's a couple more detectors coming next quarter that are uniquely focused in that area so our fertilization has been take advantage of google learn from google do things that are uniquely google powered no I want to echo what Tim said for web security scanner as well like the the detection z' we have there we've already kind of prioritized for best bang for a buck because we did that for google and google has to prioritize like our work as well so customers get that same advantage for security health olympics we started with the most common baseline level of security because we know that these are the things that if you solve you're at a pretty good starting point hey so I'm curious about your malware the malware domain an IP list so how are they detected like this configuration could your scanners to take them and add them to that list and correctly so there are false positives so your applications being blacklisted it's your ability to talk to other third parties could be compromised because you are I guess on that lesson how would your immediate that to get them off and how those blacklist this work so maybe can you repeat the question in a little bit louder I think in the upside so with your scanning you had a list of domains and IP addresses that you're blacklisted so how are they added to it and if your scans or someone's misconfigured and it gets added to there as a false positive that could destruct got your application so what steps would you go to a media and there especially if its production and you can't function right so maybe there's summarize question I think their concern is about there's always a dynamic between especially if any system has a false positive if you now miss blacklist or rather a denial is something that has production impact how do you handle that the general nature of the thing and how do you dine out using Google's lusts so you've got because I saw that you had a Google listed of wait-listed domains and IPS so that's manageable you guys not by use a crazy yes Tim can talk a little bit more but first that list of threat intelligence we use is stuff that's related to things obviously outside of Google validated from Dilla standpoint I mean we do take feedback I was from customers around you know IPS that potentially are not bad but it's an interaction yeah we're really quite focused right now in improving the quality of that list and making sure that the domains and IPS that we have in their market is malicious or indeed malicious my users in the audience can testify to our both responsiveness to this issue and previous failure to respond to the issue it's been an interesting journey taking what we use internally and making it work externally there are a lot of ways that Google is very much like the world and a couple of key places where it's not like the world and so learning from that and making sure that we have a high quality threat feed for you and not blow up your sock with unnecessary noise as part of the continuing journey for ETD we're making both process and technology investments in that area and I think that both users would be maybe happy to say that we have moved the needle on that one we have room to continue to go but we're making a lot of progress there thank you from the cacb perspective can we integrate the cloud command security center before deploying any docker containers to production or and you know prevent death threats yeah so so I can to repeat the question I think the question is if you're doing it integrates the ICT process what part of the checks are integrated commences you can use that as well to monitor what's going on so with one of the sidecar applications that we ship with cloud scary command center with integration of binary authorization so if you're using the deployment and essentially admission control for binary authorization we'll also be able to see in the cloud security command center both fails for deploy based on policy violations as well as break glass situation so that if you see things that are deployed but actually violation policy because of break back both of those findings are also available in command center and we are working with the vulnerability scanning folks for container scanning as well to integrate those type of data in there as well so on build and on deploy and stay tuned for some time the future for during run time thank you any other questions up yes thank you okay my question is from sa sorry can you just be a couple I think there I'm sorry I'm hearing my own voice I'm asking about si se perspective about the edge IOT the future of Google I mean how will you be supporting use cases that are driven by IOT devices concerns mesh networks etc so to repeat the question I think your specific focus was on as the scale up in IOT with the great scale of devices the kind of limited power at the endpoint devices what's our strategy right now for how does that work on the security standpoint right so I think what we're seeing is essentially and we're not making an announcements here but it's a hard problem it's first a large data problems so there are a couple points where we would be able to essentially inject in that one is in the integration of data and scanning status the second is really in the authorization and permissioning and authentication piece if you've been at any other güell security talks much of how Google does security is based on device based service based data based identity and that's likely the area that we'll continue to invest in and work on as you look at largely distributed devices and the large volume of data any other questions well yeah and thank you guys all for sitting through here thanks guys really appreciate you all coming [Applause] [Music]
