 move over sd-wan there's some new tech in town sassy or secure access service edge is a cloud-based architecture that converges an organization's network and security services sassy a term coined by gartner combines network security functions with wan capabilities such as sd-wan the idea is that sassy targets networking and security shortcomings that traditional wan and sd-wan architectures can't fully address while sd-wan solves many connectivity issues related to mpls it doesn't account for the fact that enterprise architectures center not only on the data center but also on the cloud and for security sd-wan must still backhaul traffic to the data center for inspection sassy on the other hand brings inspection engines closer to the traffic entry points after which traffic can then be forwarded to the internet or other sassy clients ultimately it converges previously separated networking and security capabilities into one service sassy touts four main attributes a global sd-wan footprint meaning it includes an sd-wan service that operates over a private backbone to keep enterprise traffic off the internet and overcome latency problems distributed inspection and policy enforcement to protect and connect devices a cloud native architecture with no specific hardware dependencies to enable cost-effective scaling as needed and the ability to provide services based on the identity and context of the connection source user devices and location sassy brings benefits like reduced complexity and cost improved performance better security and improved it operations but it is still an emerging market and will likely take a few years to mature do you see the benefit of sassy adoption any downsides let us know in the comments and be sure to hit that like button too [Music] you
