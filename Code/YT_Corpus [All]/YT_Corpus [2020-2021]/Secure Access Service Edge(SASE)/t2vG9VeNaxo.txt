 [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hi everybody this is a shy I'd like to share with you today a very interesting development in the market were tracking the introduction of a new category by Gartner called the secure access service edge or sassy sassy has showed up initially on Gartner's hype cycle for enterprise networking in 2019 which was published on July the hype cycle is a way for gardener to track different technologies in enterprise networking and where they sit on the enterprise adoption cycle to the left are emerging technologies that are kind of climbing the up the slope as they become more recognized by enterprises and on the right is where those technologies are get better understood by enterprises with their potential and ultimately the full mainstream adoption until those technologies phase out so sassy obviously is an early edge in technology early stage technology what's interesting is that Gartner maps out 29 different technologies and categories into this table to the left a technology can be low have low impact on IT have moderate impacts on IT which means that it's beneficial but not you know strategic some technologies have high impact such as SD ware and and Fowler is a service which means are gonna change in some significant way the way IT does business but only three Cal technologies are on this hype cycle are transformational transformational means that a technology or a category will deeply change the way I he is run is managed and the way it supports the business and so the secured access service age or sassy is such category so what is sassy godless states that sassy services will converge a number of disparate network and network security services including SD when secure web gateway Cosby SDP DNS protection and fire as a service and this is the first time that Godin recognizes that the needs to converge multiple technologies into a single service which has been Cato's vision since we were founded in 2015 now why is it why is it that convergence is now needed and the reason is obvious again digital transformation and the adoption of mobile cloud and edge fundamentally changed nat network traffic patterns rendering existing network and security models obsolete to the right you can see how kato views this problem essentially the proliferation of point solutions is a result of the change in the network topology from a physical branch and data center network to cloud mobile and global footprints so what is it the customers needs are from their new network and what they need in moving forward as they try to transform their businesses they need simplicity scalability flexibility performance and security and this will drive a convergence of these two distinct markets the networking market and the security market have to come together and we couldn't agree more basically this has been our value proposition to all of our 400 customers the fact that Cato with the Cato cloud has built a converged software stock that deliver a wide range of networking and security capabilities within a scalable and flexible cloud service that is easy to manage next is the move towards an identity based security and networking so identity is essential to be able to grant a quality of service and choose service levels and deliver security services based on who who is connecting to the network as opposed to where they live or where they sit and we've infused identity awareness throughout the Cato service we know for each session for each connection that is connected though that is established into the Cato cloud who is the user with the identity behind that session this is seamlessly built into the entire kettle platform which is identity driven and identity aware next is how would a sassy architecture look like and Gardner says most saucy offerings will be purpose-built for scale-out cloud native and cloud-based delivery and yet again this is the description of the Cato architecture Cato cloud is built on a cloud native and high-performance traffic processing engine we deliver all the capabilities from that cloud service optimising network traffic to the data center to the cloud globally and then inspecting through deep packet inspection capabilities are the traffic for threats with our next-generation firewall secure web gateway anti-malware IPS and other security capabilities these are all delivered through this cloud native cloud based platform next we have to deliver the service globe Gardner states that saucy requires a cloud delivery based approach favoring providers with many points of presence or parks and it's not going to be enough just to use cloud providers like AWS and Asia you have to make a significant investment to ensure that your service is geographically dispersed to support all business resources for your customers over the past four years kato has built that network which now spends 50 global points of presence which are totally independent of the cloud providers footprint and we are adding three or four popes every quarter using this footprint were actually able to push out the networking and the security services there are part of the cloud native architecture to be in close proximity for every location every user every device that is used by our customers and lastly there is a requirement for Sasi to support not only branches but users and clouds Gartner states that some agent-based capabilities clients will be necessary for devices and some on premise based capabilities will be required for quality of service and path selection and everything has to be cloud managed Kato by design is has been architected to support all edges a physical edge like a headquarters a data center or a branch a cloud edge like AWS Asia and others mobile edges for both desktops laptops and mobile devices iOS and Android and of course connecting all of those among themselves and towards internet-based services like obviously 65 are in other services so this has been designed and built in an architected not bolted on after the fact using acquisitions or third party product integrations so this is the overall Cato architecture and you can see the different pieces we talked about the convert network security stack the Pope's the different edge a solution that we have appliances and clients the way we integrate cloud infrastructure and cloud applications in total Cato has all the different components that entail a Stasi service identity driven and cloud native traffic processing engine that is distributed globally over multiple points of presence supporting all edges physical cloud and mobile and fully managed through a cloud-based management console so if this is sassy and Cato is a sassy platform what isn't sassy god--not warns customers that they have to be aware that sassy is really about architecture and implementation sassy isn't the chaining of point solutions linking together different products especially if it came from if they came from different acquisitions why because each codebase each product requires separate management separate footprint and it becomes very difficult to scale that product that service offering globally when so many when you have so many moving parts sass is also not about on-premises boxes sassy offerings that rely on boxes will be unable to meet the requirements of an increasingly mobile workforce in latency-sensitive applications why Gartner gives a simple example they basically state that you cannot you don't want to bring the traffic to where your engines your networking and security engines reside but you want to make sure that those engines are available to process the traffic in close proximity to the source ok this is basic two contradicting architecture where the sassy cloud-based approach is actually naturally aligned with processing traffic close to the source we're using appliances require requires traffic to be delivered to where those engines are in the data centers the branches and the other physical locations where they typically reside lastly sassy is not a telco bonded the telcos are combining the worse of both approaches they use CPE or reclines based strategy using technologies they do not own have not developed and are not cloud native in nature which means the sassy creates an alternative garden calls it an existential threat to the telco strategy that is based on those elements so if so what is when will sassy be deployed well sassy is actually available or driven by catalyst that a customers are experiencing today in the business on one hand this MPLS offload and MPLS replacement projects that are led by Sdn network security and networking equipment refresh cycles that creates an opportunity to move from a physical firewalls to fire as a service and on the flip side the introduction of new kind of projects to enable secure and optimized access for the mobile workforce these projects go beyond physical locations and into mobile scenarios and Kato covers all these bases seamlessly which means that Kato is future proofing your networking security you can start with projects that are focused on the physical locations such as Sdn and global connectivity expanded to include security capabilities and ultimately extend the deployment to cover cloud resources and mobile you users are all within the same platform this is the sassy vision essentially which is you will not have to go and integrate duct-tape bundle and otherwise deploy point solutions for point means you can grow with a single platform that is designed to deliver the capabilities that you need when you need them the bottom line kado is the world's first sassy platform that natively converges sd1 and network security in the cloud other players have bits and pieces of these architectures some have cloud capabilities some have on Prem capabilities some blending but no other player in the world right now has a well-thought-out purposely built designed from the ground up to deliver a sassy platform this is what kato had done in the last five years so what about the features so garden lists many features and product abilities that could be built into the sassy platform you can see here on the right side within the ring' all the different capabilities can are already covered we have quite a coverage but the point is that it's very easy to add capabilities that we do not currently have because we have the right architecture the right engine to build this capability into so this is essentially the point is that it's easy to add features to write architecture and it's very difficult to add features through acquisitions through integrations through trying to bundle things in in some loosely coupled way which ultimately means that things don't scale well they are not delivered properly in the in the global sense requires a lot of maintenance and costs and that essentially defeats the purpose of sassy to close what are the key takes so sassy is a major driver of Dijkstra transformation across when the one age security cloud and mobility at the global scale and the canno cloud is a sassy platform that enables a smooth digital transformation journey this is what I t's looking for to gradually move to this converged platform next sassy is a new architecture it's not a retrofit of legacy networking and security point solutions and architectures you don't evolve from duct-taping appliances services and other components together you need to architect the everything from the ground up is a converged cloud native service and lastly sassy is future proofing networking and security the cloud first model of sassy enables rapid delivery of new capabilities and a cloud-based architecture easily support current and new edges and the kind of cloud is a very good example of how the right architecture can rapidly evolve to address current and emerging business needs as we quickly roll out new capabilities that seamlessly show up in our customer consoles and underlying infrastructure without them having to maintain scale size or otherwise support the infrastructure they just have to focus on running the business thank you for listening and to learn more about how carro fits into the sassy story visit us at Kira networks comm slash sassy thank you [Applause] [Music]
