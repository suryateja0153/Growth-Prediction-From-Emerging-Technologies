 What is edge computing? Edge computing takes place at the edge of the administrative domain. Here, discrete data sources and end users can access the rest of the network. By bringing together services such as network and storage closer to consumers, response times improve and bandwidth is saved, among many other improvements. Today, it is especially beneficial to place workloads as close to the edge as possible as devices can react faster to advanced market drivers such as the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence.
