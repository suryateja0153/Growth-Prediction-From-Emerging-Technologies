 from around the globe it's thecube with digital coverage of vmworld 2020 brought to you by vmware and its ecosystem partners welcome back i'm stu miniman and this is thecube's coverage of vmworld 2020 our 11th year covering the show and of course networking has been a big growth story for vmware for a number of years going back to the nicer acquisition for over a billion dollars we're really leveraging all of the virtual networking and sd-wan has been another hot topic a couple years ago it was the velo cloud acquisition and now happy to welcome to the program two of the fellow cloud business executives first of all we have sanjay upal he is the senior vice president and general manager of that mentioned division of vmware and joining him is craig connors who's the vice president and chief technology officer for that same division he was the chief architect of velo cloud craig sanjay thank you for joining us thank you thank you all right so sanjay first of all uh nice uh you know call outs and a lot of news uh that we're gonna get to dig into in the morning keynote you know pat sanjay the team uh you know a couple of years ago pat talked about you know the next billion dollar business is networking uh your team helping to add to that and uh a new term uh thrown out that we're gonna get to talk a little bit about uh our forensic gartner uh termed it sassy so i'll let you uh you know explain a little bit the news uh that this wonderful new four-letter acronym that the gartner's passed at us um why don't you start us there yeah i couldn't be more excited to be here at vmworld announcing this expansion of what's going on in sd-wan so sd-wan was all about bringing branch office users to their applications and doing that in a really efficient manner throwing out all those complex hardware appliances and simplifying everything with software increasing the quality of experience for the user but now what has happened is you know they want security to be dealt off in the same way same simplicity and automation same great user experience and at the same time you know blocking all these attacks that are coming in from various places and kovit has just driven that even more meaning that you need to get to networking and network security to be brought together in this simple and automated way while keeping the end user experience be great and while giving it what they need which is high security and good manageability so this acronym sassy secure access service edge it really is the bringing together of net networking and network security both as a service that service angle is really important and the exciting part about what we're announcing at the at vmworld here is the expansion of the sd-wan pops and gateways into becoming sassy pops and now customers can get a whole slew of services both networking and network security services from vmware so that's the announcement wonderful craig you know since since you've helped with so much of the architecture here i want to geek out a little bit uh when it comes to the security stuff that sanjay was talking about i remember dealing back with lan optimization solutions and trying to remember okay wait when can i compress when can i encrypt you know what do i lay on top of it um sd-wan you know fits into this story help us understand what does you know velocloud do what is it from the partner ecosystem uh you know so no there's there's some good partners that you have helping us help us understand you know what exactly we mean because security is such a broad term yeah thanks so there's four components in the sassy pop that we're bringing together obviously vmware sd-wan is one of those sanjay mentioned the changing workforce we have off-net users that aren't coming from behind an sd-wan branch more and more today so we also have secure access powered by our workspace one solution that's bringing those remote users into the pop and then two different security solutions uh secure web gateway functionality and that is a next generation secure web gateway that includes things like dlp and remote browser isolation and as you saw in the news today that's powered through our oem agreement with menlo security and then we have next-gen firewalling for securing corporate traffic and that's powered by our own vmware nsx firewall which has been recently augmented with our last line acquisition so those are the four key components coming together within our sassy pop and of course we also have our continued partnership with zscaler for our our large joint vmware z-scaler customer base to facilitate that security solution as well yeah so sanjay maybe it would make sense uh as you said you've got a a portfolio uh nat now in this market uh you've got vdi you've got edge walk us through if you could except some of the most important use cases uh for for your business yeah so you know the the use case that has taken off in the last several years since the advent of sd-wan is to get sites so these would be branch offices and a branch office could be an agricultural field it could be a plane it could be an oil rig you know it could be any one of these this is a branch office so these sites how to get them connected to the applications that they need to get access to so telemedicine example so how do you get doctors diagnosticians and all that that are sitting in their clinics and hospitals to get great access to the applications and the applications can be anywhere they don't have to be back in your data centers you know after data center consolidation happened some of the apps you know were in the data centers but then after the cloud advent came then the apps were everywhere they're in the public cloud both in iaas as well as in sas and then now they're moving back towards the edge because of the advent of edge computing so that's really the primary use case that sd-wan has been all about and that's where you know we have staked the claim to be the leader in that space now with covid the use cases are expanding and obviously with work from home you take the same telemedicine example the doctors and diagnosticians who used to work from hospitals and clinics now have to get it done when they're working from the home and of course this is a business critical app and so what do you do how do you get these folks who are at home to get the same quality of experience the same security the same manageability but at the same time you cannot disturb the other people who are working from home because that is an entire ecosystem you serve the business user but you also serve the needs of the home users keeping privacy in mind so these two cases branch access and then remote access which craig talked about these are the primary use cases and then they break down by vertical so depending on whether it's health or it's federal or it's manufacturing or its finance then you have sub-use cases underneath that but this is how we from a from a vcn standpoint you know claim to have 17 000 customers that have deployed our networking solutions a large fraction of those being our sd-wan solutions today yeah okay craig one of those terms that gets thrown around a lot in the industry is scale i look at certain uh parts of the market uh you know say kubernetes kubernetes was about you know bringing together lots of sites but now we're spending a lot of time talking about edge which is a whole different scale same thing if you talk about devices and iot can you speak to us a little bit about you know fundamentally you know that branch architecture i think sets you up well but when i start thinking about edge it probably is uh you know uh you know larger number and some different challenges so so maybe maybe some differences that happen to happen in in the code to make that happen yeah absolutely i mean i think you know we've been fortunate in the success that we've had in our sd-wan deployments more than 280 000 branches deployed with our sd-wan solution so scale is something that's been near and dear to our heart from the beginning how do you build a multi-tenant service in the cloud how do you build cloud scale and we brought that aspect into all of these components through containerization as you mentioned through horizontal scalability bringing them into our own dedicated pops where we control the hardware we control the hypervisor obviously built on top of vmware esxi that allows us to deliver scale in a way that other competitors may not be able to achieve yeah sanjay now it's been more a couple of years since the acquisition uh by vmware give us a little bit of an update if you would as to you know what i'm sure obviously customer reach uh and adoption uh greatly increased by by the channel and go to market but you know directionally and you know any difference in use cases uh that that you've seen uh now being part of vmware yeah absolutely you know there's been an expansion in the use cases which is why this fit was very good meaning velocloud being a part of vmware so if you look at it what the wide area network does we're the place where you know ties we tie it all together and tie what together if you look at the end user computing which craig was mentioning the clients are digital workspace workspace one client well those clients now will connect to our sassy pop so that's one tie-in that obviously we couldn't have and we were an independent company the other side of it when you go from the sassy pop into the data center then we tie into nsx not just at the cloud firewall but in the data center itself so when we can extend micro segmentation so that's another k use case that is becoming prevalent then the third aspect of this is really when you run inside telecom operators and vmware has a very robust business as it goes after telcos with the software stack and so running our gateways running our sassy pops at the telco environment then gets us to integrate with what's going on with our telecom business unit we also have what we are doing on a visibility and telemetry perspective so we had acquired a company called nyansa which we are crafting into an edge network intelligence product that then fits in into vmware's overall foray in this space we have a product suite called we realize network insight and so that network insight combined with what we are doing from a from a business unit standpoint gives customers an end-to-end view from a from an individual client through the cloud even up to an individual container and so we call this client to cloud to container all of this is possible because we are part of vmware and the last piece of this is something that's going to happen we believe next year which is edge computing when edge computing comes in you know i jokingly say to my team this acronym of sassy which is s-a-s-e you've got to insert a c in the middle so it becomes s-a-c-s-e and how does that pronounce that says saxi so i know it sounds a bit a little bit awkward but that c stands for the compute so as you put compute in the computer that's going to run at the edge the computer that's going to run at the pop and the sassy is going to become you know sexy and who better to give that to you than vmware because you know we have that management stack that controls uh compute for customers today well definitely i think you're you're drawing from the elon musk school of uh you know how to name acronyms and and products do so sunshine that's really interesting uh craig talk us a little bit about that vision to get there uh you know what do we need to do as an industry how's the product mature give us a little bit of that that road map forward if you would yeah i think you know sassy is really the convergence of five key things one is this distributed pop architecture so how do you deliver this compute and these services near to the customer's premise and that's something that companies like us have have had years of experience in building out and then the the four key components of sassy that we have you know zero trust access sd-wan uh next-generation firewalling and secure web gateway we're fortunate as sanjay said to be part of vmware where we don't have to invent some of these components because we already have workspace one and we already have the nsx distributed firewall and we already have vmware sd-wan and so a lot of companies you'll see are trying to to put all of these parts together we already had them in house we're putting them under one umbrella the one place where we didn't have a technology within vmware that's where we're leveraging these partnerships with memo and zscaler to get it done sanjay i think the the telco use case that you talked about is really important one uh we've definitely seen you know really good adoption from from vmware working in those spaces uh the one place i i want to understand though if you look at vcf and how that moves to you know to aws to azure uh even to oracle's talked about in the keynote this morning how does sd-wan fit into just that kind of traditional hybrid cloud deployment we've been talking about the last couple of years yeah that's a great question so you know when you look at st van the name connotes software defined but it doesn't it's not specific to branch office access at all and when you look at vcf what vcf is doing is really modernizing your compute stack and now you can run this modern compute stack at your own data centers you can run it in the private cloud you can run it on the public cloud as well right so you can put these stacks on amazon azure uh you know google and and then run them so what an sd-wan architecture allows you to do is not just get your branch and secure users to access the applications that are running on those compute stacks but you can also intermediate between them so when customers come in and they say that they want simplified networking and security between two public uh cloud providers this is the the multi-cloud use case then getting that networking to work in a seamless fashion with high security can be done by an sd-wan architecture and our sassy pop is perfectly situated to do that and all you would need to do is add virtual services at the sassy pop an enterprise customer would come in and i they say they want some v-nets here and some vpcs there they want to look at them in an automated fashion they want to set it up you know with the point-and-click architecture and not have to do all this manual work and we can get that done so there's a there's a really good fit between sassy sd-wan and where vcf is going to solve the multi-cloud problem that people are having right now excellent i really appreciate that that that uh explanation uh last thing i guess i'll ask is uh you know here at vmworld i'm sure you've got a lot of breakouts you've probably got some good customers uh sharing some of their stories so anonymous if it has to be but we would love if you've got uh either of you so some examples uh to help bring home uh the value that your solutions are delivering great why didn't i start with one and then craig can fill in the other one um so let me start off with the with the tele medicine example so we have uh you know customer called md anderson cancer center and these are the folks in in texas and they provide a really really important service and that service is uh you know providing patients who are critically ill to give them all the kinds of services whether they come into the clinic or whether they're across a network connection and their radiologists and doctors are sitting at home so i think it's very important use case and you know we started off by deploying in the hospitals and the clinics but when kovit hit that to send a lot of these folks to work from home and then when they work from home it's really this device that goes in which you can see here this is our bellow cloud edge and this um as i said in one of the my my favorite song says there's nothing this box can't do all right so this box goes home into the you know doctor's home and then they are talking to their patient getting telemedicine done because it solves the problem of performance um you know that some of those folks have literally said that this thing was a godsend now it's not very often that networking people you know have been told that their products are like godsend so i'll take that with a little bit of grain of salt but we are solving a very important problems increasing the performance we are also this is a secure device so it's not going to be hacked into and then makes things much more manageable from an i.t standpoint so this is one of those use cases and there's plenty of them but craig has his favorite so i'll turn it over to him there's so many i could bore you i think you know one really interesting one is an investment banking company that we have as a customer and they used to go work in the office five days a week and everything that they did was on their computer in the office and with this pivot to work from home post covid they think their future is a flexible work workforce where sometimes they're in the office and sometimes they're remote and when they're remote they're rdping into their desktop that is staying in their office and with their legacy remote access vpn solution they had to connect uh say i'm a user sitting in southern california i'm connecting my vpn to chicago to then come across the network back to los angeles to get to my desktop so that i can work from home and now with sassy my secure access client from workspace one connects to the closest sassy pop i'd get to my desktop in my office tremendously lower latency tremendously higher quality of experience for the users whether they're you know at home on the road anywhere they need to access that device oh craig sanjay thank you so much love the customer example sanjay good job bringing out the box to show people it's a software world but uh the the sassy hardware is still needed uh at times too thanks for joining all right thank you stu thanks craig cheers all right stay with us for more coverage of vmworld 2020 i'm stu miniman thanks as always for watching thecube you
