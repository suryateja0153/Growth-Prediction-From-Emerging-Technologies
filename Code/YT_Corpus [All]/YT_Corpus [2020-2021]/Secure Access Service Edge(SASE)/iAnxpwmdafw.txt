 hello my name is Dara Such and as VP and Publisher I oversee the cybersecurity practice here at TechTarget during my more than 15 years in this market I've witnessed a lot of change everything from the technology available to protect businesses to evolving marketing strategies targeting buyers of security solutions and even around exactly how decision-making and buying teams themselves have evolved. as a publisher TechTarget is continuously adapting and responding to changes like this after all we're content marketers too and our business model includes operating the largest direct marketing engine in b2b tech so as we enter another phase of change we wanted to share some of what we've learned so that demand and revenue marketers like yourself can be sure that your activities yield maximum impact on your organization's revenue market and wallet share now to kick things off let's start with some positive news out of all major technology trends measured cyber security and risk management tops the list of technologies that the TechTarget community in your prospects intend to allocate the greatest amount of additional budget to in 2020 that means security beat out cloud AI DevOps and even IT automation as it relates to budget line item growth while that's great news there are three major trends or change agents that are important to be mindful of as you seek to capture as much of that budget as possible digital transformation and its associated impact on staffing and departmental collaboration macro job trends coupled with the tech skills gap which we know impacts the security market more acutely than any other and finally the recent book very real impact of covid19 let's take a closer look at each of these change agents to understand how they're requiring marketers to also adapt so in today's business environment to adequately compete and keep up with the demands of our customers and employees alike 70% of businesses are actively engaged in activities to support digital transformation our change agent number one very nature of digital transformation taps into technology concepts that are horizontal or Dept agnostic and require collaboration for multiple teams things like automating processes adopting more AI or machine learning and improving an organization's overall risk and security posture well what we often overlook is just how businesses do digital transformation while much is technology driven the people and staffing are crucial elements to achieving the business goals in fact when we pull those actively engaged in digital transformation efforts two of the ten activities they cite are entirely focused on people and team management 35% are breaking down departmental silos - just to support digital transformation and foster better collaboration across teams and nearly 30% are explicitly restructuring staff and those teams to enable that better collaboration now turning to change agent number two the jobs and skills dynamics within cyber security we know the job of cyber security pros is a difficult one mistakes can lead to fines job loss and historical challenges attracting candidates like women or Millennials each who represent about 50% of the workforce have left the industry with a supply and demand problem where fewer candidates are seeking careers in this field than the demand for them ISC2 actually sites that four million jobs will go unfilled within cyber security and nearly 70 percent of companies cite a shortage of security staff and even fewer organizations staff for the role of a CSO so leadership roles are not immune to this they're also impacted now that's a little bit on the cause but the effect is really where I want to draw your attention despite these challenges with staffing businesses must still prioritize cybersecurity its business critical to respond to these dynamics and the lack of supply much like with digital transformation business and IT leaders are going horizontal they're developing from within and performing on-the-job training to folks in adjacent apartments half of businesses are explicitly seeking versatile list candidates who can do the job of multiple functions and when you ask the IT pros themselves nearly seventy percent agree that their involvement in shortlisting and evaluating vendors goes way beyond what their title might indicate in fact from a recent indeed jobs report only about forty percent of all jobs posted with a focus on cyber security have the word security in the job title so bottom line here is like we've been saying for years security truly is everyone's responsibility and we're seeing that manifest all the way through to team collaboration as it pertains to vendor solution shortlisting in consideration finally and perhaps the most acute and immediate change agent number three covid19 as businesses adapt to a new style of work we know how crucial cybersecurity is in the era of covid19 as work from home has quickly become the new norm security pros are not absolved from that either folks who maybe may have previously sat physically in a security operation center are also displaced not only impacting how they do their jobs but making it harder for you to connect with those folks who are already quite scarce additionally in early March Gartner had already projected a 25% absenteeism rate with an IT due to layoffs or illness coupled with the pre-existing jobs trends within cybersecurity marketers within this category should expect more and more non security constituents taking up the mantle within targeted organizations to help offset these dynamics the silver lining however is security solutions have been very much democratized good basic security hygiene and traditional blocking and tackling based technology solutions are in high demand everything from multi-factor authentication antivirus and basic network security simultaneously more strategic and complex security challenges like tackling dev stack ops cloud security and enabling a truly perimeter-less environment are drawing rapid attention to growth categories like SAAS secure web gateway and virtual security operation centers and we see this activity manifesting in real time using our purchase intent now despite these strong agents of change impacting the very teams your organization is targeting you may still be saying that you'd prefer to focus on what has worked for you previously let's take a look at the impact these three change agents are already having on in market research as it relates to persona targeting so using application security and the dev stack ops category as an example here's a quick look at just how dramatically different the job is to build and secure applications and data within them today what used to be somewhat self-contained is now a multi faceted ecosystem of different technology needs functionality and considerations no one person role or department can adequately own this end-to-end independently today's application security and dev stack ops persona at the very least include these three core functional roles each with different but highly important priorities and project requirements yet this live example at FedEx we can see how true pre-purchase research at Enterprise size companies includes more than 24 individuals each who represent different facets of the hub-and-spoke we just reviewed and yet oftentimes marketers willingly exclude some of the most active stakeholders researching within this same company at the same time on related topics because they don't need a preconceived notion of a title being important and to take this further when we look at individual content pieces particularly by stage content essential to shaping project requirements like this one we see how breaking down departmental silos translates directly to pre-purchase research this is a real-life look at the digital body language showing how distributed and collaborative buying teams have become now this is not limited to just application security we have seen similar across departmental research patterns across many categories within the security practice you're looking at here are actual live confirmed IT projects which were confirmed to TechTarget by members of the buying team outside of the security function as a marketer are you comfortable not engaging with buyers in these categories simply because their title didn't match your desired profile would you not sell to Visa or Farmers Insurance for that reason now in fact when we look broadly across all confirmed projects tied to cyber security only about a quarter originate from people with explicit security titles and that makes a lot of sense when you think about how important security is across all facets of IT and business coupled with some of the dynamics we previously discussed around the scarcity of cyber security professionals as a marketer I would view active research from non security roles or personas as a means to increase my opportunity generation by up to three fold simply by eliminating title driven restrictions in my outbound or data-driven activities now to play that out a bit let's look at some real proof points where customers of ours have successfully accelerated their revenue and closed-won deals by focusing on activity and intent rather than a restricted persona driven approach in this example there are two deals that were one representing a total of $300,000 in revenue by embracing access to all engaged buyers researching regardless of their role this vendor not only won a deal entirely invisible to their competitor they also won another deal by having three times more contacts to influence versus a competitor with a title restriction on a program in another category a similar dynamic plays out and in this situation nearly three-quarters of the opportunities could have been entirely invisible or exponentially harder to win have the focus been solely on security focused roles alone now I know most marketers I'm in contact with would gladly claim close to three hundred thousand dollars of marketing driven revenue versus 70k and 30 and three closed lost opportunities while we a TechTarget have witnessed the evolution from centralized to cross departmental buying teams you'll notice that other trusted resources like SiriusDecisions and Gartner also loudly acknowledge this point too in particularly in today's noisy vendor landscape focusing only on senior or security specific titles is truly limiting in a time of unprecedented demand for effective cyber security technology and results embracing those researching for solutions in your market regardless of title or role give your organization real business results including more paths into deals and better conversions what we do as marketers to adapt to changing market dynamics will make the difference between losing or gaining market share in winning organizations really embrace this approach and when you do you can start to see how you can influence engage and sell to these new buying centers that are cropping up in and around your business opportunity and I have to end by asking ourselves that if the cybersecurity technology that we are selling looks nothing like it did five years ago why do we as marketers continue to market based on legacy approaches activity matters now more than ever thank you and as always feel free to contact me directly if you'd like to hear more about market dynamics that TechTarget monitors to help your business maximize its revenue potential in the meantime stay safe
