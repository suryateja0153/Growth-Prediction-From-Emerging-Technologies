 good morning everybody and thank you for joining today's webinar my name is Nathan Cookson I'm the portfolio manager at Pearson Myra Mayer Pearson is product management responsible for apprenticeships and work-based learning provision within two key sectors appears and one being business which covers the cross sector products for example customer service business administration management and leadership and other products within apprenticeships work based learning and content that covers the generic cross sector areas in addition I also cover the digital sector again apprenticeships and work-based learning provision within that sector thank you for joining today today's webinar is really to talk about sage transition in England only and our particular focus will be on Pearson products and services that will be able they'll be available to support you in that transition from Sasa prentice ships to new standards when we hit that critical date on the 1st of August 2020 and that's correct it's to highlight the various products and services and qualifications that are available to you and both now and from the 1st of August 2010 t22 support you in that transition from frameworks to standards so starting first we're going to cover the business and administration routes you'll see from this presentation that we've classified each of our areas when the the various routes that are covered within the apprenticeship sector so the first one is looking at the business administration routes as you can see here there are three current seis apprenticeship frameworks within the business and administration sector and they are the intermediate level to the advanced at level 3 and the higher apprenticeship in Business and Professional Administration at level 4 you will see from this slide that there there is no replacement standard at level 2 and there is no replacement standard at level 4 and following close dialogue with the employer group and the IFA to the e there is no intention currently to develop a new standard iva level 2 and over level 4 however it's our is our intention at Pearson that we will continue to maintain our level 2 qualification provision and so that they're able to diploma and Business Administration at the same time we also will maintain our level 4 business administration provision whilst that transition takes place currently those qualifications are available to August 2022 it sorry August 2021 and we will review the uptake of those qualifications in terms of learner numbers as we get closer to the to those dates what I would like to highlight is that level - we do have alternative provision both in competency-based qualifications for example the level 2 diploma and also knowledge based qualifications that can be delivered in your course type program and in the future weeks and months we will be doing some marketing and communication to share those products with customers where there is continued provision is at the advanced level apprenticeships and Business Administration so the level 3 framework so there is a replacement standard and it's been around and for a couple years now and that's the business administrator level 3 standard as you'll be aware within the business sector that there are no mandated qualifications in the majority of the new apprenticeship standards however to support customers and apprentices within their own program phase of the apprentice now they'll enter support centers in terms of of delivery we have created two qualifications we've created the Pearson beat level free certificate for business administrators and the Pearson BTEC level 3 diploma for business administrators these are on program optional qualifications that I've designed have been designed to to support that unprogrammed phase and they are available now moving on to the management and leadership sector that also is covered with the business administrative route sighting with the intermediate level 2 apprenticeship level 2 we have the advanced level framework at level 3 we have the higher apprenticeships both at level 4 and level 5 and they're the first four rows on this slide you'll see that there is no replacement provision in terms of new standards at both level 2 and level 4 similarly to Business Administration those qualifications as existing qualifications are due to and be reviewed by the end of August 2021 and we will be undertaking that process shortly to make a decision whether those qualifications will be extended or whether decision is made to retire retire those qualifications but as it currently stands they are still available for learner registrations outside of apprenticeships once we hit that first of August deadline until August 2021 where there is a replacement standard you'll sees at level 3 and I'm sure you're already aware by now that whilst it is a level 3 replacement standard the wording has changed from management to team lead a stroke supervisor and similarly again to Business Administration there is no mandated qualification although the standard ISM highly recommend the undertaking of other on program qualification what Pearson have created is the level 3 certificate for managers and the level 3 diploma for managers for those who are not aware of the differences between the certificate diploma and this is a reoccurring theme for our this entire deck is that certificate targets the the knowledge elements of the apprenticeship standard and some areas of behaviors whereas the the level 3 diplomas or the diplomas at any level where we've created a replacement qualification and the diplomas cover the full apprenticeship standard so they support both the delivery of knowledge but also the assessment and evidence gathering of the skills and the behaviors and as you'll see that for level 3 the team years supervised replacement standard those qualifications are avail now and the standard is available for endpoint assessment through Pearson again at level five you see that there is a replacement it's the operation stroke departmental manager at level five simulator level three we have created those two optional on program qualifications to support the knowledge but also to support the the skills and knowledge and the behaviors together and they are available now nesting at the bottom of this side you'll see that Pearson we do have some provision in seis frameworks and recruitments and in terms of the advanced level apprenticeship which is at level three there is a replacement standard called recruitment consultant Pearson have made a decision to not engage in this area in the going forward so there is no replacement qualification or standard in terms of endpoint assessment that Pearson will be offering those recruitment qualifications so they say the qualifications they have a operational review date of August 2021 so what we will do is we will continue those qualifications until they reach that review date and we'll make a decision at that point in terms of their continued use I think it's quite likely at this stage that the recommendation will be to withdraw those qualifications as we reach August 2021 so that covers the business administration route moving on to sales marketing and procurement so there is provision in terms of customer service at level two and level three so replacing the intermediate level apprenticeship in customer service is the customer service practitioner level two and replacing the advanced level apprenticeship in customer service at level three is the customer service specialist level three standard Pearson are offering endpoint assessment in both of those areas and in addition we have again created the optional qualifications to support that on program phase based in terms of the knowledge but also the knowledge skills and behaviors and you'll see there we have the level 2 certificate for customer service practitioners and the diploma to support the Christmas service practitioner standard and at level three we have the recently published qualification several months ago for customer service specialist both the certificate and the diploma so put them for provision is available now in customer service to transition from say frameworks to replacement standards so moving on to sales marketing and contact centers you see that in terms of level 2 and level 3 provision there are no replacement standards for sales marketing so he sales and contact centers at levels 2 & 3 in terms of marketing there is no replacement at level 2 but there are various options at level 3 so in terms of sales again it's a it's a very similar message at this stage pitten are not engaging in new standards in those areas however the says-- qualifications are due for review at the end of August 2021 so one year after the state's framework registrations close it's our intention to continue those qualifications until we reach August 2021 at which point make a decision whether those qualifications will continue based upon demands and their gain that's the same for contact center operations so there is no replacement standard provision through Pearson but those qualifications should you wish to entertain them as a standalone provision will continue to be available for at least another year and a half in terms of marketing there is no report there is no replacement vision at level 2 in terms of the intermediate level apprenticeship in marketing however there is various and provision available at level 3 and beyond in terms of new apprenticeship standards for peers and we've only engaged at level 3 there is a marketing assistant level 3 apprentices that available but unfortunately person we've not met we we have not decided to engage in that area where we have engaged in terms of replacing level 3 provision is in the digital market here level 3 new apprenticeship standard we are in the process of developing our 10-point assessment materials for that standard and they'll be available by May 20-22 that we have created three on program qualifications and the Pearson level 3 awarding principles of coding the level 3 award in digital marketing business principles and the level 3 award in marketing suppose if you are familiar with a digital market ear standard there is a mandated requirement within that standard that a learner completes three knowledge modules during the unprogrammed phase they can they can do this by either in to taking a specific vendor certificate that aligns to those knowledge modules alternatively making them to take a off quality seed qualification that aligns to those knowledge modules and Pearson we have created those three qualifications that are aligned directly to those my knowledge modules and satisfy the criteria from program achievement and each of those qualifications are assessed via an on screen assessment details can be found on the Pearson website so we have full provision in the digital market here level 3 standard to replace the safe framework in marketing so moving on to the more retail focus standards as it currently stands Pearson have active provisioning frameworks at both level 2 and level 3 for trade supplier and funeral team member and funeral director we've made a decision that we will not be engaging in new standards in each of those areas and identically to the other areas of that we've covered in this webinar the qualification so they say those qualifications that are in the safe framework have a review date of August 2021 and we will continue to offer those qualifications until August 2021 at which point our our decision will be that we withdraw those qualifications and exit from both the trade supplier and the funeral operations and services sector in terms of retail I mean retailer the renew retest that has have been available for a long time to such an extent that the safes frameworks have already been withdrawn so there is provision available in terms of the the level intermediate level 2 apprenticeship and retail and the advanced level 3 apprenticeship and retail in terms of retail level 2 and retail team later level 3 unfortunately Pearson we we've taken the decision very recently that we will be existing the retail sector so there is no replacement qualification or endpoint assessment trick standard available through Pearson although there there are alternative provision out there in the sector and finally covering the business sector is illegal financing and accounting route so currently Pearson offers nice apprenticeship frameworks at level two and the level three and providing financial services and the various pathways within that in those frameworks there are multiple replacement standards available in the financial services sector and the legal sector and the accountancy sector so multiple standards from level 3 all the way to professional level standards at level 7 Pearson again we've made the decision that we will not be engaging in the financial services sector following the withdrawal of seis framework so the providing financial services qualifications will continue until August 2020 so the the whilst the frameworks close from the 1st of August 2020 and there has to be full transition to new standards Pearson's qualifications cease at the end of August 2020 so there'll be one month period where any additional registrations can be made to those qualifications but following the 31st of August 2020 we will be withdrawing providing financial services sector and there'll be no further provision in terms of apprenticeships within this area from Pearson you so moving on to digital in terms of the IT user area so the intermediate apprenticeship for IT application specialists and the Advanced Apprenticeship of IT application specialists there is no replacement standard at level 2 and level 3 that directly replaces the IT application specialist sector the primarily really the prom' primary reason for that is because of the requirement that a new apprentice standard aligns to as a very specific job job occupation and it is deemed that the IT application specialist is not a very specific job application sorry job occupation so therefore there will be no replacement standard to replace those frameworks from the first of August 2020 Pearson's qualifications are due to expire in terms of IT users at the end of December 2020 at this point in time it's our intention to withdraw those qualifications at the end of December 2020 in that we feel there'll be no or very minimal use of those qualifications once the seis frameworks are retired for IT application specialists moving on then to the procom area so I mean there is the intermediate advanced and higher apprenticeship for IT software web and telecom professionals so similar to level 2 in terms of IT application specialists there is no level 2 replacement Digital apprenticeship standard and those qualifications that level 2 program qualification is you to be reviewed at the end of December 2020 however we have had some demand in terms of learner activity outside of apprenticeships are non apprentice learners so it's our intention that whilst the apprenticeship framework will expire from the 1st of August 2020 we will we will extend those qualifications approximately for the further two years to assess the level of demand for those qualifications at level 2 in terms of level 3 and level 4 and beyond the ID the digital sector is very similar to the legal financial accountancy in that there are a vast amount of replacement standards that have been developed aligned to very very specific job roles job occupations have in the digital sector so there are multiple standards available within the digital sector at the current point in time Pearson are not offering endpoint assessment in those new digital standards on the basis that there are some changes occurring in terms of the digital apprenticeship review and the changes to those standards however within many of the replacement standards is a requirement for the achievement of knowledge modules to to be achieved in order to meet the requirements of the unprogrammed phase and what we've done here at Pearson is we've created a number of level 3 and level 4 qualifications that align today's knowledge modules and you'll see in the in the third column here the list of those qualifications I'm not going to I'm not going to go through line by line but similarly to digital marketing what those qualifications do they directly map to the knowledge modules of various digital replacement standards you you I'm sorry about that it seems that we had a audio issue so to continue we have created those knowledge qualifications that map to the knowledge modules and they are all assessed by on-screen tests and achievement of various peers and qualifications meet the knowledge module of each of those standards at level 3 and level 4 alternatively apprentices do and centers do have the option of inter taking vendor certificates at the same purpose so in terms of level 4 and level 3 program we have the we have optional qualifications but at this current stage in time we do not have endpoint assessment available in terms of the existing seis qualifications for level 3 so for the advanced apprenticeship for IT software web and telecom professionals it's our intention to extend that level 3 qualification on the basis that similar to level 2 there is that demand for learner registrations and the need for that qualification outside of apprenticeships so it's our intention that we will extend that qualification for a further two years and when it is due for review at the end of December 2020 we ended December this year and level 4 we will be retiring that qualification so withdrawing that qualification when it when the end of December Rises on the basis that there is minimal learner demand at level 4 for that qualification once the SAF framework expires you so next steps from the first of August 2020 so this is this is essentially just a recap so that works so that the message is absolutely clear so seis apprenticeship frameworks in England argue for withdrawal at the end of July 2020 so from the 1st of August 2020 any new apprenticeship starts will have to be on apprenticeship standards as opposed to those frameworks and just a recap we are only covering England in this webinar frameworks and Wales and Northern Ireland will continue and my recommendation is that you contact your business and development manager or your customer service contact further information around those areas but in terms of a very quick read recap of what new standards are they're written directly by employer led groups often called Trailblazer groups so a group of employers that represent the sector of all sizes from large organisations all the way down to SMEs and what they do is they define the knowledge skills and behaviors that a individual needs to be occupational competent within a specific job roles and what this is allowing is allowing employers to identify those relevant skills knowledge and behaviors and and bringing apprenticeships future-proofing apprenticeships to those skills knowledge and behaviors that industry needs in addition to that it provides apprentices with a clear pathway to progression in terms of further apprenticeships than those job roles or additional groups that apprentice may wish to take those Thunders tend to be one to two pages long and then call pro a high at high level the requirements of the standard supporting that is the assessment plan and what the assessment plan is is it is it provides the framework for endpoint assessment so that independent assessment undertaken by an independent Assessor against those knowledge skills and behaviors that are contained the apprenticeship standard and each of those assessment plans are very much tailored to the requirement of the apprenticeship the minimum duration in terms of apprenticeship is 12 months and and that the maximum duration is determined by the complexity of the job role and those Neels those those knowledge skills and behaviors that need to be acquired learnt and evidence by apprentices but after that period of time endpoint assessment takes place and this is an independent assessment of the achievement of those knowledge skills and behaviors and aligns to the content of this asmin plan it's very different to apprenticeship frameworks whereby and their qualification based and then it's that continuous assessment throughout the apprenticeship program so that still takes place of an apprenticeship standards plus that independent assessment in the end point assessment phase support you with the transition Pearson we do have our apprenticeship webpages and I will click on this link to hopefully it works to show you those are printed pages so here within the person apprentice website you'll be able to access a variety of information downloads videos content and to support you both in apprenticeship frameworks whether that's in England Northern Ireland Wales in addition to at that transition to apprenticeship standards and you'll also to be able

qualifications at Pearson deliver and you'll be able to download the specification if you click the endpoint assessment tab you will be able to download Pearson's endpoint assessment specification for that which contains information around our approach to endpoint assessment and that's available for each of the areas we are engaging with so coming out to that and that wraps up our when I say it was a high-level overview of transitioning from safes to new apprentice standards and the various products are available in each of the sector's within business and digital that peers and support we do
