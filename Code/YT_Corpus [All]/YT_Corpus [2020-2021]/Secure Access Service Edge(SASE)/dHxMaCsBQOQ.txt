 hey everybody thanks for attending this session as part of vmworld 2020. uh this presentation is going to be about remote access and xero trust and how vmware can help you achieve end-to-end security from your users and devices all the way to the applications in your data center and your cloud my name is martin niffen i'm part of the end user computing team working on secure access within the workspace one product portfolio i'll be giving a brief introduction to xero trust and workspace one and then i'll hand it off to amer octor who's put together most of this presentation to talk a little bit more about edge security and security going into the data center and so our goal is that by the end of this you'll have a good idea of xero trust and how vmware can help you achieve some of these security and productivity goals a very brief disclaimer this presentation does have some features that are still under development and so you will not yet see them in the product but we do hope to give you a good idea of what we're building where we're going and what you'll see soon so a brief agenda we'll start off by talking a little bit about xero trust and what our motivators are there and then we'll go into kind of a walk through of security from endpoints all the way to the apps in your data center so i'll talk a little bit about uh our perap vpn that is workspace one tunnel and then i'll hand it off to amer to talk a little bit more about edge security with sd-wan and how this suite of technology kind of brings it all together for a secure solution okay so why xero trust what is actually motivating this i think the first thing to understand is that zero trust is not a particular product it's not exactly a feature rather it's an approach to security and so really we're reacting to a number of different trends that we see in the market and so the first of those is around business transformation and so we see a lot of the ways that that customers are building applications they're they're not just on premise uh or in the cloud or in your own data center uh there's some connectivity um and so we kind of assume that there is always a hybrid barrier where your applications are going to span your network and cloud locations um and so really what this means is there's no longer a concept of a trusted network or being inside the network uh really we can't use that as a as an approach like a castle mode approach um it's just too slow and it doesn't keep up with the context that we really want to be looking at uh second we have a bunch of different types of users and devices so users are no longer just full-time employees there's part-time employees there's contractors there's external workers from other businesses that you're collaborating with and so we have to be really specific about how much access we give each type of user and we also have to be considerate of what types of devices they're actually connecting from uh so these could be corporate issued devices that are managed by it and have very locked down security policies or they could also be byod devices where it belongs to the end user they purchased it themselves and we need to be really privacy centric about how much control or access we're putting on their device and lastly we know that there's a bunch of different types of applications that users are utilizing today so originally we probably had mostly internal applications that were accessed by a vpn or some vdi now there's also web-based applications that are mostly browser-based and some of those apps might have some mobile or native interface that has more rbac built into it or a simplified user experience and so we really need to understand how users want to be productive and make sure that our security policies keep up with this evolving productivity landscape and obviously right now we're all rather sensitive to the constraints that the pandemic has put on us and this has really accelerated the needs for zero trust with everybody working remotely one of the most important things to making sure our businesses stay successful and productive is making sure that they don't have any technology issues so making sure that they have all of the bandwidth they need they have access to the their internal resources and we're not causing any downtime to them being productive and so a lot of our conversations with customers and market research say that there is going to be some work 2.0 initiative for uh most companies where they expect either some hybrid or or partial work from home you know environment for some part of their users you know going forward cool uh so what do we actually mean by xero trust network access and uh one of the other names for this you might have heard of is probably software defined perimeter uh and so really what we're talking about here here is that with xero trust we implicitly deny you access to any application so again just because you're inside the network that doesn't mean that you're actually trusted you need to pass more security posture checks than just that we also want to enforce the principle of least privilege so that means that you only are given access to the resources that you need we're considering your role at the company we're considering the type of device that you have and we're considering what sort of applications and posture that device has and so really we want to match your you know security posture and roll with the right amount of access and so really we need to create different boundaries than the castle and moat wall we need identity-based boundaries around your role we need context-based boundaries around when you normally work and where you're located uh and then logical boundaries uh you know around what you're trying to do with these applications and so in order to enforce this really we need some trust broker and so we'll get into what that trust broker looks like but at a high level the trust broker handles things like authentication and authorization looking at identity both from a user perspective and the device and then we also make sure that we hide these applications from discovery so since you must get pre-authorized to actually use an application that means that the application isn't just sitting there on the internet for any malicious actor to try and probe and get into because they haven't passed those pre-authorization checks cool so let's take a look at workspace 1 tunnel which is part of the workspace 1 suite of productivity applications workspace 1 tunnel is our per-app vpn so it's one of the major ways that customers and end users can access their resources and so on the surface what a user sees is this client on the left and in particular what you'll note is that it is very privacy-centric so we'll see what particular applications are flagged for vpn as well as which domains within that application are being flagged and so this is really important from a privacy perspective and has driven a lot of adoption in response to things like gdpr over in europe as well as california's ccpa which are some of the more stringent privacy rules that we've had so far and so we're trying to make sure that the user always knows what's going on and that nothing is being snooped on without their their visibility and so tunnel is available on all major platforms windows mac os ios and android there's also a mobile sdk sdk if you're building your own internal applications and under the hood there are a number of security enforcements happening one we are building on tls 1.2 or greater cryptography we also have man-in-the-middle prevention so no malicious actor can snoop on the traffic by enforcing ssl pinning and then we also have compliance integration with workspace one so workspace one is cataloging the apps on a device uh you know is the device encrypted does it have a passcode in place uh things like that and so if you violate any workspace one policy uh then we ensure to block your access on the gateway and not give you access to any resources and so in this way we can have a number of different filters we have a user-based filter by saying hey this user is registered in workspace one and entitled to use this service they're on a device that's been approved either by it being a corporate issued device or a particular model or a manufacturer that's trusted it is flagging the application so we're saying hey we explicitly trust chrome we don't trust my home rolled web browser.exe and then we're also saying which explicit domains we're going to be tunneling so we don't want to tunnel any domains that we're not familiar with we're only allowing into the network the the domains that it approves and so in this way we have a pretty good start uh working on the principle of least privilege cool uh so one of the major ways that uh enterprisers are using tunnel is uh to granularly segment their their network traffic uh and so this is really important right now both from the privacy perspective that we talked about as well as the bandwidth perspective so with more companies allowing some amount of work from home it's important not to overload your vpn gateways and so this exercise around split tunneling is is pretty important uh so beyond just your internal resources we can say hey let's uh split off some of the resources to the internet so if you're using salesforce or office 365 or g suite then we can make sure that that bypasses the the corporate network and doesn't consume any bandwidth or if we need to be sensitive from a security perspective we can also make sure that other websites are blocked so making sure that users aren't going to youtube or reddit and either split tunneling those or just blocking them because they violate corporate policy and so in this way we can take multi-purpose applications like a browser and make sure that a multi-purpose app is staying single purposed or with dedicated purposes and then we can also take you know single purpose applications and make sure they stay single purpose so make sure that apps aren't talking to foreign domains and exfiltrating company data or even you know pii of your users so if somehow an application got updated and it started accessing an unknown domain then we'd be able to proactively block that from happening okay so let's take a look at some of the features that are in the pipe that we're working on the first one is an extension of the principle of least privilege and it really revolves around this exercise of defining personas and so this is an interesting conversation that we're having with a lot of our customers about saying hey what what are the personas that you have defined within you know your company and have you gone through that exercise and so this is really about just making sure that users only have access to the resources that they absolutely need so if you're a developer you probably need access to some internal documentation plus the code base for your applications whereas if you are a salesperson you probably need access to the customer database and some other things and so really going through this exercise and defining those personas sculpting out the user groups um and then assigning these people access to just what they need is is really critical and so we'll be able to do that both for user groups as well as different device types so we could say hey if you're using a desktop you have this much ask access uh versus if you're using a kiosk or an ipad or something you have a lesser amount of access or a very specifically defined amount of access and then as an extension of this we'll also be able to scale a user's access based on their risk profile so let's say that they've exhibited some funny behaviors recently or carbon black has picked up on something uh or we see them working outside of their normal hours uh we could say hey these are some anomalous behaviors uh and scale back the access and what resources they have access to so maybe they always have access to the lunch menu but then they lose access to the corporate database of code or customer list another thing we're working on is this concept of continuous authorization or continuous authentication um and really this is in response to limitations around access tokens with like uh saml or kerberos so typically when you're granted access to an application you might be given an authentication token that's good for anywhere from an hour up to 30 days and so the only way to remove access for that user is to wait for that token to expire and so this means that you have a large security risk window that could span multiple weeks where you can't remove access for a user and so instead of waiting for every vendor to expose apis to revoke access tokens instead what we can do is we can take a localized man in the middle approach where we don't necessarily need to backhaul all of the traffic through the network but so long as tunnel is managing the application then we can uh enforce policy on it in real time and so if we see any funny business happen from workspace one via uem or intelligence then we can push a policy down to the tunnel client and restrict access or or fully block access and then also since we have the presence on the device we can also notify the user and help out with self-service and remediation so there's no longer a need for uh them to open up a help desk ticket rather we just notify them hey you've installed this malicious application can you please uninstall it and we'll re-grant your access to your applications and so what's cool is across workspace one we can combine a lot of these technologies for a holistic approach and so really what we're looking at here is the the workspace one architecture uh we have device details and attributes being aggregated within workspace one uem uh we have other advanced attributes being aggregated within workspace one intelligence and so that's combining things like risk scores based on behavior carbon black edr threat data as well as all of our vendors that are part of the trust network and so based on any of these inputs we can actually funnel them in and make different access decisions and so that could be that when you're in good standing we always accept you into the network and give you access to applications or based on your risk we say hey do you mind providing some advanced authentication or do you mind remediating an issue we see on your device with what you have installed or your device has been fully compromised it's been stolen and we don't recognize its location or we've detected that it's been jail broken and we just need to reject all access to it uh and so based on all of these rich inputs uh we we have a complete access system to define uh these parameters of how much access you have and then we can route you to the right uh right resource be it a cloud resource or something that resides in your data center cool so that's everything that we wanted to share from the endpoint side and so if you're more interested in endpoint security i encourage you to look at some of the workspace 1 sessions around security and check out carbon black and intelligence now i'll hand it over to omr to talk a little bit more about edge security and the data center great thanks martin so this is omroctor i'm going to continue the discussion with a quick overview of sd-wan by velocloud so just uh just to sort of set the stage with the different components of the sd-wan system from vmware uh there's three main components let's walk through them uh number one is the what we call the vco the vmware orchestrator so this is basically the management system it's a centralized multi-tenant service that's available through vmware we also offer it for self-deployment on-prem but also to our partners as well now the vco takes care of all the management functions for the entire system so that could be thousands of uh of devices under management under a single customer uh takes care of uh easy onboarding it takes care of uh configuration and maintaining those configurations across you know thousands of flight of sites and things like that it takes care of security policies uh we'll get into that in a little bit and then also uh it takes care of monitoring and uh and these types of things so it's um it's uh quite uh expansive in in its capabilities number two is the velo cloud edge develop cloud edge is think of it as the branch router or uh or a ce or a customer edge type device it sits at the campus edge the brass edge it could be sitting inside the data center there's multiple form factors available to this uh it's a it's available as a virtual appliance so you can deploy it in of course an esxi but also in aws on your kvm you can deploy it in azure and we have those in the marketplace for many of the cloud providers now with respect to uh the edge and of itself we also have uh hardware appliances and there's a variety of those and the difference for them you know a number of interfaces wi-fi capabilities uh ability to host vnfs and things of that nature uh but the major uh difference between them is their uh throughput capacity and things like that now the edges are actually able to talk to each other so if you look at uh you know branch site and uh this other branch site over here they're actually able to create a secure tunnel between them and uh and and this tunnel uh is called dmpo dynamic multi-path optimization and we'll talk a little bit about the in the next couple of slides but it has a number of different capabilities including being able to use multiple uh interfaces so if you have for example two internet connections true broadband links or a mixture of broadband mpls and lte it's able to bring all those together it's able to manage the bandwidth across them it's able to move traffic back and forth between them but one of the most important things that it does one of the most interesting things that it does is it's able to actually do packet recovery so if you lose packets along the path it's actually able to recreate those packets without having to rely on the application layer of doing re-transmissions and what that does is just creates a very uh stable environment even over uh you know over over the public internet infrastructure and and that leads to better application experiences and the like now the edges are able to of course talk to each other directly but we also have a third component called the cloud gateway sometimes referred to as the vcg now what the cloud gateway allows you to be able to do is to provide connectivity uh while using dmpo uh for internet sites for sas things but also additional um shared services like security services and things like that i'll talk about that in the next couple of slides but keep in mind that uh between the edges and the vcgs it is using dmpo so you get the benefits of dmpo the the lost resiliency the aggregated bandwidth pooling and things of that nature not just between your enterprise sites but also for traffic now that's destined towards the sas and we have thousands of these vcgs distributed around the world there's one uh generally somewhere in your neighborhood uh and and the idea over here is actually that you don't you know hairpin your traffic to your data center uh which would have dmp if there was a vc installed over there but you would go directly to a local or regional vcg and from there you would exit directly to the internet or to the sas so let's continue so what i did was actually let's put this against uh like like a customer environment on the right hand side you've got some examples of destinations so bottom right hand side is the enterprise data center and you'll be maybe hosting bdi sessions over there there may be enterprise applications in your data center uh there may be file storage and things of that nature and front ending the data center would be uh would be a vce connected potentially to mps vpn networks or over to the internet also uh you know a lot of enterprise workloads are being hosted within the public cloud or within sas environments and in this particular example uh we've basically said that to get to those you can go through a vcg again getting the benefits of dmpo so we'll come back to that in a little bit and of course there's uh the potential of sending your traffic directly into the internet from the edge and of itself of course you could choose to send these through dmpo but sometimes generally they're not uh not business related so sometimes you don't uh want to actually uh you know throw dmpo at that particular set of problems now on the left hand side are where the users are so we've got uh you know the campus environments or the branch environments but we've also recently added capability for home environments as well all front-ended by a bce now the vc of course uses dmpo to get from the branches to other branches from branches to the data center and then from the branch over to the vcg protecting uh that traffic that's destined towards the is or towards sas and and the like now uh in this session we'll talk a little bit uh in the next couple of slides afterwards after this uh velocloud session we'll also talk about the remote users and uh martin sort of started talking about the workspace one capability we'll talk about how these remote users are actually now it's possible for them to be integrated into the sd-wan fabric so they're actually terminate in the cloud and they're able to make use of dmpo and the tunnel fabric the dmpo and the sd1 fabric to make their way down into the enterprise resources whether they be in the data center and the branch or potentially even if you have a file server sitting at your home or you're trying to get to a remote desktop session in your home all those are actually possible through this remote users because the users are actually getting integrated into the sd-wan fabric and of itself now the the final thing i wanted to talk about is the security infrastructure that's built into the sd-wan so we do have a number of security facilities within the vce and of itself so there's a stateful firewall that's built in there we're able to do uh fqdn based filtering we're able to classify over 3000 different applications generally that's used for like a qos uh type of qs or a traffic steering type policy but you can actually use aspects of that for blocking certain sites and things that nature or certain types of applications of those types of things now the final security capability that's built in uh to the vce in fact into the actual sd-wan fabric is this idea of end-to-end segmentation or routing domains so uh now from a management perspective this tenancy this enterprise is managed within a single tenant account within vco and we have multiple levels you know from operator and those types of things but in addition to that within that customer tenancy you can actually have multiple segments and what that really relates back down to is multiple routing domains so you can actually have a guest segment a lot of times the guest segment basically just terminates right at the vce itself and the guest basically uh you know exit directly over to the internet so think about a retail case where people join uh the guest segment and they're able to go directly out to the internet or you may have a pci segment where that traffic is basically kept completely segregated end to end from one edge all the way to the data center uh completely segregated from other sets of traffic and whatnot and you can have you know other types of segments as well but it's really up to how the system is configured and how the enterprise data center layouts are done and we'll talk a little bit about that on the when we get to the nsx or the data center side of things cool now finally um let's talk a little bit about dmpo so dmpo dynamic multi-path optimization so this is the tunneling protocol in between the edges so you could have a vce talking to another vce directly and dmpo would be used over there and you can also have edges talking vces talking to the gateway to the vcg now that is also using dmpo and of course dmpo does implement that segmentation that we talked about but it has a number of different types of capabilities um let's start with the fact that it's actually able to do continuous monitoring so every single packet that is sent out over the link is instrumented we're able to uh understand that the packet was lost uh the latency that was incurred for that particular packet so we're continuously monitoring the traffic that's going through these dmpo uh through the dmpo tunnels so that's one we use that continuous monitoring to be able to measure the performance of the underlying link and we can use that to be able to move traffic back and forth between different links if we have for example latency sentence sensitive traffic like voice we can put that onto a lower uh to a lower latency path another aspect of dmpo is that it's able to bundle or bond together multiple underlay links that you might have so if you have multiple say dsl or broadband or lte connections coming into a single vce the vce is actually able to bond these together and it's actually different than other forms of load sharing that's out there for example if you're familiar with equal cost multipath ecmp that basically takes an individual flow and it maps it to one of those links and unfortunately if that individual flow is bigger than that link you will start dropping packets what dmpo does is actually something very different it actually stripes packets of a flow across as many of the links as it can and what that allows you to be able to do is actually push more traffic against the entire capable bandwidth that's available coming into that vce from the uplinks itself now one of the most interesting things about dmpo is its ability to be able to recover uh from uh from packet loss so if you have uh for example a percentage of packets being lost we're able to actually uh from the continuous link monitoring were able to understand that there was packet loss first of all and we're actually able to recreate those packets on the on the edge of that link now think about uh as you're taught as you're sending your traffic over the internet from your branch to the data center and you know two percent three percent of your uh packets are being lost uh there is no need for re-transmission what the what the dmpo protocol is able to do on the far edge at the data center it's able to recover those packets as if they were never lost so what that does is increases your throughput it increases the quality of the connection of course the user experience from a network application perspective is also increased now i just use the example of vce to vce branch to data center but this actually applies to bce to bcg traffic as well so think about improving the quality and the performance of the traffic for traffic that's destined over to uh to sas uh applications like salesforce to office 365. in fact we made measurements where we can actually improve the performance of uh of connectivity to for example sharepoint and and uh and one drive by five times by making use of this vce and the shared service of the vcgs that we offer to our customers all right let's keep going uh so that's uh what was a summary a very quick summary of the sd-wan system from vmware now i'm going to look at one specific aspect of security within the data center uh really focusing on the zero trust type principles and sort of uh align that to what we're going to be talking about as the remote access and zero trust thing comes together now if you look at your data center if you just had freestanding uh uh jobs sort of sitting out over there um uh what there really is no distinction from a security perspective or at least from an enforcement perspective and really what happens is is that if one of these systems gets compromises potentially many of these systems could actually get compromised by by way of lateral movement so for example if the vm on the left-hand side was somehow compromised it would have access to the to the other vms or at least the network that connects those other vms and it would actually potentially make lateral movement a whole lot easier now one thing that can be done is with the nsx uh uh segmentation system we're able to actually put a virtual firewall around every single one of these vms and what that does is it prevents uh arbitrary uh folks even from within the data center uh from being able to reach that vm unless they match particular criterias and policies and those policies could actually cover a number of different attributes of that these vms are somehow related for example they're all part of the pci domain that they can actually talk to each other or there have different application attributes or user context and things of that nature and what that allows you to be able to do is to create these segments micro segments as well as macro segments and and to be able to uh prevent basically people from moving across these different segments you're able to localize if there was an attack of some sort uh it actually gets localized to one of least privilege and uh okay so that's actually available within the nsx system within the data center and how that relates back to velocloud is that we are able to take the velo cloud segments that we talked about so remember within a single tenancy we have we can actually create a number of different segments for example a corporate one a guest one a pci one and this is basically enabled end to end within the sd1 fabric and then that fabric as it gets into the data center can map into the nsx routing domain so that would be the top sort of uh it's probably not the right term with the uh the presentation layer or the access layer at the top of the data center which would then map to the individual sort of segments that are backed by within that particular application so the velocloud segmentation system can actually map to the front end of the segmentation environments that nsx is actually offering now let's take that back to well what are our deployment options as far as remote access are concerned uh if you were to look at you know how this is done in the world today and if you look at the general market you would basically have you know a few vpn gateways probably situated within your data center and the the care and feeding of this vpn gateway would be really the responsibility of the it team so they would be responsible for designing the reliability the elasticity the scalability any kind of high availability type things for that particular vpn gateway and also how that vpn gateway maps you know across different regions or you may have to create different vpn or deploy i'm sorry different vpn gateways across the different regions to be able to uh do you know site-wide reliability and things of that nature so that's for the it team then there's challenges for the users themselves so imagine users are basically now coming in over the internet they're going to make their way uh towards that network link to the data center terminate their traffic on the vpn gateway hopefully has enough space for them especially you know with covet and everything there has been a lot more stress onto the vpn gateways themselves and let's say they are able to terminate that traffic and now their eventual destination was actually an is uh system or a sas environment so what they're now have to do is basically now fight their way out of the data center across that purple line again to make their way towards the sas and what that does is this particular system from a user experience perspective it definitely adds more latency because now you're hair pinning your traffic down to the data center but the other thing that it does is it um it actually increases the probability that you're actually might be losing traffic especially if that link down to the data center is uh so it's basically more surface area for you to actually lose packets and things of that nature and and coupled with the challenges against the itt team now one thing that you can do so martin turtle talked about this is you can actually uh deploy uh workspace one uh uag within the data center and what that allows you to be able to do is of course now the it team is actually still responsible for the care and feeding of the of the uag elasticity those types of things but one of the things that's beneficial for the remote access user is you can actually create policies that allow your traffic to exit basically directly into the sas environments and and the like [Music] so really split tunneling from the end system and of itself so there is a potential of reducing the hair pinning but then the enterprise actually has no sort of view of what's going on with that particular set of traffic and the like so that's one deployment model now one thing that we released back in june is we took that concept of the uag within the data center and we virtualized it and we spread it across the vmware sd-wan pop so this would be the same pops that where the vcgs are so very close to the vcgs themselves so when the users come in they're actually able to terminate onto this virtual uag service and from here we also offer a cloud-based firewall and traffic steering policy so rather than having the users basically exit directly at the end system we can actually have them exit at uh at the pop now we get additional visibility into that traffic we can actually protect it uh from a firewalling perspective things of that nature and we can actually uh sequence in cloud security so if you have a third party uh what we call within uh vmware sd-wan uh cws so cloud web security uh we're able to actually sequence those in as well to get that additional level of protection for the mdm uh for these remote access users i'll talk a little bit about the mdnvpn in some upcoming slides uh right so with the uag service or the vpn concentrator now being hosted by vmware within the sd-wan system we're able to alleviate the care and feeding or the operational cost for the it team which previously had to host and take care of that vpn concentrator within the data center now an additional improvement on that one is if you were to couple the sd-wan uh system uh the dmpo the any to any connectivity from being able to you know go from any branch to any branch from being able to go from uh and have your traffic be protected by dmpo so that is the final sort of integration so that's also available today um and what you can do in that particular case is now the user basically comes in uh they're able to terminate their traffic onto the sd-wan uh hosted uag and uh they're able to you know have their traffic go off you know through that cloud firewall we talked about into sas inter-internet but when now they are bringing their traffic down to the data center they have the full protections of dmpo those application improvements that we talked about or those network improvements that we talked about but also the ability of being able to go from anywhere to anywhere so that means is rather than having to have your traffic let's say you were trying to go to this branch on the left hand side in the previous slide where we were talking about uh you know how having the user terminate their traffic on the uag and they would come down into the data center over an ipsec tunnel and then they would basically then switch networks and then go over perhaps an mps vpn network from the data center into their branch site now if we were to couple that if the customer were to couple that with the sd-wan system then that type of hair pinning for enterprise traffic destined outside of the data center would not need to happen so in that particular case the the vpn user would come into the uh into the vpn concentrator hosted by vmware in our pops they would have access to the sd1 fabric so rather than and let's say their eventual destination was this branch on the left hand side so rather than having their traffic go down to the data center and then go to the branch site they would just go directly to the branch site and of itself and and what that does is in this particular final scenario uh the user is uh unless they absolutely have to go down to a particular enterprise site uh they will not go down there right so there's no unnecessary traffic being sent down to a data center there's no uh traffic being sent uh to a data center again if it was destined for the sas you can actually have that traffic exit directly from the pop and go over to sas or internet or a cloud security framework if you like now i just i was going to come back to the different user types so what is available right now is on the right hand side so this is basically on the client side would be an mdm so this is workspace one so workspace one advanced and enterprise have a capability that is called tunnel service and that tunnel service is able to be terminated onto the velo cloud or the vmware pops where that vpn concentrator is so this gives you that zero trust next gen vpn as a hosted service provided by vmware you get all the benefits of mdm and uem that are coming in from workspace one so you can lock down the device you can push new applications down to it so it's a very controlled uh end system experience for the users themselves so both from an it management perspective but also from a security and locking the device down perspective as an add-on you can add on um on top of workspace one carbon black for endpoint protection and advanced threat protection and that actually integrates back into workspace one intelligence like martin had talked about now this particular case would be we think it's best suited for an enterprise-owned device because it's being managed by the enterprise and it really provides a high level of security as well as management now on the left hand side is something that uh it's in beta right now we're hoping to get this out by early next year and really what it is is it's the same back-end technology for zero trust next-gen vpn as is on the right-hand side with workspace 1mdm but this is i would say a more stripped down experience uh that is really focused on just the vpn aspects in of itself and you can of course still add on the carbon black uh capabilities uh of course you can of course add on the mdm but at that point you're at the right hand side with the workspace one advanced or enterprise now this particular scenario would be best suited for excuse me this particular scenario would be best suited for cases where that level of management is not desired perhaps by the end user it could be an enterprise a non-enterprise device byod if you will or there's an alternate mdm and really what it offers is a because of the previous capabilities coming in from the right hand side with the mdm it does still retain a low level of device manageability but it is not an mdm uh uem type experience on the left-hand side and and again this would be more applicable for a byod type scenario now let's try to bring this all together in terms of the different uh capabilities that are going on the pop we talked about the gateways this is the vcgs so this has been a historical thing from velocloud we're continuing to invest in the gateway technology and expanding the gateway presence across the world we have added the secure access capability so that's what i talked about in the last couple of slides in terms of uh remote use remote access users being able to terminate uh onto the velocloud pops the vmware sassy pops and uh and to be integrated into the sd-wan and of itself and that brings in from the workspace one side uh the aspects of zero trust of being able to tie together identity context and uh allow list of applications and the like so let me step back a little bit i think i jumped a little bit too quickly into this particular slide so on the right hand side are the destinations that we had talked about so this would be the enterprise data center it would be the uh you know the sas applications like office 365 and salesforce uh but also uh you know dust you know internet destinations like netflix and things of that nature now the other thing is on the left hand side are the different sources of the applications themselves so in this case uh you know traditionally veloclud has really been for the you know the the branch the campus the data center type environments and that's what you see on the left hand side and the and that's really you know on the front end of that would be a vce we've also recently added capabilities to make a vce deployed within the home environment more acceptable for example we've added privacy capabilities so the enterprise would not be getting information about you know your household members what you know what what sites are they going to and how they're using the internet access and things of that nature so there's a privacy element but there's also stronger identity components of being able to identify uh which member of the household is trying to get access into the enterprise network and to be able to control that now with the secure access capability that we lost a few uh weeks back we are now able to have a software-based access into the sd-wan and of itself so this is that zero trust remote access capability called secure access and that's initially making use of uh i'm not sure why it really it really wants to go to the next slide and what we're really able to do with that is make use of the excellent work that's been going on with tunnel service and with workspace one and we're going to make that uh in the next several quarters we're going to make that a lot easier and simpler uh with just sort of a focused answer just on vpn of itself and of course the mdn one will continue to be there now several other things that we're looking at so if you look at this particular diagram of the sassy pop the idea over here is to allow the enterprise administrator to have an easy way to be able to deploy advanced security technologies for a range of different access methods of users that are coming into the enterprise network or making use of the enterprise resources so those users now with the left two boxes we've covered vce uh originated traffic coming in from the from the branch we've covered uh remote access users coming in through secure access and what the security services that we will have are are two-fold so on the top right hand corner corner is uh cloud web security and what that's able to do is basically provide uh security enforcement for traffic that's actually destined out to the internet and that type of enforcement would be for example euro filtering anti-malware casby and and these types of functions so being able to basically uh lock down uh the experience uh to uh uh to sort of quote-unquote you know url categorized good sites and and also be able to sort of inspect the traffic for anti-malware and the like now on the bottom right hand side is uh nsx cloud firewall so we are integrating uh the nsx firewall capabilities into these next generation pops from vmware and what we're able to do is for internal destined traffic so traffic that's going for example branch to branch or going from branch to data center or from remote access into the aws or is type of environments we're able to provide an additional level of security for example anti-malware custom url filtering and an additional levels of security in that particular area now a couple of things on the sassy idea and of itself this is all managed under the vco so it's a single management interface at the end of the day that's our target uh and all the security policies are basically uh run out of the vco and then we push it down to the to the individual services and this is a distributed system again keep in mind we already have thousands of gateways distributed around the world this would be actually expanding that capability of of those pops to include these security services uh enforced in a in a very distributed way so be on the lookout for those capabilities over the next several quarters being rolled out into the vmware sd-wan system now a couple of main takeaways as we wrap up the session today uh we've talked about uh you know the challenges that are there for uh uh for um for free for remote access users for the changing environment of the applications themselves as they're moving from the data center into the sas environments into ios environments and really a change is needed from the wan network and of itself to cut out the hair pinning to make that traffic more efficient to be able to make use of and provide a much more stable and performance optipines network over your basic internet service so that's the transition that's going on with sd-wan on the one side and of itself now in addition to that there is a need to actually implement security at every level so on the end system we talked about workspace one there's also the carbon black capabilities and also inside the network and of itself so traditionally this has been done within the data center and what we're doing with the sassy pops is taking that capability which is very complex to deploy and integrate and test and manage with by the enterprise within the data center i basically offer it as a service in our distributed regional pops at a global level so it's a lot easier to actually have them uh be coordinated out of the vco the management interface for vmware sd-wan and uh have this uh have the security policies basically be implemented on the traffic as they are traveling on their way to the destination whether that be to within the enterprise or that be to various points across the internet in sas or uh or in the ias environments themselves and really what we're trying to do over here is to uh really lean into this next generation application architecture but also the next generation network architecture that needs to be able to address both performance and security needs as these changes are occurring now resources there's a number of labs that we have so there's if you're not familiar with the hands-on lab system from uh from vmware we've got fellow cloud lab uh lightning labs uh various sorts over there there's also workspace one uem labs uh with the uag there is a sort of a sort of a journey map of training on the uag and of itself and there's lots of resources on secure access online we do have trials available both for bellow cloud as well as for workspace one they're initiated by the web using the urls on the right-hand side now coming back to vcn there are a number of sessions as well as hands-on labs to get more familiar with what is capable from vcn on vmworld and of itself in the 2020 catalog and thank you for your time now please do fill out your survey we take a close look at the responses themselves in an effort to improve both the content but also answer additional questions thank you so much
