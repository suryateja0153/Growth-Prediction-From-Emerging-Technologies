 from around the globe it's thecube with digital coverage of next level network experience event brought to you by infoblox hello welcome back to our coverage thecube i'm john furrier your host we're here with a virtual event with info blocks on next level networking it's a virtual event hosted with the cube we have a great guest kaneya vasuni who is the evp of products and corporate development with infoblox can thank you for coming on appreciate it my pleasure john you guys are the theme of this is next level networking which i love next level it it really kind of illustrates we are going to the next level with covet 19 we're seeing it everywhere security dns topic that most people aren't familiar with but in it you know all about it you guys are leading and reinventing ddi for the folks that want to know what that is that's dns dhcp and ip address management for the hybrid cloud and borderless enterprise which is basically everything now this is super super important as we see every single company living this right now which is work forces working from home places that are transforming the surface area is huge you still got to connect to the internet you still need to go to websites you need to do e-commerce you need to run your business this is a huge huge problem that's been highlighted secure access there you guys are in the forefront for next-gen networking tell us what you define as next level so um john i think some of one of the things you will see is if you if you look at the trends happening in our business right there is there is an increasing adoption of sas services whether it's infrastructure as a service being consumed from aws azure or google or all the it applications moving into sas so you you're already seeing a shift away from this data center being the center of the universe in the in the enterprise i.t infrastructure to more of a cloud edge world where a lot of the applications now sit in the cloud some in your private cloud still but a lot in the public cloud and and then you have your enterprise edge from where you want to get to these applications directly instead of backhauling all the traffic into your traditional sort of data center we are also seeing a big push into the number of devices coming into the infrastructure whether it's byod iot 5g so more devices coming into the infrastructure as you said that perimeter and the surface area of the enterprise has exploded so you have to tell you have to start to think about security from a different standpoint so all these trends are starting to play out in in the market i think what you're going to see is over the next couple of years the the the the network inside the enterprise is going to look very different from what it is today today everything gets back called to the data center and that's where all the action is i think what you're going to see is a big shift towards what we call a hybrid multi-cloud enterprise where you may have some workload sitting in your data center some workloads sitting in public clouds some in your private cloud and then you want the ability to move these workloads around you're virtualizing everything all your applications you are actually containerizing all your applications and you want all this stuff to to move around so it poses a very very interesting challenge and that's why we say you need a next level network experience to deal with all the changes that you that enterprises are going through right now that's a great point this is our top story that we've been reporting for a long time but most recently with covet 19 this notion of multiple networks multiple environments multiple clouds certainly hybrid cloud has been ratified everyone pretty much acknowledges that cloud operations on premises to the cloud are there but you got to still move packets from a to b move them around and now you're storing them and all kinds of things are happening but i want to get your thoughts on a trend that even makes what you just said even more complex because the complexity is crazy right now there's a trend of managed services as cloud explosion comes on you mentioned sas more companies are deploying managed services sometimes multi-tenants sometimes pure instances in the cloud or on-premises in a data center that's causing access so i still want to integrate that into a web presence so you know i got to integrate all these things it's not that easy now again dns has been a big part of the web presence but now you have a new dimension of hosted applications you have managed services that are easy to stand up but now i got to integrate them this is one of the hardest challenges that we're hearing i want to get your thoughts and reaction to that yeah and i think uh kobet has certainly accelerated that the shift that we talked about so i think good point there in terms of just covered acting as a big accelerant in in terms of the shift to the cloud i think one of the the key role that we play as the enterprise gets much more dynamic is is you need three elements you need the element to be to get visibility into everything that's going on in your infrastructure you need to provide a layer of security a foundational layer of security in your infrastructure and you need automation because when you have workloads moving around you need to automate all your itsm workflows around allocating ip addresses to these vms or containers uh and moving as containers move around reclaiming ip addresses assigning new ip addresses managing dns records for them so the the work we do the ddi layer really becomes the lifeblood of how this hybrid multi-cloud enterprise comes along and as you get to a much more distributed i.t infrastructure you are not going to be able to manage this entire infrastructure yourself the traditional way right so if you are an enterprise id administrator you cannot sit there and say look i'm going to do the traditional model of deploying software on premise or appliances on premise and i will have id guys going out there and managing the administration of that software and every six months i have to do a software upgrade and i'll do all that what you need because the enterprise has become so distributed and dynamic is you need a a cloud managed paradigm or a managed services paradigm right in either case basically what you see what you're looking at is a centralized management model and the ability to sort of spin up and tear down these services dynamically we are strong believers in sas or a cloud managed approach and a cloud native architecture being the right architecture for the next level network and that is something from a delivery standpoint an msp can use a managed services provider can leverage this cloud managed architecture that we have to offer these services to enterprise customers and take away the whole headache of managing and administering their own infrastructure i like how you said ddi layer because there's an abstraction you can create that take away that complexity that was pretty straightforward in the past you had dns dhcp ip ip addresses okay you manage those spaces no problem naming what not now you have a dynamic environment that's key i want to get back to and follow up what you said about the it folks your customers and the enterprise they're sitting there saying hey i'm used to the on-premises world and i have cloud what's the difference in your mind between on-premises and cloud-managed ddi and why does it matter look i think in the traditional world all the it infrastructure right again was was sitting in one or more regional or or regional or centralized data centers and that that it was easy to manage you could you could deploy appliances from infoblox and uh and it was easy to sort of you had it folks sitting in these data centers and and they could manage the the entire infrastructure uh using some on-premise management tools and and things of that nature but now think about it if you are if you're a walmart and you have 12 500 store right now if you want to push dns dhcp ip address management software into all these 12 500 locations it is very difficult to do that uh by deploying individual appliances or by deploying uh sort of uh shrink wrap software that has to sit in every every one of these locations it's just from an i.t administration standpoint itself it's a much heavier lift but if i could take all the management and all the policy management the policy framework and pull that up into a sas cloud that you can access from anywhere on the on the planet and i'll leave the protocol serving engines if you will on premise so you have a container that gets spun up that can sit on any third-party hardware that's sitting at your infrastructure but it is all managed through the cloud it's zero touch provision uh and and completely orchestrated now you're sitting at us at a central dashboard and if you're in a covered environment you're sitting at home and just accessing our sas service and managing your entire infrastructure from uh from from your from your home from your couch at your home right so it just becomes so much easier for idea administrators to to to operate and and and run such a network they'll have so much free time on their hands they'll be able to watch this virtual event so it'll be fun they're sitting there doing that dashboard that's a great point i want to get your thoughts because i like how you um first of all i love the term next level anything going the next level has been something that you talk about whether you're you're a technical person or an entrepreneur or a business person let's go the next level it means go to the next level but you add the word experience in there and i want to get your thoughts on that because it is about the user experience what do you guys do to provide that what does infoblox provide specifically to provide that next level experience yeah that's a great question we are firm believers again that the future of networking and security in in it is going to shift to a cloud managed cloud native paradigm right which means you should be able to just like the hyperscalers the aws is the googles and the azures of the world right if you look at how they build out their cloud infrastructure it's all about separating the infrastructure layers of the compute layer from the applications that sit on top of them so the compute nodes can scale at a difference at a different pace from that from the applications that same mindset needs to come into into managing networking and security services as well so uh if you have a thousand different edge locations let's say right you can decide through a centralized policy framework what services you want to spin up at all these thousand locations now today you would have to buy a box a small medium large box from infoblox or any one of the networking guys out there and you would have to deploy that and most likely you will end up over provisioning each site because you don't want to run out of capacity the next level experience would say look just tell me what sites you want to deploy the sites will call home they will download the number of services needed based on some centralized policy that was defined and you would get a right size deployment of services at that particular site you need more services because say the user profile the the profile of the users at that site changed which means you need to spin up let's say a couple of additional security services well that gets automatically pulled from the cloud and gets instantiated in that particular site if you need more capacity because it's end of the quarter and you're doing a whole bunch of some financial transactions for closing the books you need more capacity for some of the security applications those additional containers with those security applications can get spun up so you are starting to scale out as you need and scale back when you don't need the capacity but this whole thing becomes a very dynamic experience in terms of how services get spun up they get torn down and it's all driven by this this whole notion of the users that are sitting at a location the context of the user so what devices they are trying to access these applications from what uh what what is the time of the day uh how is the security profile of that device you bring all that know-how into the the how services get provisioned and how services get uh operationalized at any particular site in any particular enterprise right so very simple experience when it comes to networking and security and how do you deploy that scale and the and the thing that that sets up is what you were saying earlier about automation because once you're in this mode and this experience the environment lends itself well to automation because it is downloading the right services you need but since it's dynamic and it needs to be ready how does automation fit into that piece absolutely right right if it is sas managed it is already automated for you and now if you wanted to drive further automation and orchestration through integration with your devops secops net ops tools we have public apis uh through which you this this can be driven so two ways to to manage this right we have a cloud services portal so if somebody wanted to go in and leverage our portal to manage their infrastructure they can do that if they wanted this to be completely programmatic and driven through their their devops secops tools uh then through the public apis we will tightly integrate into all the the tools they have whether it's ansible terraform some of the devops tools or on the security side if you wanted to integrate us into your solar platform security orchestration platforms you can do that and and your entire workflow for networking as well as security can be completely uh completely automated that's awesome i want to get as we get a little bit of time left i know you got to go and we have to hard stop with the segment here customer example obviously customers have a need for this you're in business to do this can you give an example of a customer that kind of illustrates the next level networking we have we have 6000 plus active customers uh we have uh over 50 share when it comes to this dns dhcp ipam uh market so you will see us deployed and we are deployed in 95 out of the fortune 100 enterprises right so infoblox is some someone you will see in any customer that you that you go through we have some public references such as adobe a great customer of ours on our website right they their entire global network runs on the foundational layer of ddi we have some very large customers that are not as comfortable have been public references but we have again if you have 95 of the fortune 100 enterprises running you you can imagine how sticky we are and how broadly deployed we are typically what happens is we would go in and we would go in as the ddi layer for them to control and manage their ip address space and their dns in in the infrastructure then they take on more of a they take on a security lens at this and say look through dhcp and ipam i know everything that is sitting in my infrastructure and through dns i have full visibility into all the communication happening from that endpoint so that's a great data source for me to leverage to as a first layer of defense from a security standpoint so then they start to bring in security into the in into the mix in terms of how they they leverage our product and then through our sas platforms and sas offerings they take that and extend it as they are driving this edge transformation so they push these services now to the edge of the infrastructure so and that the the new infrared the the new offerings uh our blocks one platform is our sas platform and and blocks one base applications are our new offerings uh that that integrates very nicely with some of our traditional offerings so you get a very comprehensive single pane of glass in terms of how you can manage your entire enterprise footprint whether it's it's on-prem at the edge in the public cloud at the cloud edge right all right you know having a good business model that puts abstractions and reduces complexities is a great one we've seen the innovation with dns and anything that needs an internet address you got to connect then iot only creates more need for connections this is the key enterprises no dns they know what they're familiar with it it's the plumbing we all know but every time there's an innovation inflection point a new abstraction layer emerges for simplicity ease of use dns is the phone book of the enterprise of the internet right so you want to call anywhere you have to first do a dns lookup and you brought up iot that's a great example you're not going to be able to put in these iot sensors you're not going to be able to put endpoint security software but they are going to call home so you can leverage dns and do some behavioral analysis of the dns traffic coming out of those iot sensors or iot endpoints and say hey look is there something malicious going on why is my thermostat talking to a server in china well yeah you can detect that through a dns based security layer that is foundational and to your point whether it's a light bulb or anything on that's a device they're being turned on and turned off all the time at massive scale there's no other way to handle it but having abstraction and automation absolutely thank you very much thank you very much for your time great segment we're here at the infoblox virtual event this is thecube coverage i'm john furrier thanks for watching thank you john you
