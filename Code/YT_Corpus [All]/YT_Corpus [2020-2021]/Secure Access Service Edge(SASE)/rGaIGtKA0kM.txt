 Hello everyone. Welcome back another IEI premier Internet is an important invention of humankind Networking appliances are essential for enterprises They include basic devices such as router, WAN and also include network security such as firewall and antivirus software How to maintain and manage these various appliances properly is a big problem for enterprises not to mention the overall expenditure Now, a perfect network appliance, IEI’s PUZZLE series is created to be your best choice for network management First, let me explain why we name it “PUZZLE” It is because, just like a puzzle all the applications mentioned above can be put together into a PUZZLE system by using NFV, Network Functions Virtualization The uCPE can prevent service providers and their customers from suffering hardware vendor lock-in It creates the flexibility of manageability through NFV It also reduces the consumption of CapEx and OpEx including management time and effort Instead of using several physical network appliances uCPE can run several VNFs to build up a network environment which can save lots of energy Its support of open source software enables operators to accelerate time to market and reduce the risk of vender-lockin By combining proprietary software a new variety of innovative services can be developed and delivered Our PUZZLE series is an AI hardware ready system ideal for deep learning and inference computing They support graphics cards Intel FPGA acceleration card and Intel VPU acceleration card to provide additional computational power and end-to-end solution to help run your tasks more efficiently Along with NVIDIA TensorRT, QNAP QuAI and Intel OpenVINO AI development toolkit it can help you deploy your solutions faster than ever In a virtual CPE (vCPE) model all the network functions which mentioned in the slide can be consolidated using software-based virtual network functions (VNFs) running on top of a single universal CPE (uCPE) appliance The VNFs may reside inside an onsite hardware device in an enterprise data center, or in the cloud Both businesses and service providers can operate IEI PUZZLE series easily The PUZZLE series is about the uCPE consisting of virtual network functions (VNFs) running on a standard operating system hosted on an open server An ideal uCPE deployment supports multi-vendor and multi-component architecture and enables rapid development as well as multi-vendor systems The PUZZLE system can provide an open uCPE solution that offers real-time SD-WAN services and supports both Intel x86 and ARM architectures without any additional VNF services The following picture shows the essential components of the PUZZLE series Choose the right components from CPU, NIC, software and put them together to create a network appliance that most meets your needs As for the software, IEI will help customers to get device drivers, applications, NFV software DPDK, OvS, VPP, OpenDaylight and OpenStack IEI will also help customers to deploy and install all of the software and build up their own NFV solutions As for the NIC & Bandwidth IEI provides NIC from four branded companies including Aquantia, Intel, Broadcom and Mellanox and with different speed 1G, 2.5G, 5G, 10G, 25G or 100G As for the System Integration IEI implements 5 major CPU brands including Intel, AMD, Marvell, NXP, and Cavium and 3 kinds of accelerator cards for edge computing or AI computing In terms of software NIC, bandwidth, and system integration IEI can provide you with different solutions to satisfy your demand on creating a perfect networking appliance This is the introduction of networking solution If you like our video, please like and share this video If you want to know more about networking solution please scan the QR-code on the right The most important thing don't forget IEI premiere every Tuesday I hope I can see you next time, bye bye
