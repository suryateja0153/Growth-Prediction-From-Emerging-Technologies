 hiding is the best defense in networking at least [Music] traditional enterprise network architectures separate an internal network from the outside world with fixed perimeters like firewalls but fixed perimeter models still fall short on security lacking protection against phishing attacks untrusted access inside the perimeter extension of the perimeter into the internet and other threats as the name suggests a software defined perimeter or sdp establishes a perimeter via software not hardware which hides an organization's infrastructure from outsiders this approach is sometimes called black cloud because it cloaks systems within the virtual perimeter an sdp controls resource access based on identity it authenticates and authorizes users and endpoints attempting to access a given infrastructure before securely connecting to isolated services using the principle of least privilege to grant only the access necessary to perform the task at hand sdps lower the chances of successful network threats including denial of service attacks man-in-the-middle attacks brute force attacks port scanning server vulnerabilities and lateral movement attacks other benefits include stp's ability to support a variety of devices restrict broad network access support a broad risk-based policy enable control of services applications and access isolate mission-critical applications and data and secure hybrid and private clouds among others stp tools can also be used to complement vpn infrastructures vpns are particularly vulnerable to credential theft and excessive access and an stb can help admins deploy microperimeters for fine-grained user access similarly stp and xero trust models can be deployed in tandem stp cloaks a network and its resources while zero trust upholds authentication measures dive deeper into the differences between stp vpn and xero trust networks by clicking on the link above or in the description box below what benefits would your organization reap from implementing an sdp let us know in the comments and be sure to hit that like button [Music] you
