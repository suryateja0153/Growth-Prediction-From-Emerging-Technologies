 could ztna replace vpns maybe but for good reason [Music] xerotrust network access or ztna is an identity-based security model not a specific product so it can be implemented different ways and offer multiple benefits as cloud migration and remote work accelerate and with new and constant data privacy regulations ztna's flexible deployment can equip enterprises for the future of network security here's how ztna assumes all devices and users whether inside or outside a network are untrusted only after identity is verified by a trust broker does ztna establish trust and provide access this process is context-based security teams grant access to applications and data based on the principle of least privilege ztna treats the internet as an untrusted point of access direct internet access whether on-premise through vpn or cloud-based exposes ip addresses which can leave users or resources open to attack with ztna iot and end-user device ip addresses are hidden which reduces the attack surface and enables more secure remote access ztna can identify malicious or unusual behavior for example it flags attempts to access restricted resources or download massive quantities of data ztna provides centralized control to act on these behaviors and better secure perimeter-less distributed i.t environments ztna can be deployed as hardware software or as service models meaning ctna accommodates increasingly cloud-based and internet-dependent enterprises it will also become a key principle of secure access service edge or sassy which provides a converged network security service at the edge both distributed models have no security perimeter and both assume any traffic flow could be malicious ztna fills the gaps of vpn access though in network security mainstay vpns struggle to accommodate cloud vpn's problems with scaling managing and troubleshooting combined with the disappearing network perimeter contribute to the push for ztna adoption want to learn how to define xero trust network policies click on the link above or in the description below for an outline of ztna policies has your organization implemented ztna does it plan to let us know your thoughts in the comments and be sure to hit that like button too you
