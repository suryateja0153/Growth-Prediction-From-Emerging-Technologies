 hey it's keith townsend principal of the ctl advisor and you're watching a sponsored video or a sponsored interview by our friends at vmware again specifically the sd-wan and sassy organization organization sassy a new term you haven't heard yet here on the cto advisor cto does where we're going to get into it a little bit we have a familiar guest an alum so to speak craig connors of sd-wan and sassy at vmware craig welcome back to the show hey thanks keith it's great to be back you know what and this is an international show if you look in the background my friend craig is all the way in mexico craig i hope the weather is better than it is here in chicago well we had a hurricane the other day but now that the hurricane's passed the weather's back to to sunny mexico weather well hopefully you make it home safely or home in the u.s safely the uh let's start off this conversation this is being sparked by a gartner mq report gartner does these comparisons of the markets at large and one of the questions that i've had as gartner kind of defines and redefines the the market i wanted to make sure we're talking apples to apples can you talk about this edge infrastructure category that they defined what is the edge infrastructure yeah so the category is actually wayne edge infrastructure and it's kind of a broader term than just sd-wan i think one of the challenges we've seen throughout the evolution of our product and our industry even is that the term sd-wan has has gotten a little nebulous itself right we've got 65 vendors claiming to be sd-wan vendors everybody does things a little bit differently but at our core what we're all doing whether we're router vendors whether we're firewall vendors whether we're sd-wan vendors is we're trying to connect companies together at the when and so that's where the term wayne edge infrastructure comes in it's all about how are you connecting my sites how are you connecting me to the cloud how are you connecting me to other things that i need to reach across the land so i think that's pretty self-explanatory i get that so anything that provides connectivity not necessarily in a data center but from one uh site to another side or whatever i consider the wind that connectivity infrastructure is called wind edge infrastructure okay so i i get that that's self-explanatory but what i don't know if i get is this other term that i've seen kicked around which is sassy and that's in your title now how does sassy differ from when edge infrastructure yeah so you know sassy is it's about the convergence of network and security and and i think you know what we've seen recently is the advent of a lot of security mechanisms that require a lot more compute than traditional security used to we used to think of security as the firewall that sits in the branch and does ids ips and does anti-virus and now we've got a lot more modern security techniques where we have sandboxing where we have network threat analytics using machine learning where we have remote browser isolation that are very cpu intensive require a lot of compute infrastructure and cloud computing really plays a key role there and how we deliver that but at the same time we've got to make sure that those security components are close to the users so we've got to take that cloud computing infrastructure and distribute it closer to where users are in what we call points of presence distributed around the network and the last piece is while wayne edge infrastructure is really focused on that traditional branch or office environment that router that we're used to talking about we also have and this is more true in 2020 than it ever was before people connecting from all over the place so people at home people on the go connecting from their laptop or their phone and so you bring in that work from anywhere piece you bring in the sd-wan piece for the office access and you bring in those distributed security services and that gives you that secure access services edge or sassy so as i think of that broad space especially since you meant the term work from home i think of i think of some vmware solutions frankly like the vmware euc portfolio how does that play in the sassy portfolio or solution in general yeah absolutely it's it's definitely touching on the various parts of the vmware portfolio to deliver this solution in june of this year we announced vmware secure access which is actually just what you talked about it's workspace one tunnel app running on your endpoint device connecting directly to our sassy pops so you can get access to your sd-wan network and the other services we deliver from your workspace one enabled device we've also got a cloud web security solution that we've built through a partnership with menlo security where we're taking their security stack and deploying in our pops alongside our other components and then we've got the nsx firewall so nsx distributed firewall and data center with the last line acquisition that we made recently for network threat analytics and sandboxing building a cloud scale firewall as a service based on nsx firewall and putting that in the pops so you've got workspace one you've got sd-wan you've got the cloud web security with menlo partnership you've got nsx firewall all of that coming together to deliver this sassy solution so those are all very separate solutions can i look forward to having kind of a single control plane across all of them one day yeah absolutely i mean that's that's part of the promise of sassy one of the reasons why we want to do this in addition to the networking challenges is to make it simpler to run the network right pat gelsinger has a slide that he likes to throw up where he talks about security and in the thousands of vendors we have in the security market and all of these different logos and i talked to so many administrators like i'm sure you do where it can be a big challenge if i've got one solution for on-prem firewalling and one solution for cloud web security and one solution for remote access and i'm trying to make sure that i'm delivering a consistent security posture across my enterprise with all of these different uh you know modules i have to monitor and so as part of this transformation we're bringing all of this together under our orchestrator and configuring everything from a single pane of glass giving you one place to manage this entire sassy network so i got sassy as the big picture and let's zoom in specifically to this gardener record the mq around the magic quadrant around uh when the the wind edge infrastructure what key areas of interest do you think vmware customers should really focus in when it comes to this report yeah that's a that's a great point i think you know one of the things is we're super fortunate to have been named a leader three years in a row in the gardner-weiner magic quadrant i think that that really represents our continued strength as a vendor so you want to look at how your vendors not just performing right now but how they performed over time being able to continue to deliver that quality solution i think gartner delivers alongside the magic quadrant something they call the critical capabilities report which maps directly to different types of verticals so you can look at small and medium business large enterprise when cloud first win maybe map the use cases a little bit more specifically to what you're trying to build for your specific business requirements and also look at that and how that augments the magic quadrant to help you make an informed decision about the vendors you should be evaluating so let's get away from this uh let's call it analyst speak a little bit and talk some practicals because i i get the big picture vision of sassy this is really great gold vmware's orchestrator will help bring that all together uh sd-wan solution by vmware has been a leader in this space even if you look past the mq it's just been a leader in the space recognized best in class solution velocloud by vmware but what if i'm an existing customer and i see the sassy offering but i'm just not in the euc portfolio for vmware i need this sassy portfolio how do you meet me where i'm at as a customer with a sassy vision but not all the individual components provided by vmware yeah absolutely i mean sassy's you know it's great to talk about consolidating under a single vendor and and of course i hope that everyone comes and consumes everything from vmware as a one-stop shop but in reality that's not going to happen and customers have vendors they're comfortable with customers have vendors out there have contracts with they don't want to buy it all at once they want to be able to consume it piece by piece right and this is something that's been in our dna from the early days of velocloud through vmware's acquisition through vmware sd-wan we call it our network of cloud services we talk about integrations we've done in the branch with palo alto and fortinet and checkpoint in the cloud right with vendors like zscaler like netscope so i don't think that's going away and one of the things we'll continue to deliver on is this idea of this network of clouds connectivity platform where vmware sd-wan is not just a way to get an on-ramp of vmware sassy services but it's an on-ramp to any set of services you want to consume from any vendor and you know we went so far as to at the same time at vmworld this year that we announced our sassy solution we announced a deeper partnership with zscaler where we're doing a strategic co-development initiative to connect our clouds in a high-performance automated way to make it easier for customers to use vmware sd-wan and z-scaler web security together right and that's really a testament to the fact that we're committed to continuing to do this not just as a vmware assassin solution but also to support this agnostic world where in the cloud you get to pick and choose the different vendors that you want to purchase these sub components from so craig i love that vmware is embracing customers where they're at uh we see this even on the other end of it with the vmware cloud solution spread across every major cloud provider that vmware is basically i you know you can take this as you want whether it's a slant or the reality of it that vmware meets the cio where they're at whether you're an existing customer of competing products from the euc space you're in competing clouds and you're using uh frankly public cloud to displace your existing data center solution velo cloud is pretty much where you want to be from a when edge infrastructure is gardner place uh defines the segment where you want to be you want to find out more about vmware's velocloud solution i'm sure you can go to vmware.com to find out more you want to find out more about the cto visor you can find
