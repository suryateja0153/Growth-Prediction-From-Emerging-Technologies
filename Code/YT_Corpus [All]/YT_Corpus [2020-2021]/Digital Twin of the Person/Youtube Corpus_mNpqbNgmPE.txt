 okay it is four o'clock so we will call to order the February meeting of the Bloomington Board of Park commissioners so first could we have the roll call please Kim Kathleen Mills here les Coyne Israel Herrera all right and then we have the consent calendar which is made up of approval of minutes from the last meeting claim submitted non reverting budget items business report oh sorry business it shows that it's on am I on okay business report okay and a little bit of declaration of surplus so we've all had these since last week thanks to Kim so we have a motion to approve the consent calendar okay all right all those in favor please say aye aye motion carried all right and then we next move on to Section B which is our public comment period and we obviously have some items on the agenda that people might be especially interested in commenting on so I just want to clarify if you haven't been here before even if you have so the public comment period is specifically for items that are not on the agenda so as examples we've had people come and say not on the agenda why is why can you smoke in this park right next to my house or you know how can this playground be fixed up in this Park in my neighborhood so things not on today's agenda so if you have any comment of that type not pertaining to an agenda item you can come up to the podium and if you have a comment related to an agenda item we will certainly welcome that just a little bit later on in the meeting so yes please and I think there's a sign-in sheet there so we can get your name as well so is the is the timer running oh yes sorry I failed to mention yeah we're gonna allow people to minutes tonight and I think Kim's gonna run the timer for us since we yeah perfect okay thank you yeah happy to so my name's Thomas Westgard and I live in Bloomington and I asked about the timer because I last time I was here I complimented you on having the system of the timer because there was some issue with people feeling like they got different amounts of time and and this person didn't get enough and that person got more so this really makes it a lot more fair and I appreciate that and also I think there was a louder Bell that you know just helped clarify things so I it the thing about the timer and the Bell is that makes it there's you know the fair rule that everybody follows like the in the two minute thing like everybody gets two minutes that's how it ought to be there are basic rules that we all follow and so with that in mind the the opposite of that is a content-based restriction which can either discriminate based on the viewpoint or the subject matter for example the law regulating the subject matter of speech would be a city ordinance that forbids all picketing in front of a school except for labor picketing because then that would be you know allowing the unions or anti-union people to have speak but you know not letting people who I don't know have opinions about smoking or something so that would be content-based so that it favors one subject over another in deciding who's allowed to speak so an example of a law that regulates the speaker's viewpoint would be the policy of government official who pro-life proponents to speak on government property but band pro-choice proponents because their views in is that oh I'm done okay all right thank you it's Thomas right yeah thank you is it starting okay hi my name is Alex good lad and I would just like to thank the parks board for having Kathleen Mills moderate and well not was going who interrupts his own meetings and threatens to shut it down thanks so much okay alright thank you sweetie miniatures bonds declare me restate Varinia and kamatovic vats it pero en watch Peniel make certain Estill it see bumbly such music equate abyss dink stop we buy you both Nazim Lee yet en st ELISA Skokie Zappa very tacky she would do svidaniya by at Sarah's do ki Alou bothnia business part no in Ahmad provides a China he patch it Nanak deshita jahna Yetta not clueless Slough China is tech poor Buddha I came here to participate in this meeting as a citizen of Bloomington I read you a rather strange poem by Anna Madhava there's a lot going on that is perhaps reminiscent of totalitarian regimes in this society breaking of rules the shattering of free speech it's also really rather lunch box stuff compared to what people have really suffered in the world but we walk down certain paths and live certain lives and it's important to respect order and process so I'm going to continue speaking for five four three two well not one second twenty seconds I guess there's a lot you can see I never really find myself at a loss for words but I think this parks board needs to consider its role in the world and its role in this city and I suppose that's my time all right thank you all right I don't see anyone else at the podium for the public comment period so we'll move into the other business and just by way of explanation I know there may be some people here interested in c16 the community farmers market rules of behavior we do have that later on the agenda just because the parks board or the Parks Department rather can't can't function unless the a lot of these other items are taken care of in a timely way getting paid to local businesses and putting on local events so we do have some of those first to ensure that we can get those done so first up is the review of partnership agreement with buzz Kirk Chumley theater management paula hammock Devitt this month to recommend approval of a second amendment to the 2019 bus Curt Chumley theater management partnership agreement at the January meeting I presented the first amendment they have had a change in leadership and the management team was was currently interviewing for their new director so it's been difficult to finalize the 2020 agreement so we want to keep the conversation going we did meet a few times with them in February we plan to meet with them and their new director who has just been hired and we'd like to welcome him so we will be bringing the full 2020 partnership agreement to you at your March meeting and introduce the new director so this amendment is just to keep in place the 2019 partnership agreement with Buskirk Chumley theater management okay so sort of keep it keep us on a status quo and that's meet Lee director okay all right so so do we have a motion on this one right I move all right all those in favor of the partnership agreement oh I'm sorry any public comment or question about this item sorry did you have the timer again okay Thomas Westgard again on c1 the review and approval of the partnership agreement with the bus Kurt Chumley theater management with Paula McDevitt we all know and cherish the United States Constitution dearly so in honor of the second amendment I will read the second amendment to the contract which is second amendment to the partnership agreement this agreement amendment entered into this blank day of March 2020 by and between the city of Bloomington Indiana its Board of Parks commissioners which used the term parks board later in the contract and its Redevelopment Commission which just shortened to Commission or collectively all of that is the city and BCT Management Inc and Indiana nonprofit corporation and that's called BCT M witnesses whereas parties entered into a partnership agreement for management of the bus Kirk Chumley theater with an effective date of January 1st 2019 the original agreement and whereas the parties entered into a first agreement to the original agreement that extended the term of the original agreement until March 4th 2020 which was you know just a couple days ago and whereas the parties are continuing their negotiations regarding the new partnership agreement for 2020 and whereas it's in the public interest that the term of the original agreement be extended further until April 1st 2020 or until a new agreement is reached now therefore it is agreed between the parties hereto that paragraph 3 of article 2 duration of agreement shall be amended to read as follows this agreement shall be in full force in effect from January 1st 2019 until April 1st 2020 unless replaced by a new sorry thank you hi how are you I am firmly against an interpretation of the Second Amendment that does not provide for the creation of a well-regulated theatre according to the Amendment whereas parties entered into a partnership agreement for management of the bus Kirk Chumley theater with an effective date of January 1st 2019 original agreement and whereas the parties entered into a first amendment to the original agreement that extended the term of the original agreement until March 4th 2020 and whereas the parties are continuing their negotiations regarding the new partnership agreement for 2020 I don't understand where as in the context of regulation there is no provision for the creation of a theater militia or for the fact that our rights should not be infringed of this delicate and pressing matter and I have another full minute so I think what do you guys think I should do well you know I did take a lot of time this last summer in the market it was quite an enlightening experience I spent probably five months looking at white nationalist every single day every single Saturday and that's a problem for me it's been a problem for a very long time and I can't believe that there are so many people sitting right here looking at us with what is this feigned faint interest is that what it is because we don't tolerate the intolerant that's the problem that's what we've lost we don't tolerate intolerance because we therefore lose our own tolerance because those will overwhelm us is that clear thank you I would just like to also comment if if there's to be let's say 10 or 15 or even 20 minutes before the vote of each one of these other items I mean that's that's fine there's public comment we would ask that it would be relevant to the item that we're actually voting on and also if we don't get to all of these items than what's essentially happening is we're we're hijacking the other things on the agenda which may be well okay so perhaps you don't care about Bloomington soccer or tennis or invasive species or artisan contracts well I understand that well we have a place on the agenda to discuss that and we're fully expecting to have plenty of comments at that place but it does I guess I'm frustrated to think that these other things may not actually even happen in the next couple of months if we can't get to their approval this evening so I just put that out there and I would ask people while we're voting on a particular motion if you could make your comments please relevant to that mode to that motion go right ahead hi I have a little I mean not so much a statement but just some relevant theater history that I think we should take into account with this item so for the first 25 years of its existence the Indiana theatre was racially segregated african-american patrons were only permitted to sit in the theaters balcony while white patrons could sit anywhere the situation changed in 1948 the theaters manager a B Clark made a phone call to and I apologize for butchering the same but george taliaferro a popular african-american football player at indiana university clark invited Taliaferro to bring a date to the indiana theater and sit wherever he liked because of tala fear of status as a sports hero nobody challenged his right to sit anywhere in the theater the next week he sat on the main floor again this time with another african-american football player and their dates again no one challenged them and thus the Indiana theatre quietly became racially integrated in the late 1960s college small cinema opened up on Bloomington's east side creating suburban competition for the Indiana and other town movie theaters this was a period of general decline for the city's downtown and the future of Indiana became even less certain when the last of the theaters original owners again apologies Nova von der Schmidt died in 1974 the Indiana was excuse me yet the Indiana theatre was spared of closing when the Illinois based movie che and kara Saudis theater stepped up and brought the theater in 1976 under Kara Saudis theater management the Indiana theatre continued to show movies for another 20 years in January 1995 that theater closed and two months after that the company's East Side Cineplex went from six to eleven screens so I mentioned this because the fate of the downtown building was in question until 1995 when that when Carrie Studies donated the theater to the Bloomington Arts Council and I don't have time unfortunately finish all this but I think this sort of past is the kind of thing that we need more aware to solve thank you these actor roles from the customer and vendor interactions the following conduct is prohibited in the market activity areas picketing demonstrating yelling excessive and unreasonable noise making I guess unreasonable noise making mean singing because that's what we got arrested for last year if I remember right conducting hidden in the flow of pedestrian or access to a vendor and or other conduct disrupting market activities market staff will then ask any persons violating these prohibiting to relocate to a free speech area which I actually still would like to know where that's at I've been told two different things one it's in the information le into by a person on the council they don't know I'm sorry to intro we actually are going to talk about all of that when that is up on the agenda but scrying the doors at my time place okay okay if this is not successful market staff successful by market staff will contact the Bloomington Police Department BPD BPD will reiterate the request to move and if this is not successful the individual may be subject to arrest which like I said I guess singing is disruptive and trespasses I still they're saying that because from my interest in the public property no one in this room owns the market property second of all since I got 24 23 22 21 seconds let's talk about how SAF stands have came up to me personally one person told me that they thought I needed to be euthanized like in Hitler days another person transgender friend of mine was told harassing and bashing nothing was done about that but I don't understand the CFC is still there and they're suing the city but you still allow makes no sense thank you thank you hello my name is Nate I live here just like you do miss Mills I just want to thank you for your comment and let you know that I that I absolutely value Bloomington soccer you know MC tennis and Monroe County martial arts specifically in regards to reviewing and approving the partnership amendment with Buskirk Chumley theater management I have a few remarks but first just a quick comment about the story about george taliaferro it's legendary legendary man legendary story and as i heard it he walked into the theater I think on a Tuesday afternoon when Black Blue Man Tony ins were not allowed to see a film there and he walked in with the screwdriver and he removed the whites only sign from the wall he put in his pocket and he went and sat down and he kept that as a trophy and there's some really good photographs of it floating around I mean what an amazing story about Bloomington so yeah sorry about that look about the theater I'm sorry that was rude so look Paulo McDevitt at the time director on December 11th 2018 the department then entered into a partnership with BCG management incorporated to manage the 2019 buzz Kirk Chumley theater season in the original agreement the duration of the agreement was from January 1st 2019 through all the way until December ok thank you for your time thank you howdy everyone as we all know the bus Kirk Chumley the big theater with the Indiana side has been a fixture in this town since 1922 but as it leads environmentally certified is it a park is it a green space and should a contract be entered there and because of now we all like holding car my bullet chlorines pork tenderloin sandwiches and you know I'm here to tell you that since 1922 we've also liked theater you know one day a guy named Herman B Welles came into this town and decided to give everyone a good kick in the behind a bath and show you how to open foreign language departments and you know funnel great scholars into the CIA build this town into the what are they called what is the mayor called the blueberry and the tomatoes so I I just like to say thank you all for the knock-up job you're doing and any contract that you can manage with any of the fine people in this town it surely appreciated and honestly on a more serious note we all care about local activities I'm not from here I have literally nothing to do with this place but I've come to love it and more than my mockery can sustain me every item you work on and you three work on and everyone who is employed by this city works on is affected by justice and by racial justice in particular so you think about it and you think about the people who've had to sit in the back while you sit in the front and I'll leave you your ten seconds you so all those in favor of the agreement with Buster Chumley theater management please say aye hi motion carried next up we have just Klein with the review of a partnership agreement with IU Health hi good afternoon I'm Jack lime I'm the health and wellness coordinator for the city of Bloomington Parks Department I'm here to you here today to talk about the approval of the partnership agreement with IU Health Bloomington this partnership has been established for about 10 years now and we both work together on the health and wellness of the community we have a strategic action plan that follows eight strategic parts and those include sports medicine marketing employee wellness and health and wellness resources the respective teams will we will continue to meet annually to of reevaluate the partnership agreement make changes as we see necessary and then move forward from year to year there are no major changes from last year okay yeah this has been ongoing for some time sports medicine employee wellness as you say so all right questions are we ready for a motion okay do we have any public comment or questions about IU Health partnership agreement and please again if I could remind you of you if you have comments related to the market item if you could please save those for the market portion of the agenda thank you sure of course I my name is Tom and I'm a resident of Bloomington I have been treated at IU Health and I got a really good care I was very happy with the care that they gave me I was saddened to hear that recently and I guess maybe if there's someone from IU Health here they could confirm this but my friend said that he tried to go to the walk-in clinic and they said that you have to make an appointment at the walk-in clinic which seemed weird because it's a walk-in clinic and supposedly you would you know just walk in and not have to make an appointment but I guess maybe they're swamped I know a lot of people are sick these days but I don't know maybe they should change the name I know he was very sick anyway so one of the one of the key people at IU Health you know with where you're making the contract is Dennis Murphy he's the president and the chief executive officer of IU Health which is the largest healthcare system in Indiana I'm sure you've driven I've driven all over the state and it's kind of amazing how often while you're going down the highway you'll see IU Health so definitely they they have the size to handle the volume here he joined IU Health in 2013 as the chief operating officer so he came in basically that's one level lower and he's guided IU Health as it builds a larger market role in value-based care and he enhanced outpatient care and that's really important because hospitals are keeping people in for shorter amounts of time now so the outpatient care is really crucial to the quality of service also virtual visits which saves people a lot of time you know for things where you don't actually to be in the room with the doctor okay thank you thank you hi again also a resident of Bloomington I wasn't gonna talk about my experience by health but since you brought it up I have never been told to get an appointment although it's been many years since I've tried to go to the walk-in clinic but they did not accept my I you health insurance when I did go there few years ago I thought that was strange I don't know if that's changed since then but nevertheless I think that they have expanded sort of beyond what they're capable of of the service providing good services to people I think that's a consideration however you know the people who are involved in this contract seem to be good people for the most part who are trying to bring some services to this place so one of them is Gary D Henry OTT a lifelong resident of Lafayette Indiana Henry I graduated from Purdue University's Krannert School of Industrial Management he is currently the chairman of Henry OTT Group an insurance risk management and employees benefits firm with clients throughout the Midwest so very reputable henriette has been with the firm for over 40 years and I don't know if the name is taken from him but I'm assuming there's a connection there he has been an active also in addition to his work an active community volunteer recognized by several groups for his leadership currently he serves on the board of the IU Health West Central Region and chairs its Committee on quality and safety Henry OTT is also president of the city of Lafayette Board of Public Works and safety he chairs the Wabash Heartland innovation network and serves on the boards of the Community Foundation of Greater Lafayette the Art Museum of Greater Lafayette foundation and L THC homeless services which he founded Henry OTT also serves on the Purdue athletic affairs committee and is active with the United Way of Greater Lafayette chairing its community commitment to education so I think we can be grateful for these people involvement thank you I also was not going to share my experience with IU health I had a I had to go I had to hit the emergency room and get a quick pain shot and an x-ray and it cost $1,700 I feel like that's fairly exorbitant considering that I wasn't even there for a half an hour so and that's that's just one story I've heard a lot of stories one of my biggest issues with the healthcare system as an IIU health helps pervade this is that insurance companies are designed to tell us no and we've already seen evidence of that but just within the first two people that commented so I think it's and that's very indicative of the healthcare system in general I have spoken a lot of health care providers recently and people that are directly involved with people and care in the health care industry and they have stated all of them almost almost unanimously have stated that they would never turn anyone away for care but that they have to turn people away because of insurance I think health represents that sector fairly well the insurance sector has aware and this this little aside is about and nobles and nobles retired from Eli Lilly and Company after a 22-year career where she last served as a senior vice president for Enterprise Risk Management and chief ethics and compliance officer she has served on the boards of director of iu health since 2011 and as board chair from 2014 to 2015 she also serves as vice chair of the board of directors of citizens Energy Group hmm where she has served as either a trustee or member of the board of directors since 2000 Nobel's has been a member of the board of trustees of the image Indiana chapter of the Nature Conservancy since 2013 presently chairs that board she is active in the work of her church Second Presbyterian Church of Indianapolis Nobles holds bachelor's of Art Bachelor of Arts degree of Arts and Masters of Arts degrees from Harvard University and anthropology with a focus on archeology she received her Jake what is JD a law degree from Georgetown University thank you hi again I'm Nate from Bloomington I was born here a cradle Bloomington Ian you might say I have some remarks but briefly just would like to apologize to wtiu for moving your microphone earlier I didn't see who it was from and I think I was a little nervous this is uncomfortable for me as public speaking is not exactly hmm you know something I'm good at anyway regarding the agenda item Stephen G more MD has served as president and CEO of Carden & Associates since July of 2000 more an Indiana native like myself graduated from the Indiana University School of Medicine additionally he trained at the Mayo Clinic in internal medicine and at John Hopkins University in preventing medicine actually don't know what that is and I'm not sure if I pronounced it correctly where he earned his Master of Public Health degree and spent one year as chief resident card on and associates has a 30-plus year history of developing and managing communities for seniors in the state of Indiana the company currently owns operates or manages 21 communities for seniors throughout the state of Indiana these communities offer skilled nursing and rehabilitation services long-term care memory care assisted living senior housing apartment yes thank you yeah thank you Oh golly I'm historian by trade and memory care probably means something different to me that it means die you health ultimately I I've had the experience when my health insurance wasn't accepted and I'm curious as to the nature of the contract between the Parks Department and IU health if one of the three percenters or American Vanguard or even an American identity movement member were per se to shoot someone in the market would high you health be the one charged with mopping up the blood is that the nature of the contract or is it just simply about providing services to the parks I guess I could have read the packet I think I might wrap up I just want to say one thing mr. Hall here has been photographing people in this line as they lined up and I want to give you the opportunity to take a picture of me so you can send it right to your friends Sarah died mr. Hall any whose hands that it might make it into who are a physical violent threat to the market into this town yes go ahead and take a picture be proud of yourself you sir are a gentleman thank you hi my name is Cassie and I wanted to first of all I wanted to talk about IU Health's mission statement and then afterwards if there's enough time I would like to discuss my own experiences with IU Health and this is read from the IU Health websites about us section and it's entitled harnessing the power of philanthropy to improve Hoosiers health I have a friend who actually pronounces it huger's but that's a different story anyway um Indiana University Health Foundation an entity of Indiana University health harnesses the positive impact of philanthropy to support our goal to make Indiana one of the healthiest states in the nation our approach is to improve the health of individuals community and our state by focusing philanthropy on people progress and partnerships foundations of iU Health refers to the Foundation's rosette representing IU Health which include local Hospital based foundations our integrated partnership with the Rehabilitation Hospital of Indiana foundation and the flagship IU Health Foundation critique and analyzed the mission statement well so I think about their their mission statement to make Indiana one of the healthiest states in the nation and I remember a time when I was a victim of a violent crime and I was transported by ambulance which at the time was actually owned by Indiana health so when I got my you know I was built for the time that I spent in the emergency room for my ambulance ride it actually kind of bankrupted me and my time is up now yes thank you leave you with that all right thank you so again mmm before we vote I would just like to remind people yes it is helpful if you want to look at what is in the the packet pertaining to the agreement the agreement with IU Health is on very specific terms it is not to use an analogy the City Council recently voted on towing ordinances it's not a place for every person who's ever owned a car to get up and explain their background of owning a car it was very specifically about towing so this is very specifically about sports medicine employee wellness health and wellness resources etc so all those in favor of this agreement please say aye aye motion carried thank you and next up we have the review of a contract with monster digital marketing from Julie Raimi I'll take it thank you good afternoon my name is Julie Raimi I'm the community relations manager with the city of Bloomington Parks and Recreation Department and I'm here to recommend approval of a service agreement with monster digital marketing to develop a visually appealing and technologically superior website for the Twin Lakes recreation center the Twin Lakes recreation center is of course our sports fitness and wellness facility located on West Bloomfield Road it is operated much like any other gym or fitness center in town with membership based as well as a host of sports leagues and tournaments especially for youth the presence of like the agreement says a technologically superior website would allow people who are looking for those kinds of services to be able to easily find them in cyberspace when they're searching for a gym in Bloomington and the company monster digital marketing is a locally owned company with a great reputation among the websites that it has developed the total amount of the contract is not to exceed six thousand seven hundred ninety five dollars and that includes the research search engine optimization and the maintenance of the site with code updates security updates and the like for the rest of the calendar year okay any questions about the agreement okay no motion okay okay any public comment or questions specifically about the agreement with monster digital marketing for the Twin Lakes recreation center hi I'm Tom I'm a Bloomington resident just want to make sure that the timer's going so I get the correct amount I I have some experience with digital marketing I at one time I had a website that was about 300 pages and I invested quite a bit of time and energy in learning about search engine optimization which is essential to digital marketing because it's you know it most people use Google or there a few others like Yahoo DuckDuckGo and other popular search engines and that's usually the most common way that people connect with a website there is obviously the traditional marketing aspect of things like business cards or postcards or whatever but most people are going through the search engines so the digital marketing aspect is super important but about monsters specifically they they specialize in creating search engine optimized websites which I really appreciate they they can either build websites or optimize existing ones so that way the cities covered whichever one is needed and I was I was really amused because this this company I mean Monster is a it's a website for finding a job but you know so they had to distinguish themselves and so the business advisor suggested that they not just go with Bloomington SEO because that's super boring who would ever want to just be named Bloomington SEO because also they do business all over the United States so just limiting it to Bloomington wouldn't make any sense and also SEO I don't know if I define that but search engine optimization seo so he was looking around for a way to name it and he saw his fluffy white Bichon Frise MS monster and we have a photograph here of the dog alright thank you hello again I love our parks and I really appreciate the opportunity to talk to you about something I'm also very passionate about which is high quality web design and the what it can do I think a lot of people you know assume you know what is a park need with with a state of the art website right but in fact you know I don't as someone who specializes in rhetoric among other things the importance of not only being able to get information to the public in in a way that will actually be accessible to them but but also in a way that will help them appreciate and understand better the information they're getting and so I think that this contract with Monster is an excellent idea I hope that we will consider the importance of these sorts of things moving forward with with all of our parks and you know monster I would a lot of the things that Tom said and I'd also add that it's not just about creating a great looking website that you know can interest people it's much more complicated it really is about multi-modality and and introducing people to information by helping them make the most of the intersection of word and image and I think monster they have been many for many years demonstrating their prowess in that area excuse me miss about that word so just to quote from their own packets it is important to present a well-designed site not only to current customers but to prospects as well we can provide you with the quality web design that is both easy to access and easy to navigate for your visitors every site we build and host is fast fast loading maintained with up-to-date code secured against hacking and secured against malware and I find that to be my experience as well thank you hi it's Brandon again I was reading the proposed contract with master digital marketing LLC an article 9 stood out to me it says article 9 opinions of probable cost all opinions of probable construction costs to be provided by contractors shall represent the best judgment of contractor based upon the information currently available and upon the contractors background and experience with respect to projects of this nature it is recognized however that neither contractor nor the department has control over the cost of labor materials or equipment over contractors method of determining cost for services or over competitive bidding marketing market or negotiating conditions accordingly department cannot and does not warrant or represent that the proposals or construction bids received will not vary from the cost estimates provided persuade into this agreement this does not seem correct to me I think the contractor does have control over these things does the contractor have control over labor costs I think they do does it go does a contract or have control over overly competitive bidding I think they do does a contractor have control over negotiating conditions I think they do does a contractor have control over their own method of determining costs for services I think they do also a contractor can and should have control over the costs of materials and equipment by seeking out various sources and comparing prices therefore I believe this contract it's not accurate and what it says thank you thank you ladies and gentlemen distinguished people human beings of all types it's my honor to get an opportunity to approach this microphone speak into it at a volume that creates noise that you can hear with your ears that's then transmitted to your brains in a language that you speak therefore we are now communicating it's most excellent so thank you for this opportunity I would like to thank my mother for giving me the opportunity to be here today 31 years ago I would like to thank my kindergarten teacher mrs. Dudley for inspiring me to color in and outside the lines in a way that brings me great satisfaction and I would also like to thank my second grade teacher her name escapes me but she was there she filled me with promise the promise it takes you stand up in front of an audience and say almost nothing and fill two minutes doing it with pleasure so thank you mom thank you Miss Dudley and my second grade teacher you ladies are not forgotten today and so that brings me to my point do we really want to celebrate monsters absurd thank you thank you so much it makes this so much easier my name is Joe Varga and I'm a resident of Bloomington I've lived here for 10 years now and I've come to love Bloomington I love Bloomington the way white people love mayonnaise I love Bloomington the way crows like telephone wires I just I've come to love it so much and I've come to respect it so much our freedom of speech it's restricted to certain areas and so I feel compelled alas I am compelled to rise in opposition to this contract for at a time when our society is filled with monsters monsters of all times monsters like mediocre white men who throw people out of meetings and give some people more time than others to speak monsters like people who pretend to be objective political actors but defend white supremacy and then take pictures of people and probably will publish them dangering arise because the people that they are in concert with are dangerous people monsters indeed when we live among these monsters is that the time to award a contract to a company called something I don't know monster digital marketing I say not monster digital marketing won't somebody alas think of our children once think of the puppies if we can't stop this what can we stop in our bastion of free speech your move to speak by this aren't you my god does much stop thank you MDM is a maneuver that was performed upon me once long ago or was it a monster energy drink which has the sign of the devil in the logo Klaus darkness sadness eternal nights these are the things that this evokes to mine I don't know what need of digital marketing the parks board has in the first place I don't know why you can't hire a whiz like one of the mayor's speech writers or you know someone who can do IT this guy right here has IT experience and he's a jack of all trades uh I could learn C++ is that still the thing or is it Python now Python like I'm not much of a snake guy monsters but I could learn these things and be moved to employ if you'll pay me half half of what you're paying monster digital marketing all do the work by myself after I finished my dissertation on the fate of Soviet writers who are oppressed by stalling now that's some real repression those are some real monsters you know the people who are around in the mid twentieth century but we have these pretenders to monstrosity all around and I just want to say you called Charles and you're gonna get some good internet services and I'll make you an energy drink of my own concoction on the house hello so I minced everything else that folks are talking about one issue that actually hasn't come up that I do actually think is a bit of a moral question that we need to consider when you know hiring a digital marketing firm is the use of metadata I don't know sure if everyone's aware that many corporations including Facebook and Google and lots of others that we haven't heard of they they're constantly monitoring us even people who don't have facebook pages have files that are owned by Facebook that are keeping track of all of our digital behavior and so the question that comes up is a is the public's use of City Internet access you know to City information and Parks information going to be tracked and surveilled in that way and if so will will we have the opportunity as users to opt out of it and also regardless of the answers to those questions then I would wonder are there things that the city can do with that data that would be beneficial to the mission of the Parks Department and stuff like that so that's that's all I wanted to say thank you very much all right we have one more comment here and then we're going to take a vote on this issue okay so I've already used up six seconds so we're talking about digital marketing which we all know we're most doing here that I have no clue about but what I do have a clue about is when someone who is called all the way from Massachusetts who is the president of a I am Patrick Casey a few people in here know him personally with SCF invited him so he came here to buy tomato from Massachusetts that's BS while he was here not only did he follow me around and a friend of mine but I know you're little aggravating takes me a minute to talk but he also privately of run Wharton not in the market but a friend of Sarah dice took our picture blasted it with horrible hateful words all over his Twitter which is not just national worldwide he is a president of a I am but yet you who are by the way if you didn't notice all white on the board here allowed him to come to the market be stand-in for SCF that's what I know about digital marketing bashing you know what I also know is to people in this room who are friends of Sarah dies and her husband don't know his name don't care blasted my picture when I was standing in front of my son's grave all over Twitter horrible that's what I know you know what I also know is my picture my car my home nothing son about it okay thank you all right so all those in favor of the agreement with monster digital marketing for Twin Lakes recreation center please say aye aye motion carried all right so um when we obviously have a strategy here to eat up as much time as possible I've been a protester sorry it sounds like you do so so I'm gonna respond to that for a minute so I've been a protester before in various occasions in my life and so I asked myself when people are protesting in this fashion what's the goal of it and one goal could be to eat up enough time so that we never get to the review of the Farmers Market rules of behavior I suppose that could be a goal eventually we could have to leave the room we could have to schedule another meeting that would happen I guess another possible goal could just be to be annoying I'm a high school teacher I can do annoying all day long so I understand that as a goal but I am also about efficiency and I don't really see the purpose of going through on every single one of these contracts and having a unrelated conversation before we have each one of the votes we are welcome we certainly welcome any comments about the Khmers market rules of behavior related issues that is on the agenda we are not saying that people cannot comment on that just for efficiency sake it seems like it would be better to proceed with the rest of the items on the agenda more quickly and I've been advised by city legal that we can do that with skipping the public public comment period on the you will still have plenty of time to comment you'll still have plenty of time to comment when that item is on the agenda so you will still have plenty of time if your goal is to comment you'll still have plenty of time to do that yes so we are going to move on with the next item I if you have items if you have comments that are actually tangential to the item again I point out the analogy of city city towing I didn't get up with a city council meeting and describe every car I've ever owned at how many oil changes I had and read random things off the owners manual so no I'm not deciding okay so alright alright so we are going to take we are going to take a break we are going to briefly adjourn the meeting and take a ten minute break please for a break and we're going to reconvene and we've decided since clearly people have a lot of things to say about some items later on the agenda it might make more sense to bump those up so right we're going to deal with all the items on the agenda but in in out of courtesy to people here who might want to speak on items later in the agenda we're going to go ahead and move those up so okay sir we've said it's her weave what's going what's going on is that people want to speak to an agenda item and we're accommodating you by moving it up in the so that is what we are going to do now okay we're going I'd ask you please we're trying it's not illegal we have consulted with city leader okay we're going to move on we're going to move on to item C 15 in which Paulo McDevitt will discuss an update to the administrative policy 2050 which is related to somewhat related to the farmers market and other parks Thank You Paula thank you moving to this agenda item staff is recommending the approval of updates to the administrative policy 2050 entitled removal and suspension from use of property owned managed or operated by the city of Bloomington Parks and Recreation Department just a little bit of background on our administrative policy manual this is a compilation of policies by which the Bloomington Parks and Recreation Department and the board operate to maintain its usefulness this policy manual must be updated and revised at regular intervals or as necessary concurrent with board approval the policy manual is also referred to to throughout our capra accreditation process it is the backbone of our operation and is used through our re-accreditation I would like to now go through this policy and I will cite the recommended update policy 2050 section 1 removal the proposed update is in Section 1 C however I would like to review section 1a and 1b section 1a removal in accordance with the authority established in Indiana code 36:10 for and Bloomington Municipal Code 2.20 a person may be asked to leave or be removed from property owned managed or operated by the city of Bloomington Parks and Recreation Department for reasons that include but are not limited

parks and recreation department actions are behaviors which unreasonably cause or creates a risk of causing damage to property owned managed or operated by the city of Bloomington Parks and Recreation Department or actions are behaviors with constitute a public notion this policy is used throughout our department at our facilities property zoned and Parks section V of this policy the following individuals have the authority to ask a person to leave or ask a person to be removed from a property owned managed or operated by the city of Bloomington Parks and Recreation Department employees of the city of Bloomington Parks and Recreation Department or law enforcement officials lease but they will be public they'll be public comment period in a moment ok because we're asking you to please wait till the public comment period all right please slip please let me speak debit finish please would you you will have time to comment on me I changed the rules to accommodate people might like to

public comment period rests one of those comments okay the rule that we're following is that someone raised an issue and she is from city legal department who would like to answer she is from the city legal department she would like to answer the question that was raised if you would be quiet for a minute you could hear her name okay yes apologies Hitchens filter you will have a chance you've had

going to ask you to leave the meeting there is a place to make a comment no one of silencing you we're just asking you to wait into the comment period that's all okay so Paula could you please on the dish with me yes please thank you section one C of the policy any person who is asked to leave or is removed from property owned managed are operated by the city of Bloomington Parks and Recreation Department shall be advised of the reason he or she is being asked to leave or is removed the update to this policy would read any person who is asked to leave by law enforcement officer as defined by Indiana code and refuses to do so may be subject to arrest section 2 of policy 20/50 suspension policy 2050 section 2 suspension in accordance with the authority established in Indiana code 36 10-4 and Bloomington Municipal Code 2.20 a person may be suspended from use or entrance on part property owned managed or operated by the city of Bloomington Parks and Recreation Department for reasons that include outlined in the administrative policies 2050 and as I just previously read through that list in section 1a the policy update that is recommended in Section 2 suspension is in Section B and C and it is the addition of the word heard in the dirt the determination that a person is to be suspended from use or entrance on property owned managed or operated by the city of Bloomington Parks and Recreation Department is limited to the director of Parks and Recreation and or his/her appointed designee Section C once the decision to suspend has been determined a person will be notified of the suspension in writing via certified mail or personal service the notification will be signed and dated in the direct by the director of the Parks and Recreation Department and/or his her appointed doesn't need any person who receives a notification of suspension shall have the right to appeal said suspension following the appeal process outlined in administrative policies 2050 and be entitled to a suspension hearing before the board of Park commissioners a maximum length of suspension no suspension shall be issued that is shorter than seven calendar days or less longer than one calendar year upon entry upon or into any property owned managed or operated by the city of Bloomington Parks and Recreation Department by a person who is suspended in accordance with this policy shall be subject the shall subject the person to arrest for criminal trespass in accordance with Indiana code 35 five forty three to two if the request updates are approved the date will be changed at the top of the policy and will be entered into the policy in accordance with updating policy document procedures for accreditation and again as I stated at the beginning of my report this is a policy that has been in place for decades and used throughout the department it's been used at facilities from time to time we have activities that we run that do sometimes get a little out of hand and we've referred to this policy we've used this policy as well in some of our parks over the past two years and I would be happy to answer any questions you have about this policy update all right thank you and just to sort of feedback on to what Paula just said I've only been on the parks board for three years but in that time unfortunately there have been a few instances where someone has been suspended from a park for some period of time the one most recent that I remember someone who threatened a parks employee to the point where she had to call 9-1-1 I believe and he was suspended from the park for some period of time I think 30 days or so this is a continuation of that same rule that we have had so do have any other comments or questions about this all right all right so do we have a we will get to some public comment in a second do we have a motion to approve an update to administrative policy twenty-fifty okay all right any public comment or question about this yes Bloomington I want to reiterate something that was said earlier and that is that's all of the work that you do as city employees is impacted by racial justice and so I want to make a comment about this particular policy as it relates to race racial justice the mayor acknowledged in his State of the City talk that Bloomington has a legacy of racial injustice and this is not debatable we all know this is true this is in our history the mayor also expressed some support for democratic protest generally although he then restricted it kind of climate action protests and so I want to make mention that Democratic protest is important beyond climate action the important thing I want you as city officials to think on when we're approving policies that are restrictive in nature is that Bloomington is by default a white safe city and not by default a city safe for people of color we are over 80 percent white with a tremendous and profound legacy of racial injustice every policy that you write and that you adopt that is about legal restriction of individuals is colored by our legacy of racial injustice and I would like I need my 30 seconds I would like to see in the policy it stated directly that we recognize our history of racial injustice and that this is a risk in our restrictions and that this is called out in the policy that this is something that we're paying attention to and we have a strategy to avoid I think this applies to this particular administrative policy just because it's always been around and it's always worked for us the largely white people in this room does not mean that it's effective or just thank you thank you I think whatever happens here with your vote today although I think we know how you're going to vote the lid or the facade of your investment in the first amendment has been utterly decimated by your choices here so keep that in mind as a tactic banning protests to stop protests is utterly futile the right to free assembly is given by the First Amendment the government does not have a right to use time place and manner restrictions to stop a legitimate boycott you are making the situation worse with your proposed rules which will be received by the majority of the public as the threat to free speech that it is the act map vendor representative by the way to give some context from where these choices are coming from the F Mac vendor representative is an avowed SEF supporter the public has a right to know this because this person is supposed to be representing all vendors interests and instead they are representing the interests of a minority who supports and enables white supremacy all across the country white supremacists are planning to overthrow the government and kill activists le o--'s government officials and of course groups of marginalized groups that they see as their enemy this is not an exaggeration this this is not a situation that can be taken lightly and I don't understand why you won't approach this issue in that context given the overwhelming evidence of that threat and the where the FBI stands on it and where other state governments including New Jersey which has recently declared whites our domestic terrorism to be a higher threat than Isis I don't know why so many smart people are rushing to fill historically predetermined roles of foolish abettors to white supremacy why it is not obvious to you that you will be scorned by people living a hundred years from now alright thank you very much for your contest in your journey to absolute mediocrity and historical Anglian okay good evening to the members of the Parks and Rec board and to all those who are here contributing their time to speak regarding this important community issue my name is Rob Stewart Ingersoll I grew up in Bloomington I went to IU for undergrad and and then moved with my wife who I met working for Parks and Rec a way for a number of years I studied political science and became a professor of international relations and I worked at a number of institutions both traditional as well as military the last institution military I worked at was the National Defense College at the UAE and one of the things that we were primarily worried about concerned about thinking strategically about unless I really wish you would listen your body language speaks volumes and I've known you and I've known your children from when I was a kid and this is shocking your behavior so one of the things that we spent a lot of time one of the things that we spent a lot of time at the National Defense College talking about was violent extremism and how to counter that and we talked a lot about the process of recruiting vulnerable people from society a lot about the marketing strategies of Isis and other groups who portray themselves as good as reasonable as part of society is protecting tradition now that the people that I worked with with the US Defense Department or the people that I worked with in the unit the Emiratis strategic community disputed that the recruitment process the radicalization process the integration into all segments of community like our farmers market our gem of a farmers market was part and parcel of what eventually became the violent attacks that they perpetrated all right thank you sir about that they you I've heard a lot about laws and rules and civility and this process that you saw tonight was designed to make you make a choice would you follow rules do you respect rules would you be civil would you follow the law and you've made the wrong choice I mean ironically you've given us another thing to sue you for by not following your own rules you have made a content-based choice to reorganise the agenda in violation of the Open Meetings Act and why because you don't respect rules you want us to respect rules but when it comes down to the responsibility that you as government officials have the power you hold what do you do rules go out the window you don't care you expect us to care you think we should follow rules and let's be civil but the moment it comes to you where you have to come up with some minor accommodation what do you do hypocrites week hypocrites who don't have the strength of your own convictions to follow rules that's why people don't respect government because you don't respect government enough to follow the rules to give us the respect the free speech opportunities that we are entitled to by law we have Marsha Feldman a management level employee of the city admitting on tape that the rules were changed to affect us that is the most direct violation of the United States Constitution you can possibly find and now you've lined up armed cops to arrest me again with no cause and you know it thank you okay so I just want to make some stuff clear that I don't think Paula quite made clear in our explanation of c15 which is that there there aren't really very many changes to see 15 you still have suspension powers but like there's there's two changes of note the first is that there's there's a change in gendering to his to his / her you might want to put non-binary pronouns there too you know they then there's and also the other thing is that the real sentence that's changed is any person who is asked to leave by a law enforcement officer as defined by Indiana code infuses may be subject to arrest that's the new thing it should have been they're like you know you're like a half a year ago when they started arresting people at the BC FM and and out and I mean my question is if if we can't trust city officials to abide by their own rules because they didn't before why why should we trust them now why should we reward them with more power especially because with good good thing you gave me an extra minute because I can get to some of the statistics that of BPD you the use of force rates from 2018 77.7% on african-americans 90.5% use of force stats on all black women out of all woman arrested you can find this on the bloomington website 2019 that you know that dipped down for some reason to twenty four point five percent and then 18 percent on black woman you can go to the BP and and keep in mind this is a you know the population is 4.2 percent according to the 2018 census numbers of black people so it's it's vastly over-represented why should we trust uh BPD thank you hello I just wanted to talk for a minute about about these changes and whether or not they require codification by the City Council to be actually effective or meaningful or if this is just really some kind of theater to intimidate us into not protesting at the market not you know continuing to take a stand against white supremacy because I look at this board and I I see less and he's I don't know if he's been playing Minecraft or Pokemon or what he's been doing okay but he hasn't really been listening at as was you know apparent when he was called out earlier and I I see you and you're so concerned with just maintaining tight control over the order even if it means that people lose their voices and I wasn't aware when I came into this room tonight that this was a restricted speech area I thought that we would be allowed to talk at the end of each agenda item that we would follow the agenda that was laid out before us I actually thought that there were rules in place that kind of prevented you from going completely off agenda and just talking about the items that you wanted to talk about when that you wanted to talk about them regardless of whether anybody else could participate in that conversation now to go back to my original point about codification by City Council it's my understanding that in order to create rules in which people can be arrested for free speech there has to be some sort of codification in this city city rules or legal yes so I I just wanted to thank you for bringing that up and perhaps we could get city legal to respond to that whether their needs whether we are solely responsible for voting on these rules or whether the City Council also has to come along and approve them or disprove them or the parks board is a statutory board and there is statute governing your powers and you have the power to set policy related to any property under the control of the parks department okay all right thank you good question good question all right yes next good afternoon I would like to thank the board and especially Paula she is one of the few people that over the past couple of years that listened to me and at the same time I appreciate you listening to us when we come to you with what we feel are reasonable alternatives I went to people's Park for my birthday when I was 60 years old and I was called everything but you can't say in public and that made me mad so I went to Paula and I asked her what does grier uncle David do and she says just keep I've be nice and state your case so with that I said what we need to do is to be able to allow people who might necessarily agree with you have that opportunity at the same time I had two uncles that served in World War two and fought the Nazis okay I had two cousins that served in Vietnam okay my son is an servicemen in the Air Force all we ask as a code conduct be nice be respect be accountable and for now did you serve thank you thank you my name is Tran pur Bock I'm a candidate for Senate District 40 I'm a resident of Bloomington I'm really frustrated about this market situation I have been for a long time what I see here is a calamity of errors by this city government less my mom graduated with your brother from the old Bloomington high school I thought people here respected the rights of minorities but that's not what I've seen the last seven months Kirika do wasn't violent she was holding a damn sign why are you all escalating this it's time for de-escalation don't add you know I lived in the south for 17 years after I graduated from Purdue the deep south Houston Texas 17 years I went lived under the remnants of Jim Crow and black laws why is it coming to Bloomington what are you doing with these rules and regulations we know who they're for I'm scared of you all and it shouldn't be like that i-i think professor Ingersoll and everyone has spoken today brought up some excellent points about creep and the creep toward violent ideologies I am a specialist in Soviet history I am a convinced Roosevelt II and Democrat if you will I want this country to succeed and thrive and it thrives on nothing but freedom of speech that being said when there is such a grave threat to people's lives to their voices to their speech that that speech itself stifles life and cuts tongues out something must be done and the thing that could have been done the steps that could have been taken bravely like this by this city but weren't taken because you are afraid of lawsuits and we're sued anyway and by the way as much as I agree as much as I agree with the mayor that die suit is meritless you better get outside counsel because city legal has messed this up and now you are facing other suits and I am NOT a litigious person but I wanted to say something about what the professor said I recently was reading an article by a friend about the spread of Mujahideen from Afghanistan to Isis over a 30-year span after the Soviet invasion and the seeds of radicalism born in one place born out in magazine articles and newspapers by people who were not radical terrorists at the time but had certain ideas about how their integrity should be preserved birthed a genocide already m-- you have to use your conscience thank you I'd like to take the first 10 seconds of my time and have a 10-second moment of silence for each of the victims of the identitarian attacker in Germany last week thank you as you've already heard and I hope that you guys are realizing you're definitely just crashing the bus on this one I can't believe that with all that's going on and all the talk of free speech that you're actually going to change one sentence in a legal document so that it can be brought up so that you can remind us that we are under threat of being banned from is it just the city market or is it all parks properties we can be banned from all parks properties for holding a sign in the farmers market is that what I'm hearing here no it would be the disruption occurred in 3rd Street Park it could potentially be a suspension from 3rd Street but not all parks no not all ok well that's that's nice at least so I also and just still completely stunned by the irony that the last time I was in this room Sharla's it low whose name is on the justice building that killed four people last year and tortured my friend got 5 minutes to speak while everyone else was given two and now we come and we used me as a time that has been legally allotted to us as has is completely in line with the rules and you change the rules so that people are less able to speak the the idea that city government believes in the First Amendment is an absolutely ridiculous concept that I know thank you all right do we have a motion on administrative policy policy 2050 kind of lost track yes move okay all right all those in favor please say aye aye motion carried and the next step is a related item again we have adjusted some of the items because it seemed like three-quarters of the room was interested in those items and in the to allow for more people to be able to participate in them we have moved to the bottom of the agenda so c16 is the review of the Bloomington community farmers market rules of behavior from Marsha Feldman Marsha bellman the farmers market coordinator I'm here to recommend the approval of the rules of behavior as outlined in the January ninth 2020 meeting of the board of park commissioners the mission of the Bloomington community farmers market is to strengthen our local agriculture and food community by serving as a venue to nurture the direct positive relationships between farmers food and beverage artisans and customers to promote a safe and welcoming environment for all while enhancing and reflecting the city of Bloomington's diversity and encouraging multicultural awareness to promote and improve food justice by implementing programs to increase access to market product by low-income populations and to improve local food security and community sustainability by fostering a resilient food supply as the mission statement indicates that the market operates on a variety of levels it is primarily a market a place where local growers farmers food artisans artists can connect with customers and sell their this simple yet profound activity improves local food security strengthens the local economy and enhances community sustainability which is critical as we face a changing environment another fundamental level at which the market operates is as a community gathering place for decades people have come together on Saturday mornings to meet friends and neighbors listen to music participate in events celebrating food culture and community with a focus on the aspect of the mission of enhancing and reflecting the city of Bloomington's diversity and improving multicultural awareness the Farmers Market Advisory Council has established the broadening inclusion subcommittee with the goal of evaluating existing market practices and programs and taking a forward-looking approach by providing suggestions to make the market even more inclusive the market is also a place where people come together to engage with issues politics and movements as is stated in the market information tabeling policy the city of Bloomington parks and recreation department is committed to providing an environment where issues can be openly discussed and explored to that end there are two designated free-speech areas within the market boundaries info alley and plaza 1a as well as public areas beyond the boundaries of the market the rules a behavior are designed to allow the market to fulfill its primary purpose of being a place where farmers artisans and customers can come together while also creating a vibrant community space and allowing for robust community engagement and not just because it's protected by the Constitution because it is a strong civic value the rules of behavior for the 2020 market season have been reviewed and approved by the legal department and Parks and Recreation staff and reviewed by the Farmers Market Advisory Council there are several changes made them to them relatively to the ones in place last year including refining the boundaries of the market to reflect the functional boundaries and further defining types of activities in the market and where they may take place some existing rules that were regularly enforced but not included previously on the written document were added including information on pets and smoking in the market one update made to the rules behavior since those that were included in that January 9th 2020 park board packet is the addition of a reference to the applicability of the Department administrative policy 2050 regarding removal and suspension from property owned managed are operated by the city of Bloomington Parks and Recreation Department I will try and answer any questions you have otherwise other staff can support me on that okay do you have any questions okay yeah I guess I I would just like to comment that I think I total up there's there are seven areas of protest at least in my reading of this seven spaces around the market where a person could go and protest if they wanted to and also just pointing out you mentioned information alley goes back to I believe at least the early 1990s that that space has been there for people who want to protest I also recognize again that the point of protest is is often to cause a disruption the point of protest is to be right there inches away from what it that you're trying to affect I totally get that but I think if we have a free-for-all of protests that we probably don't have a market anymore and we have voted the continuum market and that's that's what we're charged with doing if we're having a market we're having a market I'm I'm not sure the public wants to run a gauntlet through various sides of protestors to buy cucumbers and bread but I understand but I understand that the point I understand that I understand the frustrations and I understand the point of protest is to so with that we'll move to any other public comment I understand that any other problems public comment about this issue yes hello I'm Judy Klein and I urged the park board to adopt these proposed rules of behavior for the farmers market our first priority as a city is to decry white supremacy and work to dismantle it it is not surprising that the ugly legacy of white supremacy is still with us and adherents can be found at the farmers market both among vendors and customers we are reminded daily of how messy democracy is messy enough that both schooner Creek farm and professor kadu can claim their First Amendment rights have been denied in their respective lawsuits I believe the proposed rules of behavior strike a compromise that respects the First Amendment rights of all while allowing commerce to proceed in the setting where customers can choose the vendors they wish to buy from and farmers and prepared food artisans can make a living thank you thank you Anna Lynch longtime Bloomington resident I understand that the city wants to complete a lot of business this evening and I want to reiterate again every bit of business that you complete is impacted by racial justice and I haven't so I have the question for you sorry I have so many questions I opened the wrong one I understand that the rules as laid out in this draft our desing are designed to limit the chances that protests will disrupt the market that's clear you've said that the city wants to make the market a safe place for community building a place where Bloomington ian's and visitors alike can share conversation get to know each other and make new connections of course this kind of environment is also perfect for recruiting white supremacists and expanding that network in full view of a community that is loath to acknowledge or name the sin of racism so to reiterate the city is working to protect an environment of relationship and network building by restricting options for protest which not to state the obvious but that's not going to restrict protests my question to the board is what elements in this draft are designed to restrict or limit white supremacists from relationship building and network ie recruiting in the market in 2020 thank you thank you I I don't think there's that's there's nothing that that we have the power to do in our as a board to restrict people from recruiting I don't know no that is not in our power to do to restrict people from having conversations about that of the market or any other cup or any other conversation about the market that so I'd like to move on to the next commenter please Thomas if you'd like to move on please you know this is how you make it all worse right what you're doing right now the reason for having free speech is so that things don't get worse you give people an outlet you give people an opportunity to speak and have difficult conversations that's why you have free speech if you bottle that up it goes somewhere else I don't know where yet you know we'll be there in one form or another doing our thing we'll be nonviolent now there was somebody who attacked me physically in the market last year to try to provoke me into a fight I didn't take him up on it I called the police they told me that you can you can hit someone in the city of Bloomington and if you don't end up in the hospital or a cop doesn't see it that they won't file charges I knew the man Tim Morrow at white supremacists supporter like mr. Hall here I was able to identify him he struck two other people in the market that day but the police said if they didn't see it they won't do anything about it you act like there are rules but the moment you have to do something to respect those rules you don't do it you created a set of rules that showed up I was frantically running through the market trying to find out the written rules asking everyone I could for the for the rules no one would give me the rules while carica do was carrying your sign hours later you published some bullshit document back dated a month and then we have her on tape saying that the rules were changed to oppress us then you give Charlotte Zeit low two and a half times the amount of time to speak against us you think rules deserve respect you deserve respect you wish thank you thank you sir so I'm quite disturbed by the whole affair the thing is this set of rules intentionally to respond to our speech is content-based restrictions masquerading and as time and place restrictions cannot be cannot stand and they will be challenged there's a fear of course of danger that is rightful among among the public among the vendors among the protesters among everyone who comes around that market I want to make it clear that that threat comes from white supremacists we are not going to be victim blamed we are not going to be scapegoated now Marsha Feldman who spoke in defense of these rules and gave a flowery speech about diversity and inclusivity wears purple today she often wore purple to the market was that a sign of solidarity I'm tempted to ask her but I should focus on anyone I wondered was this a sign of solidarity a milquetoast lukewarm solidarity well I don't like racism I don't like racism and racist and I'm willing to wear a jacket or a color but I'm not willing to respect your free speech I'm not willing to understand the true threat of white supremacy to this country to that flag to this town to our bodies to the bodies of people who are much more vulnerable than we are so I would say don't wear purple if you're not going to stand up for it and don't be a hack thank you yep so I want to talk to you about equivocation and I will make a point in relation to actually I I wanted that map up there but that's all right equivocation is is a word and it means when you use language to disguise your intent it's actually not just a word it's a kind of lying and it's a sort of lying that people do when they are aware that they're lying and they're aware of what they're covering up sir for instance when you create a zone to take up more space in the market where you know protesters were last summer and you call it a free speech zone when it's designed to silence them that's equivocation when you wear purple in defiance of protest because you want to normalize it and pretend like it doesn't mean what it means that's equivocation um when you when you call anything free speech that's meant to silence that it's equivocation and when you say that you believe in diversity but your policies support white supremacy that's equivocation and the reason I know a lot about equivocation is because I study Shakespeare and equivocation is the great crime at the heart of Macbeth which is his play about human evil and for Shakespeare I think it's fair to say that equivocation is the worst kind of evil maybe even worse than original sin but I don't want to go that far nevertheless the reason it's so evil is because it's the sort of evil that regular people do it's the sort of evil that leads a guy like Macbeth who's basically a good guy to do something horrible because he lets his relationship to language dictate his relationship to morality and I think that we can do a little but I don't know actually that we can do better because it's been going on for thousands of years this way I don't expect you people to rise up and overcome it but you should at least be aware of it that what you're doing is equivocation and it is wrong and we will be here to stand up for truth thank you hello are we considering item c16 yes okay just make sure because based on listening to what Martha say I had no idea you know I have the in front of my laptop the like the new draft of the rules of behavior and you know I'll just I'll just tell people what it actually does it it it clarifies what like what protesters can't do basically and well one thing that it clarifies which is interesting is it it talks about some like what vendors can do because like I mean we have this whole issue in the first place because of vendors free speech and I find it interesting that vendors can't carry signs except as laid out in the it says the contract but really it should say the handbook but I mean you guys are going to prove it anyway so why why should I note the error but what what what in the handbook it says and this is a new sentence that was that was approved of back in the January 9th meeting was vendors may only display signs information and/or items at their stands that consists of the products they are selling or that directly relate to their business so so that that's a content-based restriction right there and I know I I know mayor Hamilton is gonna you know say ah but it's it's not a political speech it's a political speech but or whatever he has to say about political speech but like you might want to look up read verses town of Gilbert which you know they tried to say was a content-neutral restriction for something that was tried to restrict protesters and and and and that didn't go so well so I just check it out thank you the lawyer so one thing that I want to touch on is goal posts and how it seems like the goal posts are continually being shifted shifted for us as protesters certainly but also they've been shifted for schooner Creek farm as well I know that nobody's wanting to say the name schooner Creek farm or Sarah die but that the goalposts for schooner Creek farm have been shifted at first when we started this protest gosh what was at nine long months ago almost ten months ago we were told that recruiting for white supremacist terror groups in the market was forbidden well fast forward a few months and we find out that Sarah actually has been effectively recruiting for her white supremacist terror group American identity movement in the market so much so that Patrick Casey who is the president of the American identity movement which is a white nationalist terror group came to Bloomington several weekends and he filmed recruitment videos here he there are pictures of him that have been used on the terrorist website American identity movement featuring Sarah featuring Doug featuring their children and that's been a very effective recruiting tool it seems like I know that they have recruited at least one person in this room and I know that there are people in Bedford that they've recruited and those people actually came to our market from different cities armed with guns and knives and they in some cases assaulted protesters but they always threatened them and I want to talk about that goal post and why that ball post was moved back thank you start my minutes yet please go back forward minute four seconds go back I was not at the mic she's getting it yeah why would you do that ridiculous okay now that I'm talking so Marsha had said and we've all read and heard over and over and over repetitively kind of like the 51st states Jesus safe and welcoming city safe in civil city you know what that's a joke and many agree with me the market is not know this is or not the market is not as long as white supremacy and their support our threatening citizens one citizen is myself another is a very close friend of mine who is in the LGBT community another sitting right beside me who was assaulted another is my immediate next-door neighbor do you know why she doesn't come to these meetings wonder why because she's scared that she will see a supporter of Sarah die and schooner Creek Farm basically same thing son am i selling because why she was grabbed by who not just a supporter I'll say Z Tim Mauro mo rrow also Robert Brummett Robert Brahma write it down he is a white supremacist supporter very good friend also of Sarah died he was upstairs in room 225 harassed me with video making fun of the way I speak in a room full of people nobody said anything do you know why why because no one on your board me I like a few people personally on your board I do not you three because I don't know yet but you know what because you don't give a shit thank you yes 50 seconds when are we gonna talk about the switchyard which chart which which element of Swiss chard which element of Swiss chard Park well there's about 50 well you know the one of the alcohol permit for community events well that's the only other switch charge alcohol is that what we're talking that's that that is another item on the agenda tonight is an alcohol permit for four events in switchyard Park okay are we on that right no right no right now bring that up eventually right we if we have time before we have to vacate the room and we can get to the rest of the items I met with Dave Williams this week or last week since it's a Tuesday Friday and he mentioned that it's in the process of switch art Park brand new building wonderful Bloomington building that's not accessible for the elderly wheelchair users children anyone on walkers I asked when that's gonna happen he says in the process but here's my thing what I told him was if a good architect or project manager had common sense he would have worked that in in the beginning with the walls being up not the friggin last thing you know what's the last thing cuz you don't give a shit about marginalized people thank you okay thank you thank you for bringing that up as well um look Kathleen earlier you were characterizing the point of protesting it is a strategy the point is Justice Kathleen we're asking for justice I I do not believe that you are personally racists I don't believe you are racists defined here as an individual person who harbors feelings of racial hatred in their hearts okay I don't believe that describes you that definition of racism is very problematic so just for the purposes of my remarks here the the policy that you're about to enact is a racist policy the black leaders and other non-white leaders of Bloomington have already called for a public boycott of the city market where are they today they're not here they have already written you off they have no sense of trust in you this is heartbreaking okay I'm heartbroken by that I'm ashamed are you not ashamed of that where are the black leaders of Bloomington and why are they not welcome here why do they feel unwelcome here it's it's the same reason that they don't feel welcome at the market in in dr. qudoos tort claim she's claiming false arrest because the rules were made by an ad hoc committee in an informal session this this is changing that what you're doing now will guarantee that it will guarantee police violence okay what you're doing now is very harmful and it would end the outcome of what you're doing is a racist outcome you are creating I all but guarantee that you are creating an all-white market you should not be doing that thank you BPD has a legal monopoly on violence okay and and whereas before the the legal claim is is that the false arrest was based on informal rules you're being asks to vote on this today because your body is you know statutorily created this this will this will prevent anyone in the future for asking for the the justice that doctor could do is asking for if people engage in free speech constitutionally protected free speech activity in the market political speech where they choose not these bullshit free speech zones you're threatening them with police violence the police will come arrest them if they if they still want to exercise their free speech the police will use violence the only way violence will not happen in that situation is if the person who is exercising their free speech you know self sensors themself and chooses to stop this is why I say that it's a threat of police violence thank you congratulations Kathleen you are now the head of the new caste system CA Ste I want to be clear for everyone here I think there's a lot of misconceptions about what this board is I'm gonna read right from their website about us the board of Park commissioners is a policymaking Authority for the city of Bloomington Parks and Recreation Department the board is comprised of four members appointed by the mayor the board meets and so on okay so you're an executive board you're not a legislative board that's the point what you're making is policy for city employees and city contractors like these vendors you have no authority over the rest of the people in the market that's for City Council to take up if you want to pass Jim Crow rules of behavior you need to put it before the City Council there were no laws on the book I talked I got the city of the city attorney Mike Walker on audio I'm happy to release it to anybody that wants it where he admits these rules weren't even written down I mean how was Kara supposed to know I mean this is so ridiculous and here you are you're caught up in these lawsuits and you can't say I'm sorry why can't you say I'm sorry the Board of Park commissioners have zero power to make much less codified law their policy and policy changes apply only to the conduct of city employees city contractors not to the public at large what is happening today at the Bloomington board a Park commissioners meeting is merely another attempt by this in this failed calamity of errors to intimidate minorities and their supporters with threats of false malicious arrests / bullcrap internal policy changes not lyce any law or municipal code thank you may I go ahead so what I want to point out that you have clearly stated I want to point out that you have clearly stated that you do not have the right to restrict free speech you have consistently made an argument that this is a First Amendment issue and you are not permitted to restrict free speech this policy actually restricts free speech so that's our first disconnect right in logic so when I brought up the issue of recruiting in the market which we know is going on then you said again well we can't restrict their free speech in the market which actually is not true because legally you can restrict hate group recruiting in a city market that's your choice that's the city government's choice to do that so my question to you is since we're going back and forth on we can restrict free speech we can't restrict free speech and it's getting pretty fuzzy why don't we just not restrict free speech let the hate speech be free let the protest speech be free then we're being consistent if you want to make a First Amendment argument let's we can all get behind the First Amendment argument free speech let the white supremacists say their piece let the protesters in to say our piece and then let's see this town is against white supremacy but as long as you're suppressing the protest speech we aren't going to know who's really against white supremacy and that is incredibly dangerous so free speech let's do it thank you so recruiting you mention of including so a is there evidence of how many times these happen in the market I think we have to be careful careful about trying to codify it it's so thinking about how we would approach research quantitative research or qualitative research and I don't think the quantitative piece of this is the critical piece because if we've seen it once or twice I think we can pretty much be sure that we haven't seen it all so we have seen it and no have recounted it no I don't think it's possible to count it recruiting tactics are very nuanced and I mean let and let's just think about what we do as Bluemont onehans in the market and I think of politicians who are walking through the market every Saturday recruiting voters I think it would be hard to follow a politic you'd really pretty much have to follow that person around in a weird stalkery way to start counting how many voters they picked up in that in the course of walking the market and shaking hands so no we don't know how many times but we know it's happening and we know it's being successful because of the visibility that the National white supremacists are giving her so if she weren't successful that wouldn't be happening yeah thanks for your follow up question to relieve there are multiple reports going back at least a couple three years even before these protests started which goes back to you know they've my only other comment here which is that even if you all were to apologize if you're going to go ahead and pass these rules there's no way that we could accept or believe such an apology because you clearly do not respect our freedom of speech you have so much agency like discretion to choose which rules you enforce which is really clear when Sharla's its little wants more time or when you want to rearrange the order of the items on tonight's agenda changing the rules is no problem but then you have a vendor contract that says that recruitment recruitment cannot take place for crazy organizations like this that the vendor assistants who work in the booths have to have their real names given and that no transphobic homophobic or racist speech will be allowed and and the and then I understand the the contract also says that vendors are not allowed to sue the city so Sarah dies farm has broken all of those rules and you have not enforced the contract against her and yet you're bending over backwards to make new rules to make it illegal for us to call for a legal and moral boycott it's just unbelievable to me I don't understand how any of you sleep at night hello my name is robert hall I may be the only speaker in favor of your rules tonight I'd never heard of Spooner Creek Farm Sara died or identitarian before July I am a conservative Republican I started reading everything I could find about the controversy at the Bloomington farmers market I even interviewed Sarah dye and asked her directly if she was a white supremacist she said absolutely not I've asked her three times same answer then I observed what was going on at the farmers market racist graffiti and Tifa protesters intimidation harassment false accusations misrepresentations loss of attendance invasion of privacy daxing I was doxed vandalism and intolerance the only hate I saw displayed was by opponents of Sarah die so I invited Sarah dye to speak at a meeting of the grassroots conservatives at the evidence ville library unfortunately protesters disrupted our meeting more hate was displayed by them my conclusion is our freedom is more threatened by these radical protesters than by Sarah die I call on the park board to approve farmers market rules of behavior that restricts protesters and boycotting to information Ali thank you okay sorry I'm speaking because I did not want Robert Hall to have the last wood so so everyone in this town tells me that this town welcomes protesters and protests but what I've actually observed is that when it comes to anti-racist work it comes with a caveat as long as you don't make other white people uncomfortable and as long as you don't go against beloved institutions and so I've been told to worry about the KKK instead or like more about forums of hatred but the biggest concern to me right now is the civil and polite face of white supremacy that identitarian ism presents of course right now adays and identitarian as they call themselves they're not going to tell you that they were white supremacist they're gonna say oh I just don't believe in you know immigration from countries that have people of color just the other day one of Sarah's friend Lana who runs red eyes TV which is a white supremacist network said oh you know like we should just close the borders to Chinese people because they're bringing coronavirus and you know the black that used to come from Chinese people anyway and as a Chinese person I obviously do not like that I am they are not going to tell you that they they're not going to tell you that they are Nazis they're not gonna tell you that they were white supremacists they'll just tell you that they want to return America to its majority white roots and I would roots I would like you to think about what that means and I would like you to think and I hope that you know that that face is a lie I just I just want to say that the moral questions of the last century was what if we had done something and here we are maybe there's not a legal way to say your beliefs are more than just beliefs they are potentially violent they have a plan and agenda but at the same time how can we legally spend so much time protecting them and then say it's not okay to say no this is a moral failure and it breaks my heart Arita okay all in favor of the approval authorization of the farmers market will - behavior please say aye aye any opposed not a lot of time remaining and the the food and beverage artisans have been been here many meetings now and coming back and waiting for us to reviews some information about their pricing structure which is really important to their getting ready for an upcoming market so we're gonna go over to c14 have Becky Higgins it's not a vote but a review good evening Becky Higgins recreation services division director staff is here to record our to request the board apart from insurers review the attached options for pricing of the food and beverage artisans for the 2020 farmers market staff will seek final approval at the March 24th 2020 board Park Commissioners meeting the following is a summary of different pricing options the various revenue lines are deposited into Farmers Market revenue so looking back food and beverage artisans have requested to lower the fees they pay to participate and solve the market in the past the fees included a weekly install fee ranging from ten to four hundred ninety nine dollars and ten percent of gross sales paid to the parks department monthly these revenues were designed to help farmers market meet their cost recovery goal of a hundred percent as set by the our commissioners this is the 2019 budget and in 2019 as a result of discussions between artisans staff and the park board approval the stall fees war removed and the food beverage artisans continued to pay ten percent of gross feed the food and beverage artisans requested lower fees in regards to the ten percent of gross revenue in order to be more equitable with foreign vendors the farmers market advisory council recommended to park staff that their fee be lower to five percent for our sales complete budget information for 2019 was not available at the time of that recommendation in consideration the park staff took a closer look into the budget information from 2016 to 2019 as well as the projected budget for 2020 in 2019 the cost recovery goal was not met in fact the budget operated out an overall deficit of fifty-five thousand two hundred and fifty dollars with the cost recovery of sixty three percent budget information used in the past several years was based on direct costs only if both direct and indirect costs were used which is what provides a complete picture of what it costs to run a program the cost recovery rates would have been lower than 100% for 20 16 17 18 and 19 lastly we are projecting that 2020 farmers market budget will operate at a deficit of thirty seven thousand seven hundred six dollars which equals a cost recovery rate of 76% in the past few years the farmers market has not met cost recovery goals to lower the feed more would only make it more difficult to meet these goals staff will continue to review costs yearly in prep any preparation for 2021 market season staff will review both farm vendor and food and beverage artisan fees in the effort to make these more equitable we ask the Park Board of Commissioners to review the proposed options for 2020 and determine what percentage of gross income be used for the food and beverage artisans examples of 10% of gross that's what's currently up there which shows a projected deficit of thirty seven thousand seven hundred and fifty six dollars in a cost recovery of seventy six percent and I would point out that the food the artisans proportion of the budget is 44 percent if you go to the next one which should be a six percent reduction or six or I'm sorry seven point five then the deficit is fifty thousand seven hundred and fifty-six dollars cost recovery drops to sixty eight percent and the food and beverage artisans would be paying 37 percent of the total income that comes from marquette if you go to the next slide it will show six percent of gross would equal yes yes so 6% would equal a deficit of 68 thousand five hundred and fifty six dollars and a cost recovery of sixty three percent with the artisans paying thirty two percent of the total overall revenue and then a five percent drop in the gross paid would equal a deficit of sixty-four thousand one hundred fifty six dollars in a cost recovery of fifty-nine percent with the artisans paying twenty eight percent of cost of revenue to market and then lastly we looked at what if there was a flat rate and if the boost paid about the same amount as farm vendors and you can see that drops us into a deficit of eighty one thousand four hundred and forty eight dollars in a cost recovery of forty eight percent so what we're doing is offering these options to you for you to take back review and then just let us know how it is you would like us to handle that the food and beverage artisans also requested and did receive their name change from prepared food vendors to the food and beverage artisans two seats at the farmers market Advisory Council which you voted on increased marketing and social media presence and addition to the farmers market overall mission statement I'd be happy to answer any questions okay thank you very much and I think the it's possible some of the prepared food vendors artisans would like to speak sorry so we have that but I wanted to start with the slides that we already have a bigger far that's okay let's start with two let's just do the five percent and then blackfeet once just the two okay okay I'm I'm Eric Sadler I'm a vendor at the Bloomington community farmers market with muddy fork bakery I appreciate you taking the time to consider our request again and we're gonna try to be as brief as we can I first just want to go back to the slide that Becky had this is the proposed 5% rate you'll see on the highlighted part towards the top that the prepared food vendors still contribute 28% of the budget and I want to remind everyone that we are 12% of the vendors so what we are asking for is equity and to pay the amount that it costs the market so you provide our space and then if you'll go on to the next one the flat fee and I I think the amount that you have on there might be less than what we proposed paying and this one we provide 11 percent of the budget out of 12 percent of the vendors then I want to go to the spreadsheet that I emailed you guys ahead at the meeting and hope you had a chance to look at it I just wanted to highlight how those different few levels can you see it how those different few levels affect the vendors and what we pay there we go okay okay okay so the first line there that's the average cost that we would be paying under those percents something that's important to recognize currently under 20 19's revenues which were down of course we paid on average 114 dollars a market and that's compared with $18 or $10 for a farm vendor and as you go down you see even at 5% we'd still be paying an average of 57 dollars per market which is above the costs that we estimate the market spends per person now let the rest of the people thank you they feed a flat fee after the 5% Columba so the last column is $37 flat fee which is what we estimated it actually costs per booth to operate the market it's not the same as the one that Becky put on the flat fee I think that was an $18 a week on her slide so hi Maria Bacolod OG maria callas RM so again we're here to ask you to try and follow the Farmers Market Advisory Council recommendation that was made in December of lowering the fee of the food and art and beverage artisans to 5% this year and then lowering down down to a flat fee for future years in order to reach a fair and equitable equitable financial responsibility among all vendors all the enders of the farmers market are equal we're not different we contribute to the farmers market to the success of the farmers market in equal way as much as every single farmer so we need to be treated equally the 10% fee applied to us on gross sale is unfair even under favorable market conditions that we had in the past it was still not enough to reach the hundred percent recovery cost that gives me the idea I mean the idea yet that this system will not work even if we sell tones of food we will still be struggling with the hundred percent recovery cost so that means that there's something wrong in the system and the financial system of this market that needs to change in addition the system is also very risky it's not resistant is resilient it relies heavily on only 12% of the vendors to get 50% last year of the revenues super risky the problem is very complex it calls for a new strategy and the new strategy should acknowledge the need for a more fair distribution of costs we need to start from there so please go see their desk okay thank you hi my name is Louise miracle I'm a vendor with pie first bakery and I we've had a lot of numbers kind of given back and forth here and I just wanted to say just in summary there are a hundred and four vendors at the market and approximately fourteen of us are the prepared where the food and beverage artisans so it's 14 of us we make up about 12% of the vendors but we account for around 52% of the of the revenue and you might ask well how is that possible it's not because we employ more people it's not because we're working any harder it's not because we're using up more and more ingredients or supplies for our products that we sell the reason that we have come up with the 52% of the venue of the of the revenues because we are taxed 10% which the growers have not been and that's really kind of it in a nutshell that's why we're asking you to get us in same line and on a line of equity with with the growers and thank you very much thank you good evening my name is Katie my Slawek and I don't need more coffee roasters and I'm a vendor at the Bloomington community farmers market and as you may remember last month one of the points that I wanted to just make clear to you guys was the fact that the we're not meeting the cost recovery but also the fact that it's like Maria has stated it's so risky because weather is one thing climb social climate is another thing that can't be predicted and if you're relying on a percentage of our sales as opposed to a flat fee like the vendors the farmers play a pay a flat fee and that means that the budget can be predicted as far as what they're going to pay and with ours you can't predict that and that does make it shaky and on top of that it's not fair or equitable so I would just like to ask that we get to a part where it's a flat fee so that the city can run the market in a predictable way and make it fair for everyone thank you thank you hello I would recommend to the board to vote to lower the fees I'm not a vendor myself but just someone who's you know concerned about them and you know I know that the person presenting it has talked about the need to like to make deficit or whatever and I think we have to think about what to cut as opposed to what to charge I'm not sure if the increase you know the 20 fold increase in policing has much to do with the farmers budget like I don't know if that's to do with the city or the parks but you know stuff like that is something to think about so you know there's a lot we don't agree on Kathleen but I'm you voted yes last time I watched the cats video for for like the last time this item was considered and I'm glad to see you vote to lower the fees again and I thank you Israel for abstaining and and looking more into the matters and and I hope less cons that you could you know have a better reputation with fairness and equity and that you vote to lower the fees not like last time we're you voted to keep them Thanks all right thank you hi there my name is Josh hermus I'm a vendor at the market with wild Alaskan salmon and seafood and just to kind of reiterate some of the points my fellow vendors have stated we're certainly not asking to you know you know wipe away all the fees we absolutely want to pay our way we just ask that it be in a more equitable and fair representation of the actual market I believe one of them stated that you know there's only 14 of us and we contribute a large part of the budget where the the revenue for the market comes from us it seems a little bit lopsided and I hope that you take that into consideration and thanks for your time thank you hi I'm Suzanne man okay yes yes please go ahead Suzanne man I'm a member of the Advisory Council but I'm here speaking privately and predictability I think is probably that real one of the words since everything else has been addressed a budget is something that be responsible to but Parks and Rec is a big department and you know moving money around is something that's very difficult to do but I'm sure that you deal with that a lot with the predictability I was thinking you have the Golf Course and if you have very rainy cold season no one's gonna play golf if it's very cold and rain you know it's gonna go to the pools and so you get less income from entities like that but you've not if you have a bad season you've not the prepared foods are coming in with who that they've made they purchased ingredients they made the food they come and there are no buyers or the weather is bad they take it on the chin because of the predictability is unpredictable so they go home and they eat a lot of whatever they have or sell it at are at a reduced rate but what the predictability if you can look at it as a whole department and just know that that it's it's it's a challenge for everybody and I hope that you can find the funds and move the funds around to make this more equitable okay thank you all right we were just reviewing on this issue and we've got great information from Becky now so we can discuss that and look at that more and come back to it at the next meeting and I think I think can can we can we rapid-fire through the staff and they all nodded their heads that they really okay to stay and get their approval now we'll see who's really dedicated thank you all right okay so we'll do a quick run-through then we're up to C for a review of the contract with Monroe Convention Center good evening I'm Ashley Spurgeon on the community events specialist and I recommend the approval of the

over time earth does settle and stones begin to show signs of Leaning or they completely tip over in order to prevent the headstones from disappearing into the earth or incurring damage from grounds equipment we do attempt to reset and or repair as many have stones as time and budget allows us to this annual process has been vital to the preservation of some of our city's most notable and historical markers and there's a photo I chose that photo because all three of those will be on the list for this year to be straightened those are very large ones and they require large equipment that Purcell brings in we typically can get twenty to thirty stones depending the larger they are the more expensive each stone is so typically anywhere from twenty to thirty stones are reseting straightened every year and I'm guessing by the look of those does go back to the 1800s yes okay yes you know these yeah late 18-hundreds exactly that's what that's in the old Spencer addition all right okay thank you all right any public comment or question seeing none all those in favor aye motion carried all right thank you barb and next we have a review of an alcohol permit for community a few could community events at Ruth's with shared Park hi Leslie Brinson community events manager I am here today to ask approval for sale of alcohol at the parks and recreation events taking place only at switchyard Park during 2020 staff will utilize outside vendors to provide alcohol permits secure serving areas where individuals 21 and over will able to purchase and consume their alcohol within designated areas the parks and recreation department would like to offer alcohol sale at specific events managed by the department and taking place at switchyard Park staff will work with outside vendors one at a time per event for the sale of alcohol these contracted vendors will be responsible for following requirements of our internal alcohol permit this includes obtaining an approved application from the state of Indiana alcohol and tobacco commission and providing a copy of that permit to staff prior to the event the contracted vendor will also be responsible for securing the service area where individuals 21 and over will be able to purchase the alcohol and consume it vendors will pay the department 10% of their gross sale on each event just as we do with other concession agreements events in which we would like to have alcohol sales include but are not limited at this point to trivia nights in the park the performing arts series concerts at switchyard Park movies in the parks at switch art and any yappy hour events at switch our dog park I'm happy to answer any questions so that will be yes for 2020 we are going to do it at during 2020 on a trial basis we a real reevaluate at that point and bring it back to you if it is successful or make changes at that point so right now we are just looking at 2020 and limit for at this point we would just be looking at one vendor per event and spreading those vendors out amongst the different vendors per events in the parks department will be providing the security and working through that component as well and just to note we've had some not exactly the same but similar situations I believe there was alcohol at garlic fest there has been people who have used special use permits in our parks have been able to come to you and ask special permission right for alcohol in the parks garlic Fest is one of those vehicles in Waldron bus gherkin Chumley yeah / 3rd Street Park yeah okay okay okay great thank you any public comment or question seeing none all those in favor aye motion carried all right Thank You Leslie and service agreements okay Turnbull all right and a sports division so this is a staff is recommending approval of seven service agreements and these service agreements will come out of regular general fund budgets in the sports division area for specific areas when and if the service is needed and the list here includes terminex International Steiner Sports Training Inc Keller Heating and Air Conditioning Inc deem Inc Steve's welding young's plumbing and mechanical and price electric and the background of this this is similar to a lot of service agreements that once we have these service agreements approved and on file then staff can contact any one of these service providers for the different areas that they work in for needs at facilities okay so as emergencies come up these red really sir the police absolutely all right great all right any public comment or question seeing none all those in favor aye motion carried all right and next we have T LRC front counter project yes from Megan stark yes Megan and I'm the membership coordinator for the Twin Lakes recreation center and I am requesting approval for the complete update in color scheme of our front lobby counter so the reconfiguration of cabinets some glass panels the flooring to be replaced and security system put on both of the front door and the back door so that it can be locked off from the public whenever it's not in use okay and is there a little bit more background about why updating the front counter area or yeah it looks nice lights so I believe that this will be the first time that it has been touched since at least we've had it so it's extremely worn it does not function well for the staff anymore one example is our front desk staff in the evenings have a large basketball program Bloomington youth basketball and to get the basketballs just because of how everything is configured within there they have to go all the way to the back almost to the concession stand to get a bag of balls for each coach that comes in and so it pulls them away from our front desk counter and doesn't allow them to do their job properly anyway okay and I will also add it's probably 21 years oh oh because we've owned the property for just over ten years and it was ten years old when we purchased it so it's time for an update okay I've been in a lot of fitness centers kind of largely on the west coast just to see what they look like and how they and to work out yeah no no I see how the customers respond to a six in total that's where they're doing a lot of this stuff and I came back here and looked at that and said this is gotta change if we're gonna be competitive and try to draw in customers and they have to see that it's not gonna work so this is just to be another effort to draw more people into this because of they just spent a lot of money cleaning the place putting not cleaning that putting new equipment in servicing the equipment this will actually match what our previous remodel of our upstairs locker rooms and then the upstairs weight room all of that the color scheme has been brought down stairs into the cardio studio and eventually will make its way down into our group exercise room so this will kind of make us a much more cohesive look when you walk in the door okay all right thank you thank you okay second any public comment or question seeing none all those in favor aye motion carried all right Andy Tuttle has Bloomington soccer and MC tennis I do I am D Tuttle I am the sports facility facility manager at Frank southern Ice Arena Winslow Sports Park the pools and Olcott Park so today I'm seeking approval of two new partnerships and the first one is the partnership agreement with the Bloomington Football Club to provide a soccer program at Winslow Sports Complex and the Bloomington Football Club has previously played at all cop Park Monday through Friday or Monday Wednesday and Friday and it's headed up by gentlemen of the name of Jeremy sweet and he provides soccer for the beginners and he also provides soccer for the more experienced player and they are wishing to move their program to Winslow Sports Park on one of the senior side fields playing two to four fields at once Monday through Thursday okay and I know there's been well just continues to be growth with the soccer program in town yes yeah all right yes right is the affordable and effective right he will be a user group of ours and so with this partnership agreement he sets a price and then he will pay so much per hour to rent our facility it has yes they have been a really really good user we think that this partnership agreement can do nothing but increase in numbers and it's just good for both sides okay thank you yes all right any public comment or question seeing none all those in favor aye all right motion carried and MC tennis yes the second partnership agreement is with MC tennis and this partnership is to provide tennis lessons at Bloomington high school south and/or Winslow Sports Complex so once again MC tennis wishes to provide affordable and effective youth and adult tennis lessons they had to have a lot of expertise in the sport of tennis it'll be headed up by Matt Corey which is the boy's head varsity coach at Bloomington South High School so we expect this program to grow in numbers the seasons progress and provide some income back to the parks department we will retain 20% of all of the registrations okay Matt Cory who will head the head the tennis program up so that he's adult youth youth an adult he will provide three different sessions a session in May a session in June and a session in July for adult beginner and intermediate players and then for youth beginner and intermediate right but not you know children yes youth children children ages 5 to 17 and then adults from 18 over we had yeah unless you know sports sports is cyclical and so in tennis we have seen a decrease in the lessons that we have actually offered to the public so our idea was with this is to bring some enthusiasm back into the sport and a larger exposure okay any public comment or question seeing none all those in favor aye motion carried Thank You D Thank You and poor Joanna sparks invasive plant removal is very
