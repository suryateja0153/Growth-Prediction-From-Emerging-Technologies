 we did it wrong before but we're gonna hopefully do it right this time. Welcome to the rediption. Hey, there's pennies down here. - [Nolan] That's mine. We bought two identical Nissan 350Zs and we've been modifying them to be fun daily drivers, that you can take to the track. - One Z gets expensive parts, mine cause I'm the baby (baby laughing) and one gets cheap parts. (fart) - Then we test them to see which components are actually worth spending your hard earned money on. - We've compared coil overs, breaks, tires, seats. - But today we are seeking to redeem ourselves. Plasti-dip offers many of the same benefits as vinyl wrapping, but for a fraction of the price. We tried Plasti-dipping low car previously and I didn't do the best job to say the least. I'm beside myself. This is the worst thing I've ever done. - Nolan did such a bad job that he put an entire industry in jeopardy. - Fonzie from DipYourCar.com reached out to us and said "hey, you're affecting my f***ing business, "please let me send you the correct stuff to do a good job." This kit is five hundred dollars, it comes with the correct spray gun and everything else we need not to mess up the job. - Except the the brains. - That's right. Spray bottles, we've got some dip-coat to make it look nice. Dip-remover, which we're gonna use all of. - This is a very comprehensive kit. Very nice product. So, let's see how Nolan's $500, DIY, driveway Plasti-dip compares to my $2600 professionally installed vinyl wrap. Does more expensive mean more better? It's the rediption. (upbeat drum music) - Last time we tried to dip the car, results kind of speak for themselves. So this time, we've got a new plan and we're gonna nail this thing. - Yeah, so first up we're gonna remove-- (car honking) f***ing. So there are three steps to this process, first we're gonna remove the dip, second we're gonna wash and prep the car and then third, we're gonna re-spray it. Let's do it. (bolts tightening) - Cha-ching. (liquid pouring) - What the f*** is this f***ing. - [James] Nah it's working. - Not really, I'm f***ing spilling everywhere. - [James] At least we're starting off on the right foot. - We're cleaning it and we already look like colossal idiots. - Oohhh. - I've been wanting to peel this off for so long. (plastic peeling) - This is very soothing. - This is gonna take forever, forever. - Problem is it was sprayed pretty thin in certain areas, so it's hard to get like that like. - Dude let's soak it and then spray it. - I'm down. - Yeah let's do it, let's push this out. Already, first step, you guys are not doing what the professional told you to do. This is why we're here the first place! I'm spraying it down with this dip-dissolver that came with the kit from DipYourCar.com, then we're gonna pressure wash it. (pressure washer humming loudly) - [Zach] It's so satisfying. - It's so great. Ahhh, Go Pro down! (James screaming) I got it. - Okay, I'm gonna spray that again - We're out of gas. - Ah s**t. So there's been a lot of opinions and tactics shared, and the one that we found to be the most effective was to spray one panel at a time, wait for the agent to really work itself into the dip, and once you can do this, it's time to spray. So let's spray. Eddie your hands are gonna get, ah anyway. - [James] Oh, yeah! - Yeah! When Nolan and Aaron are out there still power washing the car to get the Plast-dip off, so we're going to try to help them out and build them a little Dexter's room or a paint booth of sorts. Pretty makeshift, but it should keep from over spraying this whole shop, so it's beautiful. - Just got done pressure washing the car. It's really good, but what you don't see is the little things like this, so we're gonna wash the car, make sure we get all the stuff off the surface, because all that stuff is gonna show up when we re-Plast-dip the car, and we don't want to mess up our next job. (air hose blowing) - So we're all done for the day here on low-car. It's all finally washed. Tomorrow, we're gonna come back, we're gonna mask all the lights, we're gonna spray it with some pre-dip spray, and then finally, dip it. (mumbling) - So we're about to take the car to Vaderwerks to get all the new body kit pieces wrapped, but before we do that, we want to get a quick wash to get all the LA grime off of it, so the wrap can really stick to it. (upbeat music) - Gino, for the guys that weren't here the first time around, can you tell everyone why the wrap is better than things like Plasti-dip? - [Gino] Way better finish, glossier, more durable. If it's done right, it lasts forever. - And it's nice that we can just come and get it color matched without any issue. - [Nolan] It takes me, you know five days to do a car, and that's, you know full disassemble. So, I take bumpers-- - Take the whole thing apart, wrap everything individually, and that's what you did on this the first time, which I think is why it came out so well. - Yes, it's gonna look sick. - All right, so we're back. We let the car dry overnight, now we are masking off everything we don't want sprayed such as the headlights, and the windows. We're gonna take the hood off and just mask the engine bay and not worry about getting anything on our carbon fiber 'cause that would be a disaster. - Having done this once, it gives me a much better idea of the places that I want to improve on, such as like the edges and everything. Now when we mask, I'm actually pushing it up and over and then down into the crease. That way when we spray the Plasti-dip, it doesn't just sit over all the little rubber moldings and everything. Dude, you're not allowed to mask. The line looks great, but the tape over it looks like s**t. - You know this is coming off, right? - Yeah, but the line is gonna come off wrong. - So we have a phone call in about an hour with Fonzie from DipYourCar.com He's basically the master of Plasti-dip on YouTube as far as I'm concerned. Mr. Fonzie, how are ya? - I'm good brother, how are you? - Pretty good, nice to talk to you face to face. First, I want to apologize for doing such a horrific job last time around. - No apology necessary. I do appreciate you guys being willing to take another crack at it. - So we have the car mostly masked. We just had a few questions for you. We're gonna use your pre-dip spray, how far from the car are we going to hold the gun? What techniques should we use? - The distance doesn't really matter. It's really about being on one side of the extreme or the other. So you don't want to be way too close, where the product if going to pool up and start falling down the car, and you don't want to be way too far away, where the product is going to start drying in mid-air and then actually landing on the car in dry particles. After the roof, I'm focusing on one side of the car, - Gotta. - working from the top, down to the bottom, walking the length of the car. - We shouldn't worry about like number of coats, just the amount of product we use. Like we should go through all the gallons of the primer and the main color, correct? - Yeah, everything that I sent you is a car kit built for that car in that color. Spray the Avalanche Grey until it's done, and that's it. You just want to let it dry fully to the touch, so I'd give it maybe 20 minutes or so. - [Nolan And Aaron] Okay. - If you walk in and there isn't anything on the car that looks wet, you can go ahead and move on to your next pass. - Yeah, we have the right product and right tools this time, so I think it'll come out really, really well. - It's a great option for DIY customers to change the color of their car and it's not going to match up to a high-end paint job, but at least this time you'll get to experience what it's really like to use the right stuff. - Sweet man, dude thank you so much, seriously. - You're very welcome. - Ight, thanks Fonzie. - You're welcome. - Bye. (upbeat music) The car has been washed, masked, and prepped, and it looks amazing! I can't wait to get dippin'. So, first thing we gotta do is mix up our base coat of Avelanche Gray with the included mixer here. Then we're gonna strain our paint through the included cone filter to make sure there's no impurities in the dip. Then we'll put it on our gun, connect it to air, and get spraying. We're gonna do a test panel. (paint spraying) Something's, something's off. So we're gonna try to get a few test sprays going inside when it's not so freaking windy. (Nolan chuckles) (paint spraying) That's so much better. - Remember, you're never gonna start spraying over the car. So, you'll start spraying before you hit your panel, and then spray through it. You good with it, you confident? - Think so. - Okay. - If we see anything, we'll just stop and just start over. - Cool. (paint spraying) - There's specs in it. That's the same thing as last time. - I think it's okay, man. - The breather hole might be f***ed. You see, it like, it'll go and then it'll turn off and then go again. That's not, that's not what we want. That's what happened last time. It was just not consistent, like you can see it's all patchy and gross. - Nolan just picked up something really important. He noticed the inconsistency in the spray, we thought maybe the breather hole was clogged, but what we found was that the pickup tube was actually cracked, which is drawing air in and making it spray inconsistent. So, we gotta fix that before we start and finish anything else. (suspenseful music and paint spraying) Dude, you gotta back up, man. - God d***it, dude, f**k! I got too close and it pooled up a lot, and that's exactly what it looked like last time we did it on the other side of the car, and I'm f***ing pissed. Dude, this looks awful. It looks identical to what happened last time. - So I say we let it dry, f***in' peel it off, re-prep that door, and go from there. The pressure's on, you know, so we need to chill out, take our time spraying it. I always feel like if you spray a little bit, you can always add more, but you can never take it off once you've sprayed it. So, as long as Nolan backs up a little bit and gets a nice, consistent spray pattern, even if we have to do two more coats of the primer, at least it's not puddling up. I believe in him. - Hey, should we call Fonzie? - No. (upbeat music) - What are my thoughts? I think so far, so good. It looks really even, it looks like a primered car. I definitely don't want to laugh, which was my reaction last time they dipped the car. - I think we're getting better with every coat. It's looking a lot better than it did the last time around. - [Aaron] I'm pumped, man. - We still have to lay the color down, okay. - [Nolan] We're only about halfway there. - Let's not go tootin' all the horns just yet. - All right, so the primer is all over the Z. It is now time to reveal the new low-Z color. Aaron, would you do the honors. - I'm on it. (drum rolling) - It's Force Teal from DipYourCar. I think it is a really nice color. It's a nice evolution of the blue low-car motif that we've been going with, but this kinda spices up the hot boy factor a little bit. (upbeat music and paint spraying) All right, so the Z is dipped and now Aaron and I must get all the masking off, favorite part. - It's really important to pull all the masking tape off of the Plasti-dip as soon as possible because we don't want it to dry to a point where when we go to peal the actual tape off, it pulls the dip up with it. The quicker you can get the tape off, the less chance of that you have happening. - I'm just going around with a razor blade, trying to cut any connection between the tape and the dip. - It's leaps and bounds better than before. I'm so proud of the boys. - So the last step for the car is to wipe it down with some dip-coat. What this does is it kinda protects it from scratches, and marks, and water spots, and stains and that kind of thing. It gives it a little more slicker feel as well. We're just gonna give it a nice wipe down and then come back on Monday morning and hopefully it looks really, really good. (rock music) - It's Monday morning, 9:00 am, we're back at Vaderwerks to pick up the Z. - I can't wait to-- - Excited to see how it looks. - Yeah, this is uh, f**k I wasn't gonna say anything, I just started talking (mumbling) - Let's go take a look! (car engine roaring) - Good lookin'! That is good, dude. - What have we done? - (chuckling) We've made a great 350Z. Dude this is awesome, this is awesome. Thanks so much. - Yeah, no problem. - All right, let's go see what those boys did. (tapping on the car) - All right, so the car has been curing all weekend at the shop, we've put the wing back on, so now it's time to for you guys to decide if we rediped ourselves. (upbeat music) The car looks incredible, and that's really because we learned a lot from last time, you know. - [Zach] Dude, so good with the carbon fiber hood. It looks so good, dude! - I can't stop looking at it, you know. Just looking back at low-car now, like when it has the crumby paint and we referred to it as low-car, that was because it was like just like a pile of crap. - It looked like a pile. - And we kinda disrespected it a little bit, but now it looks great. - [Zach] Yeah, now you realize it's really a decent car. - Yeah, it looks like a video game car. - Dude, if you showed me that car when I was 15, I'd lose it. - Ah, game over. - [Nolan] But together these things just look so cool. - [James] They're brothers. - This thing's a freaking monster. The hood looks, so good. Were you guys getting a lot of looks coming up here? - [Zach] I have no visibility in this car. (laughing) It's like wild looking, but it's still very mature. Have you ever seen a harder pair of Z's? - We built these things, that's so cool. And we're not even done yet. - Now it's time to get more power, baby. - That's right. (upbeat music) (car engine revving) - So, does more expensive mean more better? Finally, we have a decent example of both to actually compare, Nolan. - You know, I'm not really sure. I really like how the dip came out this time. - To have, I would still rather have a car that is vinyl wrapped. It's still 100 percent reversible. I think it looks better, I like shiny stuff. But, if I had to choose which one I was gonna do, I would definitely choose spraying Plasti-dip on my car. There is no way I could do a wrap job as good as Vaderwerks did on my car. - It was $500, all in, to change the color of the Z. But now that we have the equipment, all we need to buy-- (loud thumping) oh my goodness. Now that we have the equipment, all I have to buy in the future is just more dip and just keep doing it until you find something that you really, really like. It's really, it's really cool. So James, I guess I, the only thing I have left to ask is did I redip myself? - You know Nolan, every once in a while, you do something so awful and stupid, but then you come back and totally redip yourself! - Yes! - [Children] Yay! - I think you did a great job, you should be proud. - Thank you. - We have a really, really exciting episode next week. We're gonna finish up our turbo kits with a fueling system. We're adding injectors, you're getting a new fuel pump. - That's right. - Let us know if you're team high or team low with the hashtag up or hashtag down arrow, and let us know in real life with your team high or team low stickers available at donutmedia.com - Nice plug. - We've got a bunch of new stuff cookin', a bunch of new shows. We got this new show called Money Pit, hosted by team high teammate, the-- - The blue-eyed devil himself, Mr. Zach Jobe. Be kind. - I love you. - See you next time. (clap) (upbeat music)
