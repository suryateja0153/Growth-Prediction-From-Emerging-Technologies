 WITH YOUR LOOK AROUND THE AIR FORCE, I’M SENIOR AIRMAN ANGELO ROSARIO. CONGRESS CONFIRMED LIEUTENANT GENERAL DAVID ALLVIN AS THE NEXT AIR FORCE VICE CHIEF OF STAFF. HE’LL RECEIVE HIS FOURTH STAR AS GENERAL, AND TAKE OVER THE POSITION FROM GENERAL STEPHEN WILSON, WHO HAS SERVED AS VICE CHIEF SINCE 2016. GENERAL ALLVIN MOST RECENTLY SERVED AS THE DIRECTOR OF STRATEGY, PLANS AND POLICY FOR THE JOINT STAFF AT THE PENTAGON. CHIEF OF STAFF, GENERAL CQ BROWN SAYS GENERAL ALLVIN HAS SET THE STANDARD FOR CRITICAL COLLABORATION WITH ALLIES AND PARTNERS WHEN IT COMES TO LEADING AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS. GENERAL BROWN AND ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF GENERAL JAMES MCCONVILLE CAME TOGETHER TO DISCUSS HOW THE AIR FORCE AND ARMY CAN BETTER COMBINE EFFORTS AND ASSETS TO FURTHER THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMBINED JOINT ALL-DOMAIN COMMAND AND CONTROL, OR C-JADC-2. BOTH SERVICE CHIEFS AGREED TO ESTABLISH C-JADC-2 AT THE MOST BASIC LEVELS WHILE DEFINING STANDARDS FOR DATA SHARING AND INTERFACING. ARMY DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF LIEUTENANT GENERAL CHARLES FLYNN ECHOED A MESSAGED GENERAL BROWN HAS USED OFTEN, WHICH IS THAT THE FUTURE FIGHT WILL BE MUCH FASTER, AND THE JOINT FORCE WILL HAVE MORE SENSORS AND MORE SHOOTERS FOR DATA TO BE WIDELY DISTRIBUTED. C-JADC-2 COMBINES THE AIR AND SPACE FORCES’ ADVANCED BATTLE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WITH THE ARMY’S PROJECT CONVERGENCE. THE B-1B LANCER BOMBER IS ONE OF THE MOST LETHAL AIRCRAFT IN THE AIR FORCE INVENTORY, AND HAS BEEN A PART OF OPERATIONS FOR 34 YEARS. THE AIR FORCE IS SPONSORING A PROJECT WITH WICHITA STATE UNIVERSITY’S NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF AVIATION RESEARCH, OR NIAR, TO CREATE A VIRTUAL COPY OF THE LANCER WHICH WILL PROVIDE A VIEW OF ANY ISSUES WITH THE AIRCRAFT BEFORE THEY EVEN HAPPEN. THE NIAR TEAM IS STRIPPING DOWN AN OUT-OF-SERVICE LANCER AND PERFORMING A COMPLETE SCAN OF EACH PART TO CREATE THE VIRTUAL COPY. THE ENTIRE PROCESS WILL TAKE ABOUT SIX YEARS TO COMPLETE, BUT IN THE END WILL HIGHLIGHT STRUCTURAL FAILURES OR POTENTIAL DAMAGE. ONE ENGINEERING LEADER SAYS HAVING A DIGITAL TWIN OF THE LANCER IS REVOLUTIONARY AND WILL SUPPORT THE LANCER’S CONTINUED USE THROUGH 2040. AND THAT’S YOUR LOOK AROUND THE AIR FORCE.
