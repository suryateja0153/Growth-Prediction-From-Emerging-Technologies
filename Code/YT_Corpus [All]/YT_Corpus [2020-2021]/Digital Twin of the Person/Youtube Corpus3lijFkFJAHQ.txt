 Hi! I'm Meghan and I'm Faith and we are the founders of Virtual Teaching Tactics As teachers ourselves, our mission is to investigate the many facets of digital education and share our thoughts and ideas with the teaching community. We know that there is a lot to learn and adapt to but we are really excited to explore and learn together. Welcome back to Virtual Teaching Tactics. Today we will be discussing live online classes or LOCs which are useful when you cannot meet with your classes in person but you still want some sort of interaction between you and your students. In order to show you how this works, we are in our own homes and coming to you via an online platform. Many districts are also using terms like blended learning and hybrid education which will also most likely require the use of an LOC. There are some guidelines that can help you when using this new platform. For this video, we are using Zoom but we will access additional LOC platforms and other videos as we dive deeper into this format.
