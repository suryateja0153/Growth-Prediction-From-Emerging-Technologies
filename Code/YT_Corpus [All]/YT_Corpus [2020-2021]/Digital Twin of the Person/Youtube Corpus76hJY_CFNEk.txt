 hi all I'm dance McBride founder that we get around Network forum today is Thursday April 23rd 2020 and you're watching wgan TV live at five we have a great show for you today super geeky this is mater this is automating and exporting matter port matter tags and exporting matter port labels we have a subject matter expert on the topic today is Scott McKenzie hey Scott good to see you today okay Scott is the the director of home plan in Lower Hutt New Zealand and Scott your company home plan has automated some tools to facilitate the the automating of matter port of automating exporting of matter port matter tags and importing matter port matter tags before we kind of do a little bit deep dive into actually how this works why would I need to be able to automate importing and exporting matter port matter tags thanks Dan our experience with meta port since we started our enterprise about a year and a half ago was that it provided a very easy to use in a high quality platform on which to do numerous things a lot of those things though are or were originally designed to be done at small scale thinking of normal real-estate usage and meta tags we thought were a very good solution to pointing out features within a house for sale we took a slightly different angle on the use of meta port and use it for condition inspections party inspections users that would see you have not three or four meta tags and a meta poor digital twin you might have fifty or hundred or even hundreds of these however the problem is using the standard medical interface as there you need to manually create these one by one so we given that the models we were creating were very popular and people were liking the functionality we sit down a path to automate so even before we talk about the automation when might I have a hundred mater texts 200 mater tax so a couple of examples starting at maybe a slightly smaller level our condition and speech and service that we do we use the meta tags for two purposes one is a 3d walkthrough only shows you what the camera can see it doesn't show you the inside of the oven it doesn't show you behind the curtains and those are useful things to capture if it's a condition inspection or a high coverage scenario so by the time you go through an average house and take photos of all those areas you might find you've got thirty to forty meta tags and the great thing once you've done that is now you've got a complete coverage of that property rather than just what's shown in the 3d if I scale that up just a little bit more the next use case is to then use those meta tags to point out any condition problems any flaws traffic like type system this is green this is orange this is read any scratches and the walls so that might lift you from having thirty to forty meta tags to having 50 to 70 to 100 meta tags and a normal sized house and we have found that that's a very popular use of the meta port model being used for a condition inspection prior to a tenant taking over if we jump up again we now start talking about virtual online stores customers who want to be able to walk down the actual aisle of the store click on a button that brings up a product and have it taken to a shopping cart now that has not been widely implemented at the moment he's been based Madhupur functionality because of course the only way to update your product and your prices is to manually edit every meta tag on the way through whereas using our service we can now hold that information offline Andry important as it needs to be updated all through one third one actually and this is getting into the bigger stuff we've got construction based scans or digital twins that have over 500 scan positions up to a hundred scan positions we use the meta tags for wayfinding so we drop a tag in each room and then we use Impe embed to search on those you can quickly jump to the room that you want and of course you may have seen previously our digital or virtual symmetry that we did which uses meta tags to pinpoint the location of every gravesite and includes a photo of each headstone and makes it searchable again through India so you've talked about a lot of use cases I think I heard construction documentation in there too yes facilities management yes products for sale and you know I think when you mentioned that and you talk about hundreds of products for sale I would imagine if you're thinking about adding matter matter port matter tags if you're thinking about adding a hundred or more if you're thinking about adding 10 or more matter port matter tags I think of a very manual operation yes certainly so I'll come back to construction but maybe just talking about the shopping cart type scenario I'm probably telling people what they know but the way an online store works is that you have a storefront that is easy for a user to work with and sitting in behind it and you have a database that has all the products their images their prices their descriptions and through the metric of computers that connects the two so that when a user clicks on a certain selection or searches they're able to add that to their shopping cart now that same theory can apply to a medical digital twin now so the front end it becomes the virtual tour and then we are able to hold a database in the background and use it to update the tags there are also methods using the SDK - that on demand our proper service locks of them - the meta tags and you they don't honor a frequent or repeated basis it's a use me Scott this is using the matter port SDK to help automate dynamic pricing yes it is DK as a brilliant hook we use it we have some custom developments using it however it's not accessible to the average meta port customer so there are certainly better ways to fully integrate using SDK what we're doing is using the base medical viewer functionality and the Meditec functionality and linking it to a new service that means you can use it on a wider number of use cases and that you wouldn't have thought of before so we did with the the matter port matter tags URL link to a specific place within a shopping cart yeah I can show you a live example of that if you like I would while you maybe while you're calling that up earlier today I was talking with a matter port service provider in the United States and he is in the midst of having a discussion with some big-box retailers where the anticipation is having a need to upload nine hundred matter tags and and this is not even just for one store this is for multiple locations in the United States and he's scratching his head you know trying to figure out is this doable is it practical is it something that he can even price out because he's thinking about Wow 900 matter tags this is really a very laborious and tedious process it's a great tool but when you start talking about big numbers it almost becomes impossible to think about from an operational standpoint of how one might manually add 900 matter tax so I said hey you might want to tune in to our show today WGA and TV live at five our guest will talk about automating the importing and exporting of matter tax and I would likely imagine that includes connecting it to the shopping cart so that if you want to have a store and literally put a tag on every product that's available for sale that that process is not going to be as hard as he might have thought about when originally trying to price out his project and I said hey if you thought about pricing out your project you've already accounted for all your labor oh by the way here's a way that you could do this to save yourself a lot of time and effort so that's the filter that I'm looking through right now when you show me what you're about to show me related to matter tax meat shopping sure and this is not a live example it's just a demo environment so please excuse that it's relatively casual and some other things that it's showing I'll just bring that screen up just checking that's on your screen now yes thank you so we're actually looking here at the home plan office that we work out of it's been under lockdown for a month now so I hope it still looks like that today we've actually prod this an a an a super market based walkthrough but it's just not ready to show you but this will show you the theory and this particular walkthrough which was done very quickly for test purposes you'll see that we've created a room label that is the equivalent of an aisle and then we've gone ahead and imported a set of data and you can see down the middle of the room here we've got these tags now we can determine how long the stims are we can determine where they go on the model we can even play with the colors in fact you'll see here we've got some tags that are black and then a white which you can't actually do in metaphor you can have this standard 16 colors and then each tag itself using the standard tag functionality that has a title it has a description that can include URL links and it has an image associated with it so here we are looking at a Huggies product that has a price and has a description it isn't here's a link if you want to jump into the online store to look at other diapers and training dents and of course effort is the product that we're looking for we can click it and take it through to a online store or shopping cart which you may not be able to see through the screen share now if I look down that line you'll see this is just a test set up you see we've got bananas and we've got rooms and we've got all the great things in life it's issue the New Zealand cheese that we can have there and we just repeated that test you can see the functionality so if you could imagine that this particular model was a it was a supermarket digital twin then we would be dropping in these tags into the middle of the aisle and the only piece of menu work required us to drag and drop those tags to their final position which is a very quick and easy process once you're used to doing it okay well so this might be a good good point to say well how did those tags get there yeah I'll jump over to a different screen excuse me from my own technical and competence if this takes a moment to do yeah you're doing great so I should mention that while you're getting set up that you took us through a matter tag that included a label description color the media URL to anchor the the stem details which I think also included the color of the top of the matter tag it correct so when you eat it meta tags gives you a number of things that you can define the color the link to the stem the description and what's on the screen now if that has come through is and I've just opened up in Microsoft Excel this is the data that sits behind the tags and through our service were able to export the stage route of an existing model or we can create it from scratch to load into a model for the first time this particular data set does not have any existing anchor positions so if we were taking data out of a model this would actually tell you a coordinate for where those meta tags came from which is important if you're reloading tags they can and has I almost nonsensical code that represents the color that map's through two different colors using RGB palettes then we have the stuff that you see sorry I'll just try and move across so you have the description of a method tag and it looks a little bit technical but there's different ways within a description to have a URL link to a shopping cart or to other items to a PDF file all those things you have the title of that tag and then you have the link of that through to a particular online media if you're looking at to a video we also get to choose the length of the stem which I don't know about other users we really hate the steam length a little slider you have to use the sobs that we just set up to a preset and it will go in at that length and stay there when you drag it around and then we have a way of mapping our tags to different room labels so you can import it to one room or the other as you come in cook so I imagine that if I'm if I'm uploading for the first time you provide some template to say hey here's the template put your data in in this google in this excel sheet for the purpose of being able to import the data yes absolutely so that the two primary use cases there that someone wants to take tags out of one model and put them into another version of that same model so in that case we can export the data which gives you the format and it can be adjusted and then we can reload it what would be the use case of why I have a I have two identical matter port spaces one of which already has matter tags and the other one that doesn't why do i when would i want to move matter port matter tags from one matter port space to another good question so a couple of different scenarios which some are easy and some are hard the easy scenario is when a model has been uploaded once and then it's had to be uploaded a second time now that might be because there was a trimming error in it there was some other navigation problem that made you go back and say actually I just need to make an adjustment on the iPad and now uploaded a second time the same applies and there's been quite a lot of chat on your forum previously about this is that the medical engine gets better over time and if you captured something a year ago and submitted a year ago versus submitting it now you'll actually get a better result now so allows you to go back to as old models and resubmit them now and all those scenarios you probably spend minutes days hours whatever doing post-production on that original model and you want to try and carry those settings forward into the new model and we're talking about matter port matter tags and maybe labels labels you can export I'm not sure you can import the labels we can export labels we can't import them but it's not actually a hard thing and the pipeline we're looking at things like full replication of all settings from one model to another ah one day because I'm thinking about that pain point I worked on a museum I've tricked it out I put in all my matter tags I got labels on or matter I should sit since they're different I'll say I have matter tags on every display case in the museum on every painting I have a complete description I've worked with my client I and now my client has said great I'm gonna take it to my boss and the boss says hey can I see that spray or whatever you call it outside the front door can you get rid of that and now I'm thinking oh my gosh I have to reprocess my model and manually move every one of those texts so so my pain just went away because I can have home plans matter tag solution export the tags and import them into that a virtually identical model correct and our that matter tag is going to end up in exactly the same place I mentioned before there's a bit of a catch so you have the same base model and in effect it's a duplicate of it the tags will generally go to the exact same place however a phrase I've started users that meta book will be what medical will be and at times will decide to change its underlying coordinates just slightly and 99% of the cases so far the same model they will go back to the exact same place now I mentioned before a a related use case which is probably more common which is where you go back to the same property and scanner a second time so construction you might be there scanning it at different stages of fit out or pre-fit out and post fit out now it is still possible to export the tags from an earlier model and then load it into a later model but there's a good chance that it will all be offset slightly off to one side it'll still have the same dimensional relationships between the tags but they might just all be selling off to the side a little bit and then again as metaphor being my head of work will be so in those cases we can then go through we just work out what the Delta is and do some adjustments there to pull those positions back so they have an only more common on Delta meaning the change of everything moved over an inch so now that we know that we can adjust for that it's more likely to be 3 or 4 feet but yes exactly that once we know because it keeps the relationship of the tags to each other the same then you can just change the offices on the entire set for it ok so what would be a reason in let's say weekly construction documentation where matter tags were used I I would imagine to communicate to the various trades to say okay we got heating and plumbing questions we got electrical questions we have mechanical questions the next week that same space was reshot again is there a reason to bring forward all those matter tags certainly that's up to the users to define but what we're trying to align here is that it's similar to a one-to-one one-to-many many-to-many type relationship you might have one metaphor skin and relays that you've got tags that want to change over time or you might have the opposite you might have multiple meta port scans of a property that you want to relate to one static set of manta tags over time and every iteration between so in that construction example they might simply want to use the meta tags for wayfinding so that every room has a tag on it and using MP embed and its search features so they can type in a room number or code and be taken straight to that room regardless of which model they are looking at if you flip it the other way it might be that the tags were used to to highlight issues and I can show you an example of that on a residential scale if you like sure let's take a look at that while you're calling that up I guess I guess what I was thinking about on the construction documentation is that perhaps one model is sent off to the electrical team one model sent off to the plumbing team one model is sent off to the safety team one model in and so everybody maybe identifying different issues but I imagine the the leadership team wants to see all those and they might want to see them all together in one model so would that be an example of a use case is to say oh sure each of these different trades mechanical electrical plumbing or MEP all put down their issues but now the the pain and suffering the thought of moving 50 tags from one model to 50 from here 50 from here and 50 from here to get to the hundred and 50 so that the executives can see all the problems and issues at the same time that just seems like too big a pain point that for anyone to manually deal with that either either by time or the expense of that time to do that so you actually have a solution that maybe creates even a new use case for matter port weekly construction documentation by enabling the the model a different version of the exact same model to go to different constituencies to do their piece of the puzzle then have it come back to the to whoever is managing the the the project there may be the general contractor may be the photographer for the general contractor yes I wouldn't want to push the default meta port functionality as the replacement for a proper defect management system it's just not complicate enough for that certainly with the SDK it is the ability to create that and future what this allows you to do is rather than when you get to that point of deciding you want to present what you know it used to be oh my god I've got to correct these things manually and therefore they would discount it as an option now what they can do is assemble their data and in a preset format and load them through so the time it takes us to create a hundred Turner tags is probably the time it would take a normal person to create ten tags so it opens up a new use case and the scenario that you're outlining it might be you've got three or four contractors and either using a defect management system or multiple defect management systems they've got the data collected but it's not shown in 3d what our service allows them to do is then stockpile it into one place and load it and once and then view it through the 3d model so I'm like way over my head into in terms of subject matter expertise but it sounds like someone's collecting a lot of data I'm guessing that if it's not in an Excel sprig spreadsheet it's in a database a relational data if it's not in a flat file it's in a relational database if it's in a relational database it probably means it's possible to export it to a flat file like we think of Excel and then if you can get to Excel then you have a way to then import in in using the home plan matter port matter tag engine a way to now bring data into a three dimensional world so to get your life you've got it right I'm so I'm literally tingling because as soon as I went through that workflow I'm going this is pretty crazy and exciting because it's it's disruptive in a really exciting way for a general contractor we're the project's large enough that there are what did you call it a construction a that what's the the term for this the defect management system for the defect management system the data exists someplace but I'm such a visual person boy what I just love to see that within the three-dimensional model as opposed to within an Excel spreadsheet as a punch list so this sounds like it's trance transformational in a disruptive good way to enable possibilities that maybe people haven't thought about except you I'll give you a live example then I'll show you the result of it this is what we do internally then actually lead to us developing this service or these tools we use a inspection tool called eye auditor now that's a very common tool worldwide it's very easy to configure very flexible and in that tool when we go to a sites to do condition inspections we first of all scan it using the metaphor camera we then go around it with our iPad and the eye auditor app and we will say whether the room is in good condition or not we'll take photos of specific condition issues we'll take photos of inside the oven behind the curtains all those things now I or audit are saves that information into its database that database can be accessed by API or it can just be exported as a flat file as a CSV now we've now got a transformation built that allows us to take that data as it's stored in I or deter and reformat it into the CSV format that is needed for the tag importat all so used to take us an hour on site to capture the information and then an hour to two hours off site to recon all the information and create the condition inspection walkthrough and now takes us an hour on site and it takes us about 15 minutes off site to create the outcome that I'm about to show you awesome I'd love to see you okay his web straight cut off yes okay so we're looking now at a space we use WP 3d a great front-end tool and we use it to distribute what we do to our clients the second was a second so we're speaking a little bit in shorthand so for when you say WP three DWP 3d we're actually talking about WP 3d models WordPress plugin and that's what you're using to create this page that we're looking at that includes both that includes the the matter port digital twin there was some text information a map photos it looks like a floor plan or site plan below that great so this is actually what you're showing is home plan an integration using WP 3d models for the visual storytelling that you're doing with a client yes correct and the most common use case for this particular plugin WP 3d is to present a public web page of a property for sale or to help advertisers we use the functionality with a bit of customization to actually use it as a digital property record so we create a table here and we record whether we have one or multiple walkthroughs for this property any associated 2d imagery and the ability to download all of that and one go for our clients so if I was to click this open button it would open up the walkthrough and another window yes you and it's going to open up the window for the specific road that you're looking at so you can could it the prints a little bit small could you just give us an example of one of those rows and how that access button works yes sure so I'm not sure off that zoom and help yeah I think but this is what we're about to look at it's actually the walkthrough at the top of the screens that's a bit easier but it was captured on the 2nd of March its status is active and if I click on this it'll open it up in a new window then we have the Associated files that go with us then we can also open I'll come back another time down and talk about this because this is actually the gateway to our open archive development that's coming so in time you'll see that that's archived and we'll have a way to actually open and provide access to archived metaphorce guardian you know that excuse me for talking over you if you could just pause one second there when you showed me this page I was immediately realized that that was a WP 3d models WordPress plug-in created page that said where you have your open button that was the first time that I've seen a an interactive button added to WP 3d models so kudos to you to figure out how you did that to accomplish what you're about to show thank you moving into the content itself this is a as a small property and central Wellington in this case we did not do a marketing walkthrough it was just a condition inspection and I'll just stand somewhere they can get the general sense of what we've done so you see here we've got meta tags on a relatively wide scale and they are color coded purple represents just a feature for an example we have a very easy floor plan in this case sitting in that model which which we link at and we then have read for bed orange for an issue and green for good so on this on this wardrobe for example we have incorporated a photo that allows them to see the inside of that photo for inspection purposes and then achieves a higher level of coverage than just a stand and walk through would otherwise allow you to see so for clarification Scott Howard how is the content for these tags created and how did it end up in this model that that is the ending process that we have built so I'll just describe it rather than jumping between lots of windows when we are on site we did as all meta port users would went here and created a 3d scan then when we had finished that we use the I orders at all to go around and capture the content of all of these tags then when we get back to the office we proptosis the model and we link the two together we export the data from our auditor which we're going to automate a job that does it and then we used our import tool to then load the man and dropped all the tags down the center of the room and then our job was to them drop them to their final resting position which takes about two or three seconds per tag today so if I took you off screen sharing for a moment there so Scott if I'm a matter port service provider I'm looking for new opportunities for my scanning to help maybe help differentiate myself from another matter port service provider if if I kind of if I if I kind of can figure out who's doing property inspection and and it sounds like if if your property management company and you're managing maybe Airbnb rentals that sound like a an example yes there have been days less popular these days right now okay so in in a normal world like oh if I have properties I'm thinking of I'm a property management company and maybe people are vacationing for the week so I have a lot of people that move out on a Saturday and I have a lot of people to move in on a Sunday is that an example where that proper that that documentation is going to take place in in order to catch any and and and and maybe maybe I'm using the wrong maybe it's not it's an it's not a vacation rental apartment it's a vacation it's a luxury vacation rental home and someone is managing lots of those properties at a beach destination and somebody's coming in with this app taking a lot of pictures in order to note is there as the as the oven a trainwreck is help me out here help me understand this space yes you're definitely on the right track but for cost efficiency and typically applies to long-term rentals so people who do not own their own homes who are renting now there is a landlord somewhere who owns that property and there's a handshake agreement that happens at the start when you move into a rental property the tenant and the landlord are agreeing what the condition of that property is at that point in time when that tenant moves out in six months a year two years they'll then reassess did you actually cause any damage to this property that you now need to repair before you go on your way now that process was before we entered into this market was predominantly done through 2d methods taking hundreds of photos and the photo they eventually needed was the one they forgot to change so what we do is take one really big photo using the 3d digital twin then we supplement us with 2d photos and we get as close as possible hundreds in coverage and then we point out the things that are relevant for them and that led us into a very successful launch of our services here in New Zealand but did create a an overhead because they were required to create the meta tags to allow that service to work was cumbersome and that's what opened us in to this development pathway and that's why we share it now with others so if they want to look at doing this as a service that gives them a way of making it more efficient for them to use the meta tags this is awesome hearing so as a matter port service provider in New Zealand you you had this opportunity that involved both matter port and this this documentation and you realized if you put the two two together one plus one equal to hundred it didn't equal one plus one equal one it really was something powerful and I could also imagine when you did that digital twin the digital twin could be used to help rent out that long-term rental even while somebody was living there because now they've said hey we're moving out and maybe maybe not you have the the benefit of somebody walking into the space maybe it's a long-term rental from someone that doesn't even live in New Zealand so now you have this digital twin to show off the space and then in parallel you have a digital twin that has all this documentation that essentially when the the long term renter now says I'm moving in there's documentation at that move in of what that the condition of the space looked like a decorated and you could standardize that and our examples we are going s you by issue you could have one tagged per wall or per surface and then you can actually export use that as a standard format and export that and re important to future copies of that model for that property yeah this is awesome I'm so excited visiting with you on the sky I you know I call sitting down at a conference here in Atlanta with the property management company not for the vacation but as you're describing they rent out homes and here in Atlanta that company might be responsible for renting out three hundred homes it never occurred to me that there was somebody that had a document what the condition of that property was for the purpose of when that person moves out you know did they materially change the space outside the scope of what that lease agreement was so that that's this field called property documentation the property management this property management property documentation so where I might have only been thinking of Oh matter port matter port matter port I can I can help them lease that space okay well actually I now have yet a whole nother service that I can be offering is using that app that you're describing which they're probably already using that app is the show where the value of overlapping the two together creates this value presumably of being able to one have a record but to have the documentation of all the things that need to be fixed before it gets rented out again yeah absolutely and so do you pull that as a punch list of constructions a punch list because you is there to be fixed often it's just a record of what's wrong but maybe to lift that conversation up to what this actually means to those who do this for a living this is just a particular use case that when we started and others started it just using manual method creations we've done 300 of these in the last six months and if we were not using our own service to automate alongside a auditor to do 300 models and tag them with 50 100 models in each one of them you're probably talking between three six even eight hundred hours worth of work with our tools and play now that's probably a hundred hours worth of work yeah I think we really hope you get up yeah it's probably a couple things going on that run through my mind first is it attacked your tool is actually making it practical because if you had to build the 800 hours for something that that really should be a hundred hours it that the project might collapse just on the cost itself because it's such a labor-intensive process so certainly that's both time and and and money associated with the time because somebody's got to bill out that time but what I'm also hearing when you describe this I you know again if I'm a matter port service provider and I'm looking to differ in I ate myself then I got something that others probably don't because I know about home plan automation for matter port matter tags to get it out of that relational database of the app in into that CSV file to be able to import into matter port and now I have kind of like a secret sauce that I can offer that perhaps somebody else doesn't even isn't even aware of that solution well I don't want to get into because we could have a very long discussion on meta port scanning services and what that means for the industry but these are examples where image peas and others can offer value add services that differentiate themselves from vanilla delivery of medical digital twins and we're just going to be smarter I mean there there is a market out there for what meta port is trying to do I get that our job is to be one step ahead of the game they've given us this platform that can do some wonderful things some of those things they are not doing themselves our job is to put those in front of customers and attract them to our services yeah so I love you know you said make it smarter value and you know that this is really elevating the the value of a matter port service provider of adding a huge amount of value to that digital twin if I can go back just for a moment to to my conversation earlier today I'm thinking of that those 900 tags and that was that was in oil disclose the category of the space but there's aisles so how do you how do you get the tags from a database to have them actually end up in the appropriate aisle so I can then place the tags in the right place within the aisle sure I'll show you an example yeah that would be great that's not of the it's not actually a supermarket that I'm going to show we have one under development at the moment that does that but hopefully you'll get the feeling from from this shear so we're actually looking just in a vacated property at the moment that we were using as a bit of a tea speed and if you can't sleep at night you could always try counting metatags there's about 280 in these four aisles so what the powers of visualization I'll show you this model it's an indoor/outdoor scan that we've done and just zooming in on that space you can see what we've done here is we've created some room labels bulk and put one button for two three and four and we've dropped them where we want to start the row from so if this was a supermarket you have your aisles and products down either side of this then we create a CSV file that has the data this is just a me data and here at the moment with some images and things thrown in and loaded in and you choose the spacing so here we chose to import a certain number and that they should be spaced so far apart each with a certain stem length so the result is once it loads and we get to see it via the SDK before we commit us and then we say yes that's where we want it to be now we could have created these tags all through this build and we could have had some more over in this area had we wanted we just elected to drop them in these form places for this upload so excuse me so so each of those rows that again that might have been produce correct in this case were just showing dummy date data and an image but if I remind you of the earlier example we showed we actually had and detail you had the product information you had a link to the online store could all be pre-populated from the CSV phone so it really for the the matter port service provider working with their client to say you know hey can you give me your your your excel file your s CSV file so that it's organized you'll make it easier for all of us if you logically order the matter tags whether it's in by aisle for a store or by section of a store or however it is that they do their planning grid for it for that store the the the and I just I just have to think that they actually have some kind of organized way to even when they're in an aisle that there's this section of the aisle this section of the aisle this section of the aisle this section of the aisle and therefore it shouldn't be that hard to ask them to provide the data in that way correct and a few if you follow that thought process in this case we've done one import / row and the definition of a row has taken from the position of the of the room label tag that we've added these bulk import ones if you had an aisle going down the page and halfway down it went from flour to sugar to whatever they would all be created as room labels and we could just have the flower tag sitting next to that section so there's a piece of work to determine what tags need to be dropped where to get them close because once you're close of course then you can just jump in and click on each one and drag them to the products where they need to go literally we're we're in matter port workshop right now you've imported the tags you're doing an inspection you might you might decide to save and publish them save them save them and publish or you might say okay I'm now ready to start dragging the tags the matter tags to put them in the right place it's a point to that product courage so we're now looking at standard meta port functionality with all the tags just with default at the moment but if this here was the aisle of the products it's as simple now as to click on each one and just finding the right image to associate it to and then drop them where we need to drop them so that that is the manual piece of work that is still required is to do that final positioning but of course once I've done this I can then re export the data and now I have that coordinate stored so the next time we upload the data we don't repeat this process they'll already be in these positions we would put them but I think if I heard you correctly earlier we're really talking about a URL that's pointing to a shopping cart so we're not manually going into the model to change the prices of each produce within a tag manually you have home plan has actually automated the shopping cart or the say this your home plan has automated going from shopping cart to mater tag so that if there's dynamic pricing the pricing is changing within the Mater port space without somebody to have to go in and manually change the matter tax correct so to put it into three logical buckets this line you can see here is the data that's being imported and dropped ready for the customer our customer to drop it where it needs to go then once they do this and they drop it where they want it to go we export that and that becomes our new data set because that's where you want them to stay long term and the third layer is now the data within each one of these tags that is what can now be dynamically updated we just update the file and Riaan for them and these will have the new descriptions new prices new links new photos whatever it needs to be I'm confused I don't actually need to reinforce them to have the price change because the the link is actually pointing to a dynamic link in within the shopping cart without going too deep into it once we create a tag if this here happened to have a shopping cart URL and here as you can add using the standard functionality that is a static link the content that might point to it could be quite dynamic and could change over time if you want to just include the link then you would never need to change this tag again because it links the online store if you want the tag to include the price and a description and how many are available all that data changes over time so that would require us to re-upload that data and at the moment what we do is reinforce the tags fresh it has the same effect as if you were going in and updating the data because it puts them back in the same place again so I imagine if a company came to you in and said hey we want to do this at scale and we have things a change in price and we really do want to have the daily price check the prices change daily the inventory change daily while that piece might be a manual export/import I imagine if the project is big enough you'll figure out how to automate the process yes a few are going to a daily or even a real-time update there's other ways to do that using transient meta texts I would suggest a solution at the moment is best suited to weekly updates monthly updates less frequent so a good example that she came out I would being approached by furniture shop and that furniture shop has 300 items in there they don't change that often but they do sell them and then run out of them so they might do an update to that information once every three weeks or something like that and which case a manual process works just fine but it is absolutely possible what we're doing is unlocking now with I should say a manual process of works just fine that's using your automated tool to automate that manual process so what for 300 matter tags to change that out weekly for a matter port service provider thinking in a traditional manner that would be a nightmare but but using the the home plan automation tool for exporting and importing it's it makes it super easy super fast and affordable to do but there is still it presently a manual piece that you do in the background to facilitate that yeah what actually absolutely amazes me doing as we've been approached by different people about this service the the things they're asking me about I never would have thought you would use me report for and the fact that people are going to and museums exhibitions construction condition inspections it's very laborious the way they've done it they're trying to do exactly as we did they're trying to differentiate themselves use the tool to best effect and use that to get the most out of it and possibly promote their services over others so all I'm just amazed at all these applications that are appearing now what we've done so far think of it as a version one release of what we're doing we've unlocked it we know that we can load literally thousands of meta tags if the model could take it and do it in a way that would take a fraction of the time of a manual process there will be future iterations the ability to directly update tags the ability to have transient tags that you can update in real time all those things are possible and we might look at further on as new versions of what we do Scott you mentioned the app earlier in the in the property management the popular forgive me I didn't write it down the the app sorry the - icon no the the bf4 document documenting oh I ordered her and are you automating a process right now for how you get from my order I what it turn to a spreadsheet to upload to the matter port tor so we have built a automation of that process that currently has two manual steps still enough and once we are comfortable that those automated steps work we can then move to full automation from our auditor and to the meta portals great and and so as you keep coming across documentation tools then if the project warrants you'll you'll write the automation to help facilitate this so that it you keep reducing the number of steps reducing the amount of time to actually facilitate doing this on a weekly basis if that's what the client needs concur it what we've proven is that it's possible and we're our own this newscast because we are using I audited with automated steps and something that used to take us hours now takes us minutes so that encourages us to take what we've put out to market right now which is the tag import service and look at expanding that in future so others can enjoy the intend automation that we've managed to create for ourselves okay you mentioned earlier MPM bed M as in Mary P as in Paul MPM bed a overlay for matter port showcase that you had done something interesting and innovative with that particular third-party tool which turns out to be very popular among that we get around Network forum community can you describe and a little maybe a little deeper dive when when and how you use M p.m. bed absolute me to jump quickly into a model again to be sure that yeah yeah that'd be awesome I've got two examples I'll jump first there Ken to the one we were already looking at the web Street property we wouldn't be without him that makes all this possible again those who are familiar with meta tags and meta ports know that there isn't a great deal you can do with them apart from into the data and then drop them around we have over the site here this is from the NPM bead tall a couple of cool tools we've got that that Chris provides us through Indian beard we can just channel them things off yes excuse me you mentioned Chris so that's a MPM bad developer Chris Hickman yes so he has this ability to be able to switch tags on and off which we love because it does clutter up the screen a lot has other facility that is good and this use case is the ability to take a snapshot of a screen allowing that within the front end rather than having to be a workshop user to do so but the real benefit comes up here this is MP and bead functionality you're looking at here where you can create filters automatically based on color so we can just jump to all the issues in this case which are red and be taken straight to that particular tag or we can search and I don't know what to search for that we'll try curtain or something and it will jump you to the tags that have that particular word in it the final use that we have here is just the ability to group so here you can see that even though it's quite a small apartment it's quite a few tags and it's so our ability to have a very simple logical flow of the different tags by room so that you can look at these things as very valuable so could you show turning on and off different tags based on using MPM bed back panel on the left so using this panel on the left you can stitch for a particular item you can filter to get down to them and select the ones that you want and of course if you just want them all to disappear there's this button down in the corner which just makes everything go away okay so let's turn let's turn on all the tags for the moment matter tags okay and now you mentioned that red was a problem so maybe you could select red yes and I but I still see tags displayed so is it still going to display all the tags but I can see on the Left panel which ones are red concurrent so that this is a filtering of which of the tags meet the criteria that you're being Ted so you can then select theme it doesn't like the other ones disappear it just helps you navigate very quickly to the one that you're looking for ah okay so let's turn if you would let's turn them all on and then I see I see kitchen cutlery draw dirty so you click on that now it's highlighted that matter tag and it showed us a photo within within that tag showing that so that's a still photo that was taken with your app or automatically exported from the app imported into using home plan imported into the matter port workshop placed in the right place now using NPM bed you could go literally find that dirty where is that dirty drawer in in the matter port space correct wow this is kind of black blows me away I I imagine you know I think it's probably like what you described you you had a problem for specific clients you built this tool to solve the problem but now as you start rolling it out in the we get around Network forum community it sounds like you're starting to learn about other use cases that you hadn't even occurred to you yes correct it's awesome can we go back I just I really want to go back to MPN bed because it this this is a super powerful tool and you don't want to jump into the other sorry I interrupted you only jump in the other example then yes but not yet I just want to go back to to to the example you were showing us okay Scott that's fun you're the boss dang you're the man there we go okay so I because I really want to go slowly on this left panel so the different colors tell us within MPM be what these are called these are so the colors are what you can do in pea and bead well if I jump back a step when you're creating tags and meta port or throttle you're choosing a color that you want that the head of that meta tag to be well you can then do an MP and B there's an option to make a label to every color combination the sixteen ones that are available with a metaphor so we've simply told it that if it's a green tag and medical that means good or clean and impe and bead and then it allows us to the Dean crane grouping based on that color awesome and those those are they called labels or would you call it something else there's in terms of the yeah I can't remember the exact term that is anything before them but let's call them labels okay so we'll call labels and then you could put those labels in whatever order you wanted on that menu it sounds like you could have as many as sixteen of those labels because there's sixteen to fault matter port colors I assume so we tend to try and keep it down to a traffic light type system where we have good and a couple of other ones like exclusion week okay and then we're we're did the different room types come from so that is at this stage a manual and manual activity with an MP embed as you have the ability when you have this text window come up an MP embed you can create folders basically and within those folders you can then drop the tags and at the moment that has a manual process so presently there's a there's a there's a manual step in saying take all the take take the pins that are related to no because the bathroom would in the example you gave earlier the bathroom would be a row so you already have the matter tags assigned to bathroom you read current I'm sure that again in future versions there's no reason with a bit of collaboration between us and Chris pilots because we know that this tag belongs to a bathroom group it would just then be creating an interface to allow in given B to know and to accept that data but again this is not a big job once you have all these tags of gearing to create these set of folders it would take you about two minutes to drag and drop them into the right place okay great and then if we go right down to the bottom here we're showing just two other buttons from from NPM b1 button was related to turn on and off matter tags the other button right to the right of that was the the camera so if you needed a snapshot showing a particular place in the room and I'm gonna guess if you if you opened up a matter tag and you displayed that dirty drawer kitchen drawer then you could take a snapshot of the room with that matter tag of the dirty drawer open is that clear yeah the standard function there for that photograph would be for example when you see this big stretch on the wall would be to take a shot of that and export it as a standard image whether there's value in snapshotting the tag itself I don't know because we already have this as I saved image if you were trying to call attention to where the problem was and you wanted to you might take an overall picture in that matter tag might be open I think the point is that screen capture would capture the the matter tag open if that's what you chose to do I believe so I need to do some testing around it the problem we have in New Zealand is that the the judicial system doesn't work in 3d yet so that if you were having an argument about the condition of this property and whether this existed before after or they will accept this photos and printouts of photos to discuss it good news it's actually an illogical way that if you know you don't have to go scour to go find all your stuff it really is organized in a way that that makes it super easy I mean you know if that was a relational database that had 200 different line items you got to go it still I don't this just seemed I'm a visual person that just seems to be so much easier to look at this visually and decide what you know what what piece you me you had an Scott you had another example you wanted to show us before but again it's one of those use cases that people might not think think about on this kit until you put it in front of them so this year again I'm using the same WP 3d plug-in at the front end but this toy and this is a indoor/outdoor scan of a cemetery now this is a very historic building we have here and well in a small church the original scope when we first discussed it with them was purely to do a a 3d walkthrough of this church area but then we got to thinking and we pulled the blk 360 camera out and said hey why don't we do the entire the entire cemetery the entire graveyard and and let's not just scan it let's have the ability to have on every headstone details of who is buried there and a close-up photo of that particular headstone and then we thought well in addition to doing their in why not use indium bead and have the ability to search for a certain person and have it take you straight to that particular place in the cemetery Wow so this particular model draws together lots of things that sort of we do then are a bit different to how other people work so this is a full outdoor skin using a combination of the BLK 360 camera and the metaphor Pro 2 camera and then we have within it about 300 meta tags which of course links back to our import service these originally would have been dropped down these rows to be close to where they need to be positioned and then we've gone and manually dropped them in position to get their final excuse the pun resting points we're so is is this a pro-social project that we're looking at yeah we basically did this as much as anything for our own research and development in terms of a computer being a commercial type job and it's been met with a lot of positive feedback the ability to have virtual symmetries there's there's already search capability online but they don't give you this sort of first-person ability to as if you were the air war and visits the grave site of a relative which might be in another another country or another time yeah you know when I that's great thanks for showing us that example Scott you know I think one of the the great things about looking at that example first you mashed up so many different things matter port Pro to 3d camera like blk 360 camera obviously matter port matter tags the home plan importing of the matter tags that a project obviously would not have been possible to manually do the use of WP 3d models wordpress plugin and the use of Ranade fingers the the use of NPM bed and when you mashed up all those different solutions that you were able to create something that is super easy and to use I think it's a good example for for two reasons one not that it's necessarily something that you're gonna be making money with yes it's pro-social you you gifted this church something you know beautiful that that is meaningful to a lot of people and families to kind of bring that space to life but I think by doing those kinds of passion projects you discover you know problems and then all of a sudden you're able to solve a problem with with the tool but once you look at something like this I'm gonna suggest two things one is for our audience to look at that and say okay don't think about it as a cemetery think about it is where else are there spaces that need lots of documentation that simply wouldn't have been possible without the home plan automation of of exporting and importing matter text and that the second thing is I'm gonna say something I don't know if it's true or not and maybe it's too it's too soon but I imagine that when you do a pro-social project a passion project like documenting the church there are so many people that your project now touches from as they use that tool to go find their loved ones or to share with people that at some point somebody's gonna say wow I got a factory can you help me with that I got property that needs to be documented can you help me with that so I I think over time that this probably will generate inbound leads from people that look at it and have a use for it in business that reach out to you I may be reading in too much but I think that will happen well I think I think you're right just returning to the charitable approach if you can find one more finger there the the next potential step which we may or may not do for this project is to now put it into our paper paper view overlay that works within our paper view which means that you can now use it to raise funds ah so and that's an entire topic home plan pay per view and we're gonna have Scott hopefully Scott you'll come back and tell us about your new home plan pay-per-view solution yes I thought I'd mention it there because I think that the use of 3d tours and for charitable reasons is a missed opportunity with so many of us stuck at home and needing to spend more time at home while covert 19 as is haunting us this gives the opportunity for Emma species to go out and create 3d tours enrich them so that they are a real experience like this graveyard tour is and then add an overlay that allows them to monetize it which means those charitable organizations can begin raising funds I mean I don't know Dan but I'm guessing that anyone who's connected to that cemetery wouldn't mind paying a few dollars for the ability to walk its grounds and search search for their gravestones of their of their family members so I certainly think that there is I won't try and push pay-per-view in this discussion but it is a useful use case to think about but you're right all we're doing at the moment is throwing some use cases that you and I know about or can think about with so many meta port msps or users out there they're all using this in slightly different ways that we didn't imagine so all we're doing is putting this on the table and say hey if you were being held back by meta tags a manual creation process well we can help you with it yeah I see the the in two use cases one is these are these are pain points that I have today because I had to re-upload the model and I now need to move mattr tags from here to there and I really don't want to do that all over again or use cases that that without this automation simply are not practical either from the the pain and suffering of having to manually do so many mattr tags or the cost that one would need to charge a client in order to do it which sent me prohibitive so I think it's use cases that are that we have pain today that you solve but you also have use cases for opportunities that your tool now enables and I think that's really probably exciting for for and I think for both of us because I'm really curious of what are all the different use cases that may surface once someone realizes that this automation is possible we definitely know that sorry and we certainly know that we now have a an MSP who is working on scanning a small scale supermarket and with the intention of using it as a online store and because the nature of that is public you you'll get to see the result of that once that's been completed and we're actually and inviting and approaching others when we find a model online that has a hundred two hundred tags we're reaching out to those MSPs and saying hey that's really cool just so you know cuz i know how you created those tags if you need to get the data out again if you need to do it again or update them we're here we can help with that I so I I hope when that supermarket is a public space that you'll encourage the matter port service provider to publish so that we get around Network forum for those that are watching on YouTube or Vimeo or one of a dozen other places where our show shows up we get around Network forum comm we get around Network forum calm no hyphens just we get around Network forum calm or the short version wgan forum calm Scott we didn't talk about exporting excuse me exporting matter port labels do you have an example to show or can you talk about where when someone might want to export matter port labels sure so we have the ability to export labels and the primary use of that is actually to ensure that we get the right connection of imported tags to the right label I'm not aware though I'm sure other users of metal will correct me of a very strong case to have hundreds of labels in a model so it is something that we can do we can export them out but it's pretty much a supplement to the meta tag important and export process so an example might be let's say in that grocery store I might if example I might literally go through the grocery store and put Row 1 Row 2 Row 3 Row 4 Row 5 ro 6 that might be a label and and then I might have Row 1 a Row 1 B 1 row C 1 row D 1 row F and now I've created some what would you call that organization it's a process to say okay I have 20,000 square feet however many meters that is I'm about to go import 200 matter tags I want to be able to put the matter tags as close as possible to the pasta section to the water section to vary yogurt section so I'll go through the model the first time I'll go map it with labels and then I'll ask you to export all those labels so I don't have to handwrite them and now I have the labels to actually map to the matter tags in some form or fashion with within let's say Excel okay so anything else on matter port label export no I just maybe point to the on our website we've got a video there it's a takes you through the whole process showing you the actual back in that we use and that would help you understand a bit more as to we will use or the connection between labels and meditates Great Scott how about taking us to that page so that our viewers know where to find that video I've watched the video and I think it's a eight or nine minutes it's really excellent that it really gets into a little bit deeper dive of there it is so we're on the website home plan dot NZ h om e hom e PL n dot NZ what do you call that in in New Zealand what we recall is e is it the live show visit okay home plan dot in Zed for our New Zealand viewers and then up at the top it says global new and so that is where you clicked on that then you got down to matter port import for for tags and that's the page that we're on then we can see this video in the top right corner there that video kind of walks you through the process of downloading uploading and a little bit greater detail than we've showed today but the video so excellent I didn't think we actually needed to go through in that level of detail Scott how about scrolling down if you would let's take a look at pricing and walk us through pricing of home plan automation of exporting and importing of matter port matter tags absolutely you notice from the pricing that the server as designed for those working at scale so if you have only ten meta tags then it's probably works out cheaper more efficient just to do them yourself what we're dealing with models that have 50 hundred hundreds of tags and so the pricing structure that we've got here is a few have a model that has the tags in it you've manually created them previously and you want to export them out into a CSV format we can do that for you for a one-off charge of twenty US dollars if you move over to the next service which is to import we will export them for free it's a part of the mix service along and for us to important tags that works out to be 50 cents per tag starting at a minimum of $150 as the minimum charge there now that those prices assume that there is data that's really and we're working with others now for example sometimes it takes a few additional steps to prepare the data and we're happy to help out with that as well ultimately here we are we're here to help we're with we're medical geeks and I I think I mentioned what I've been blown away all of the applications of medical that have come through advertising this service our pay-per-view service I never dreamed how wide it could be used so we're really keen to make connections and for anyone who wants to use this type of service on golding or make it work we'll make a cost of it terrific um take me to one level of detail that do I have to transfer my model to home plan to actually have this process work yes we've got some constraints based on the meta port API and there are some enhancements coming to that API later this year which will help in today's world for us to be able to import tags into the model the easiest way is that that model is transferred to our account we then run the run the scripts updated and then transfer it back to the customer awesome Scot is there anything what questions should I ask you that I haven't asked about on plan automation of matter port matter tags Dan I think you the most thorough interviewer I've ever had to deal with so well done I think you've thoroughly covered the topic and made me think about a few things along the way what I would suggest is there will always be people who ask how exactly does it work and look to the video in the first instance but I'm happy to jump on zoom' meetings with other customers if they want to understand it better understand their applications and and of course we we like to give it a go if we're not sure it's the right application or then let us know what the model is I mentioned before the meta port API and that models need to be transferred to us to to upload them we actually don't need the model transferred to us to export from them so we can actually do a bit of a proof-of-concept on people's models with it still sitting in their account to show them what the data looks like and how it works okay very cool this is very exciting to see how you've taken the matter Ford API SDK and added a huge value to the to the matter port ecosystem so super exciting Scott before before we say buy anything else you want to cover talk about I want to say first of all thank you Dan for spending a the best part of a an hour and a half talking to us about this it's been great our our desire to move our service globally was brought about five covered 19 being in lockdown normal day job if you like as scanning properties we have four Pro two cameras we have a be okay we have a Zed one but we will be building our own automation tools for our own purposes and when we always to lock down that was our opportunity to take what we had known and allow others leverage it as well so the meta tag import/export that's been about six months and development and we're glad to now have a launched we touched on before the pay-per-view that again we we believe is a a useful feature and the world going forward the ability to to charge an entry fee on a metaphor model that's been enriched to make it a good experience be it for charitable fundraising or for exhibitions and the like and then we've got the the big the big one coming along soon as well which I'm happy to share just a couple of details of we've got a service coming called open archive there's been a relatively high amount of heartache up there about data ports changed last year from classic pricing to the more active pricing and the fact that it can be ten times more expensive we we have approval for medical for what we're doing and we're developing a similar front into our pay-per-view that allows a customer to have an active or archived models setting and and we're able to grant access to them to make them active for a very limited amount of time and then close them down again and what that means is if you have a thousand medical models that all need to be active maybe for insurance but the occasional use rather than that requiring a license that has to have 1,000 active models available to it you could probably do it with 50 active models so it's a really exciting product it's the one we've been actually working on the longest it's there to help us because we're in the same boat as everyone else and just look out for it we'll have some more details coming out in the next month or two awesome can we get you back do you had a separate show just on that topic as well absolutely that we think that's probably gonna be the a service that's going to appeal to a lot of any space so you know it interesting here you talked about Co vid 19 the coronavirus you know obviously that's affected all of us in different ways for you in New Zealand that man if I heard correctly five cameras total just over six six overnight stopped scanning and certainly that can be probably somewhat you know frightening for a small business at least I think something really good has happened as a result of that in terms of the tools that you originally put together for your company you've now accelerated that the development and launch of these tools to now make them available worldwide and so I I think that piece is super exciting we're happy to share that message with our community I would add that and I think there's certainly two ways to get a hold of you if you go back to the home plan dot n Z home home page there's a contact us a button in the top right you can get ahold of Scott but Scott is also a member that we get around Network forum community its home plan in Z at home plan n Z certainly start a discussion in the forum Scott be happy to just bend and answer your questions there Scott thanks for being my guest on the show today thank you for having us we've been visiting with Scott Mackenzie's the Mackenzies the director of home plan based in Lower Hutt New Zealand a matter port service provider like the rest of us but I would say probably when steroids given that you have automated exporting and importing of matter for tags the exporting of matter port labels your pay-per-view that you'll be back to talk about and yet a bigger piece that you'll be back to talk about as well so for Scott in New Zealand and myself dance make Brad founder of the we get around Network forum in Atlanta you've been watching wgan TV live at five
