 we are testing the most extreme viral take on my packs do they work or do they not work go first tick tock let's go I don't understand what are they using oh it's foil they're using foil they set off their school alarm I think okay so it looks like this applies to need you just need gum wrapper and then you just need a I think you can use a triple-a or a double a either way and then I'm being handed a pencil so I'm assuming I need this for something should we have water or something yeah let's get some water oh by the way don't try these tick tock Y packs at home okay I will tell you this though this life hack works Maddie has to go buy a hundred dollars with the press in Salzburg okay that's fine oh why can't she just agreed to it make sure you guys use the foil side so this is the inside of the gum wrapper you don't use that I think it's just like regular paper material the outside is what we're trying to use so how we're gonna put this down to get the minus on it and you're gonna want the positive side of the battery on the top this is dangerous Oh Oh what already started smoking it already started smoking wait a second Oh oh my god but so cool I can't believe this is actually working if they all work I will literally go out and jump in the cold plunge pool naked if you ever look your keys in the car here's a way to get it unlocked and all you need is a tennis ball so there's no way in impressive because the chances of this one working is like the equivalent of like Cal's writing for this guy Matty there's no way like you're not gonna cut a hole in a tennis ball and then the shirt gets it open Betty but we're not like in space how much air pressure can a tennis ball really create to change or unlock a mechanical lock the first one was cool it actually worked the chances of this one working slim to none but you know what regardless of that ladies and gentlemen I'll take this moment if it does or does not work to take your device you're watching this video on turning like this make that red subscribe button grey alright so if we want to really test this Maddie you should let me lock your keys in the car. No! Preston, no no. Do you have spare keys? No! How am I ever supposed to get take talk famous come on Maddy no well just lucky I'll go get high and get you an uber yes it's perfectly safe look at his with a giant open parking lot that's a hard caste fine all right so I don't know like all he did in the video he cut like just cut a small hole in the tennis I think that's safe we think you should stab towards it but so like how many Preston's does it take to cut a tennis ball okay Johnny to make like an incision help get these sisters are tough enough okay we upgraded yeah we had to get a box cutter which is very dangerous by the way bro okay this tennis ball better give us the air pressure so now I think we have to cut like a circle right like in the video they had a circle cut in their tennis ball I don't know how they did that so well so use the box cutter make a hole in the tennis ball then use some scissors to kind of make the hole a little bit bigger oh yes she on the money buffaloes but whatever Miami Buffalo Miami Buffalo someone does not watch football but I watch anime that is almost identical to the tick tock we just watched the car is locked does it's not gonna work so don't get your hopes up so he puts it on here pumps it like twice do it again there isn't Maddie I could do this a hundred thousand times do it and this won't work I'm literally rocking the car this woman I think this one's a myth guys this week I know she just did Maddie I saw that that's a myth this one has been busted Bree what are you watching the Jonas Brothers just made a new tech dog and that was hilarious oh my gosh I love them I actually found a life hack on tik-tok that I think you should try oh I need all the hacks of life what what is it it's how to solve a Rubik's Cube but oh I think I can impress my husband without lying down he's literally just going up and down and everything's changing well that's easy enough why didn't my mom tell me that's an elementary school I would have been the coolest kid in class do I have a Rubik's Cube do you just carry this in your purse I already mixed it up for you is it up up down I think it's up down why are you facing away from me trying to show you the Rubik's Cube it's the most important part up I don't know why he was calling this up because it's going to the side down unless I'm doing it wrong no I think that's right hey any moment now up down there's more bread there's more bread up down you're a lot slower than he huh down am I doing this right up down up yeah Mattia don't like your life hack hey guys president Bree are having an insanely good time with these life hacks and I don't want to figure out a good one that I can use - let's see what life pack is show you guys how to get out at times in 60 seconds if pressing - Briana - I don't know if you're gonna have enough time to do all this pull it through here we go see it's through the other side so I tied my shoelaces together off-camera because I want to save some time ready guys I need to get my hands if tied right now who's gonna zip timing it all right finally Nick got me zip tied let's go see if we can get this how do you he also have to be flexible for this life hack let's test your shoelace just your fine nose I gotta get the lace around Nick how do I get the lace oh what's not gonna help but my laces aren't as long as the dude in the video I only have like three-inch laces you can see that close up there I almost have the lace all the way through use the wrist there we go this guy's way more flexible than me how in the world I have to bite that lace I know I got to get my teeth down there hops are cramping monkey life and death kidnapping situation you need to flex yourself out of this I'm not flexible enough think I don't know but I feel like whoever kidnapped you would have noticed you doing this by now no they're probably out grabbing lunch or something what if the kidnappers just left your shoelaces tied like this like what if hypothetically the kidnappers tied your shoelaces the way that the guy in the video did not knowing this life hack would let you out you're saying what if my kidnappers were stupid oh my gosh my kidnappers left my laces tied around my zip-tied that works so easy that was so incredibly easy if your kidnappers leave your life this is it time for your zip tie you gettin out no problem Nikki are you feeling okay you're not in

buy stuff from oily B I mean can't shoes I have more than one love in my life one is pizza hoodies and one is really be merch there's two things that I love tick tock life hacks I've always been testing those today and I think I deserve a chance to test them so look I found this on salt absorbs glue oh I didn't know that hey he's putting a lot of glue into that and there's the salt okay Madi in it right it was right on no that's just gone the glue just disappears I think you need to try that okay you just you just have yes Matty I have it okay relax your roll there's no one else think that's a little strange this is important stuff how would I do this trick talk if I didn't have this stuff and I'm always prepared so you're struggling a little what is this childproof oh it's the other side the other side so now you have to put glue in there first the smart Maddie this is why I have you here okay so he did a lot of glue so I'm gonna do a lot of glue as well yep keep going hey even more than that I mean this looks like pretty okay yeah that's as much as the glues I really hope the salt absorbs it cuz it's starting to get real cold okay moment of truth just there we go this is oh you're making a mess just it kind of worked no it did Matt it didn't work at all no my hands are just covered in Brussels oh you this life hack no no one that gave it to you because this is a terrible time I'm just gonna leave you clean that up I'm gonna go are you gonna eat guys life hack busted uh-oh we're watching another tick tock and I don't know who this girl is but she's she's got the favorite Alan Red Solo cups okay so she's unwinding an entire this is so wasteful it's an entire roll of paper towel dude this is too much what no it's not it's just enough this is a one minute tick-tock wait you can make a speaker with a roll of paper towels and two Red Solo cups no hold on okay and let me see if this works if this works I've got a bone to pick with this one we will not be wasting all of this beautiful paper towel we just need the roll at the end okay so now that we've got the roll what you want to do is you want to make an incision right here in the middle there we go yeah I gotta make okay so once you have the incision made for the size of your cellular device then we have to make two more incisions on these plastic cups oh my gosh this is actually plastic cups are not be easiest to make cuts in one more incision on the cup over here so now you got to squeeze the tube inside the plastic cup where you made the incision there is no way this works what are we gonna play now with our amplified speakers I'm not gonna play one of my own videos because that would be too cliche so I'm gonna play one of the videos from this very humble handsome man named Preston plays no affiliation alright hold on the phone is going into this oh no do not make a deep incision push like a reverse pregnant woman right now oh it's in this is the most Scott thing I have ever seen in my entire life okay here we go three two and one it works really well can you guys hear that it's actually so loud it kind of actually really work I can't believe this word that does work the Sheep is attack today oh but it's trash Bri what do you have going on here I have found an amazing tick tock because when I was in cheerleading we have like days where you'd randomly give football players a lot of watermelon now what I mean thinking about it that's kind of I've never heard of that ever in my life but I would love to learn how to cut a watermelon more efficiently you know I'm really bad with my knife skills well here let me show it to you okay oh it kind of looks gross at the same time I don't really know that I like it being cut that way I'm gonna just be honest I have absolutely no knife skills and this is making me tear up my skills does it take out numchuck skills let's take an expert to cut a watermelon apparently it does watermelons even in season this time of year no it was very hard to find this one but where is it from did you ship it in from night cards you crew the one I didn't teach me okay so we now have an empty Pringles can just like the tick-tock

totally gonna come out success that sounds like success okay you got a really good clean cut in there well apparently this hack is busted we do have a large hole in the watermelon but Mady if you don't help me clean up after this you know what's gonna happen nope free I make it alright guys since the last hack works only if you're extremely flexible which I'm not I got a second chance so
