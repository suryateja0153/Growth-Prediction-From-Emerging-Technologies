 hey steve sweatpants hey marie from bnh how's it going all right not too bad you know a little drizzly but it's all good i heard you were on your stoop hanging out so i wanted to ask you 21 questions yeah talk to me they got me so tell me who you are and where are we uh i'm steve sweatpants also known as my real name is steven irby my mom gave you that name because i used to be lazy and never like to like do any kind of chores but i like to be comfortable and there's like a way of life so steve sweatpants is like me being comfortable with everybody and also being comfortable with my work i'm born and raised from new york i'm currently in bed-stuy been out here for like 12-13 years and like this is easily my favorite place about you know my favorite place about new york awesome so what do you do for a living i am a photographer i'm also a director and i run a magazine in a creative agency called street dreams magazine so um i'll be doing a bunch of stuff all day cool and times have been a little crazy these days how have you pivoted your photography and your business no it's been insane actually this has definitely been the craziest year of my life i think for all of us honestly um but i've always really prided myself on adjusting um i've worked a bunch of different jobs my whole life i worked as a custodian i worked at gamestop i worked as an electrician's helper you know pretty much everything under the sun so this is what i actually want to do and i love to do so i just just changed the cadence of my work to find things that connected more with my life and my love and i was been able to really you know appreciate the benefits from that because i'm enabled to be more honest with my work and write my own kind of pain in a way and communicate it so it's been working out really dope for me cool and so what's your go-to camera and lens my go-to camera and lens is my sony a7r iii um and my 85 1.4 but i do like to shoot a lot of street stuff so um right now i'm using my contacts t2 and this is my baby i love using this bad boy oh we're gonna walk actually and take a little dip cool see the neighborhood oh i'm old my back so what got you started in photography man uh yeah i'm a college dropout so i never really uh thought i was going to be doing anything with photography more or less um when i first started off i was about like 20 25 years old actually uh i used to really just love playing video games and i love watching films and like directing and loved watching like these directed films and stuff and i wanted to figure out how i could be a part of it and how could i you know document something like on my own terms and i didn't want to be electrician like my dad and because it was really just hard work so i tried to figure out like the good medium for it and photography was that for me so i could use my hands on my pops but at the same time i can create on my own terms and what drew you to portraits and street photography ah that's a good question hey what's up boss uh what drew me to portraits and street photography in the first place was uh is real it's intimate you know uh something about uh you know just something about portraits i think van gogh said it i'm not to get all deep and stuff but like you can actually see the emotions and you could get a real sense of time and i'm definitely paraphrasing what he said but i feel the same way about photos you know i'd rather take photos of people and you know the expression sometimes because i can actually dictate with and see what's going on um during that specific time period so portrait photography is important like people are important so you know i love taking photos of buildings and landscapes but at the end of the day people are the ones that are way more of a like a short-term kind of thing so i'm just with the people are there any photographers that inspired you always listen to this real quick uh i'm sorry um my favorite photographer that inspires me oh man that's a bunch honestly this is like i look at it as like contemporary photographers and you know like the old school like the legends and i've been citing more with the old school photographers as of late because they have way more like long-form work so um my favorite photographer right now is joseph rodriguez and jamel shabazz uh joseph rodriguez is probably the coldest photographer of all time in new york city uh he's been documenting new york from the 70s and 80s and he's documented l.a eastside stories like he's he's lived the craziest life he's also documented some of the most important things and um that's like he's like my ultimate mentor so i'm trying to be like you know i'm trying to be like him uh with my work and also jamel shabazz i could you know speak about jamal for you know forever but one of the things i love about jamel that like you know he's fighting for love in his work and and the representation of our you know of our community especially me being born and raised from new york so you know i take all that stuff really seriously and and jamelle and joseph is those are like the upper echelon of like people that i really aspire to be and can you tell me a little bit about street dreams magazine yeah hell yeah so street dreams magazine street jeans magazine is my baby um street dreams magazine we uh conceived this child about six or seven years ago now um the reason why i started actually is because of my barbers so shout outs to aj my filipino barber from staten island um whose father actually passed away from kovit which is actually some um you know it just shows you how crazy this year has been but if it wasn't for aj i wasn't linked up with eric and eric's from vancouver and eric and mike both of my fellow co-founders out there they came up with this idea for street dreams as a tumblr page that they've been using um but i've been linking with a bunch of people in new york and when i finally met eric through aj uh when we had the conversation about talking about street dreams actually walking over the williamsburg bridge um i told them it'd be really dope if we included you know all the homies and all the other people that i've been shooting with and learning with like the jay and silvas of the world uh wrong rob was a really uh rob mccarthy was a really big photographer uh and you know just a lot of incredible people in those first issues of the street dreams magazine issues that were really ground level people that we built this with so the whole point of street dreams i know it sounds a little long-winded but it's um the whole purpose of street dreams is you know waking up and doing what you love and creating a platform that we all could share that didn't have this weird pretentiousness to it so we can actually just share the work and see for what it was and without you know your social clout status um it was our big entire thing to the industry and now it's our baby so what's your goal for the future of street dreams magazine goal of street dreams magazine in the future um honestly i want to do everything uh it would be really dope if we can really start producing movies um and directing movies i really want to do that for street dreams we've also been working on a bunch of not-for-profits and starting up the street dreams not for profit so we can actually be involved in our community and setting up curriculums and uh just amplifying and making everything more uh with the cadence of some worldwide global things that we've been doing for the last six seven years but uh it's kind of getting crazy out here you ready to go like this i need to get out of here all right cool so now we finally got back inside it was crazy out there it was raining way harder than we expected but um what are your other questions maria so what other projects are you working on uh other projects that we're working on right now is actually issue 16 of street dreams we released issue 15 with joseph rodriguez and jamel last year in tokyo which was an incredible experience and uh since this year has been so heavy especially as a black photographer and a black director um i think is um is our obligation honestly to have this issue talk about a lot of the issue of the magazine talk about a lot of the issues in the world honestly especially when it comes to the black lives matter movement and um just you know the whole police brutality and the excessive force and you know all the things that are going on with that as well too in our unsure political climate there's a lot of things that we need to address but photography and art that you know issue 16 is going to be a really big deal for us to really put a lot of these issues into the uh the forefront with art um because i feel like you know with art this is something that we can actually you know control and have something a real voice into it so especially as a black photographer um this is everything for me this issue um coming up um besides that we are working on a couple of other books as well too i'm dropping my first book called how you holding up um it's going to be a three-part series that's you know talking that's gonna have a lot to do with everything that's going on with the world as well too from the coronavirus to the protest to um a lot of our perspectives as human beings in this world uh right now so i think this is the time to like for us like street dreams and myself personally to you know not only build our digital real estate and because we just dropped our website that we've been really hyped for and we added way more features to our website but also to do way more tangible things in the world as well too so we could live in both you know both sides of everything cool and i know you've done different photo labs and educational things why is education so important to you education is so important to me because it's about access um and the biggest thing for me uh when i first started off with photography is meeting other photographers that were willing to talk to you that were willing to communicate and not act like this is a competition all the time um if anything this is a platform where all of us can thrive and i really want to see people with the most honest and truest perspectives um if you're gay if you're black if you're asian if you're spanish if you're a poor white person like whatever it is i really think those uh perspectives and those stories are important so through online education and through all these different kind of teaching tools um i'm just trying to be as honest as i can about my experiences so that it could actually help benefit someone so you know if i were to die tomorrow nobody can say that i wasn't trying to help people out um i think it's really crucial to the experience to not try to keep everything to yourself and to share as much as possible i love that and social media has become a new business tool how has it helped you social media as a business tool is actually insane and um it's one of the most important things to remember it is a tool um it's so easy to get caught up in you know just the wide array of things that are going on on the internet but i feel it's so crucial to find um what do you want out of the app and not with the advocates out of you and i try to find i look at my instagram like a rolodex like a og rolodex and i'm going through the different photographers and and different photos and different art pieces and i'm just storing all the ill stuff my grandma always says bad association spoils useful habits so i take that same cadence when i use like my apps and all that stuff so um yeah because if you go on twitter for more than 20 minutes you'll be depressed sometimes so like i i i definitely stay very aware of that as possible and is there a specific photo or project that really helped you get noticed in the industry um recently a lot of the work that i've done during the protest has gotten me a lot of uh a lot of recognition that i'd that i didn't think that would be getting in the first place um i am aware that i do have somewhat of a social media following but i'm also really not into the numbers game and i really am concerned with the work that i'm producing and the and the substance of it so uh when it came when the protests and the the biggest civil rights movement in the history started happening i needed to make sure that not only i could represent my family and my you know the thoughts of my mother the thoughts of my father the thoughts of my sister but also like the thoughts of myself so when i created the work during the protest and i tried to take the angle of empowering people rather than just show like exploitive situations it was crazy to see how much people gravitated towards the work um and then i was been able to work with you know clients like gq and the new yorker and um and then list goes on and on honestly and all those opportunities that you know are you know rose from those occasions is because of me stepping outside and really trying to do my thing but on my own terms and i'm really appreciative of that so you have a pretty unique style and on your different pages and social media i've noticed lately on instagram you've been very monochromatic lately why has this style interested you um black and white has been a very uh a strong cadence with me uh for a couple of reasons one of the reasons is i'm i think there's art and consistency and black and white photographers have the such a strong consistency to their work that i just really admire that i wanted to do something that was a bit more controlled with my work but at the same time gave it a cohesiveness so that was the first part of it and then honestly with the deaths of nipsy hustle and kobe bryant and being a black person in general i felt that not only that the marathon continues but that i have a mamba mentality with my work and i really want to keep that that same cadence with it as long as i can um those two those are the two of the coldest brothers of all time to me and i really really influential and really empowering black people and it's just sad to see them go and but at the same time i could definitely honor them in my own way by doing something like that as well too so um it has a little bit of that to do with my black and white work so switching up a little bit what are some tips for someone looking to start a creative and artistic career like you i think the biggest thing to start a career in the arts is have like a really having like these senses of self-discovery that you can actually go through and figure out what you want to achieve with your work and what you're going to document i tell everyone every single time that if you consistently do anything there is going to be an art to it so like say if you were just taking photos of a bunch of different apples and oranges over time it's going to actually look kind of sick so if you understand what you're trying to communicate whether it is from food to people to places i feel that you it has to come from a unique perspective and as long as it's unique and honest it will translate 100 100 because we live in a day and age where everybody's smart and you can't just fake the funk with a lot of people you have to come from a place of purity wherever place it is and and i think art is a perfect place to do that um and you shouldn't take it for granted so if you could use one lens forever which would it be damn one lens forever honestly uh sorry oliver i definitely should have returned this lens a long time ago but it's definitely that 70 to 200. that's 70 to 200 even though i love the 85 1.4 and i love the g master series in general because i'm usually a prime guy the 70 to 200 just is the all-purpose it does everything i can take photos of your nostril hairs from anywhere that i'm at pretty much and i find that especially in street photography sorry there's a crazy there's always some crazy sanitation trucks passing in the hood um but i find like with the 7200 with the street photography it's not like the lens you probably would think to use um on your everyday basis but for me it's i love the challenge and at the same time i get a level of intimacy uh that's not not to say that you can't get it with other lenses but that lens is just really cold when it comes to that and um yeah i'm sorry guys i need to send you that lens today what has been the most interesting shoot you've ever been on man and the most interesting shoot i've ever been on that's a good question i think the most interesting shoot i've ever been on is this activation i've done for cartier uh three two three years ago um cartier flew me out to san francisco um and working with cartier in the first place is crazy because i'm a street photographer and i'm like i can't believe they'd be reaching out to work with me but at the same time um they actually that whole experience they it showed me that luxury wasn't just a metric luxury was an understanding a luxury was a like a cohesiveness if you will and what has been the most challenging shoot you've been on um the most challenging shoot i've been on oh man honestly they all have their own kind of level of challenge to them uh but i guess the most challenging shoot i've been on is oh man that's a really good quote not to sound not to sound conceited a cocky anyway but i maybe it's because i play a lot of video games i really accept all challenges if the difficulty is on the hardest i'm gonna be hyped for that so there's nothing that really defers me ever as a challenge there might be things that there might be a lot of things happening in the day but i bring all of it on i'm the person that runs straight towards the fire so i really don't see it as a challenge honestly and if you weren't a photographer what would you be if i wasn't a photographer what would i be i would definitely probably i would definitely be working in video games already by this time if i wouldn't be i wouldn't be a game developer but i would be like on some corey ball log like making god of war kind of thing i would i would probably be making like the next hood of the mix the next like hood god of war game or something like that um it's either video game development or i would have probably just been in music um i'm being a r or something like that for music because i love hip hop i love jazz i love classical um and i've i love trying to figure out ways to incorporate music in my life and so if it's not video games it would have been music because those are pretty much the only other things i like what's the best piece of advice you've ever received oh i will say it to my grave the best piece of advice i've ever received is from my dad my dad told me don't live to pay your rent and to me don't live to pay your rent means like don't uh spend your life doing temporary things um and that's why i take the cadence of my work so serious because i'm trying to do something that lasts a lifetime every single time tough question if there were to be a movie about your life who would play you ah if there was a movie about my life who would i want to play it it would have to be somebody dope you know i mean it can't it can't be i'm not gonna throw anybody under the bus um it would it would have to be maybe not the same skin color but it's still it's still count it has to be idris elba like idris elba has to be steve sweatpants it just played my life it was that's the only person if it's not idris like don't don't even hit me up so idris hit me up and last question who should we interview next uh i think you guys should interview either jerem cohen because jeremy's hilarious and he's probably having the best year out of any photographer that i've known or one of my really good friends and i always make fun of him rahim simon aka black soap he's one of the one my best friend to the core uh love that guy like a brother but don't tell him that um he's an incredible photographer as well too so he definitely deserves uh his time to tell a story awesome and that's all i got thank you so much for answering all my questions not that wet either that's not bad but not that bad all right thanks bye [Music] peace
