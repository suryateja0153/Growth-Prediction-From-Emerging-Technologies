 Hello to everyone joining us today for the live stream event or watching the recording later, and for those of you who've watched some of my earlier bIOTAsphere videos you know how passionate I am about DLT's in general and IOTA in particular. So today, building on my popular "100 Billion Reasons Why" video, I thought I'd up the ante with "600 Billion Reasons Why", because, it never hurts to have an extra 500 Billion Reasons to believe in a better future. So, a couple of years ago I was enjoying my morning venté Vanilla Latte in the neighbourhood coffee shop where they had a round recycling bin near the back of the store with three openings; one for paper cups without the lids, one for cans, glass, and plastic, and the last one was for other paper; though newer versions replace this with an opening for compost. Perhaps you've seen them. Customers were clearly being invited to participate in the recycling process. After all, the cup I was holding was made of paper, and the lid on top was white plastic with those three, well-known arrows. The cardboard sleeve also had a recycling logo, clearly printed on the side. It all made sense until I looked more closely. There were three openings in the lid of the bin, but there was only one plastic bag inside. The recycling initiative was an illusion. So, I asked to speak to the manager and she confided in me that at their location the property manager did not provide any recycling options, and in fact all of the cups were thrown in the garbage and ended up in landfill. And that got me thinking about a problem that I've seen reproduced from Toronto to Tokyo from New York to New South Wales. Single-use, hot and cold beverage cups made from high-quality long fiber paper that are tossed away by the billions typically within 15 minutes of being sold with a latte, a London Fog or a soda fountain Cola drink. It's a problem of epic proportions and it's emblematic of how we need to change consumer behaviour, and shift responsibility for cleaning up the mess we are all collectively making. I've spent much of the last year researching this industry, looking for answers to what appears on the surface to be an easy problem to solve, but in reality it's a complex ecosystem problem that involves many different players as we'll see in a moment. But this project is tailor-made for a permissionless decentralized DLT that supports feeless micro payments and data transfers. The market potential is simply massive but before we can talk about Distributed Ledgers we have to understand the core business issues that perpetuate the problem and prevent existing technology from addressing it. As Greta Thunberg has so eloquently pointed out, to the discomfort of many politicians and business leaders, we can no longer save the planet by playing by the old rules. This is a problem that requires changes in existing infrastructure, but also at the individual, municipal, commercial, and industrial levels. Because you can't have one without the other. So, while we're having conversations with many of the major players in this space we still have a long way to go. We are however, making steady progress to be the force for the change we'd all like to see in the world. So, what's the deal with single-use paper cups? Well, to start with, most paper cups are coated with a thin plastic lining that prevents the contents from leaking out onto your lap. In the case of cold drink cups, they're double coated with a plastic film on the outside too, to stop the paper getting wet from condensation. This makes them difficult to recycle, but the technology to do it already exists; it just doesn't get used that much. For example in the UK they have the technical capacity to recycle every single cup that's produced, but this capacity is rarely used. Here in North America, we have capacity - it just doesn't make financial sense to use it for cups most of the time. Now I'm sure you've heard of advances in compostable cups and biodegradable cups but just like the recycling bins in my story earlier, the fact that a cup is technically recyclable or compostable has very little to do whether it still ultimately ends up in landfill. There are currently many impediments to an item being properly recycled and they can vary from one city block to the next. Reusable and Returnable cups sound good on the surface, but they too come with a host of different issues. For one, the energy cost to produce, clean, and reprocess a reusable cup, often exceeds the carbon footprint of the new single-use paper cups it replaces, and all of the major retailers prohibited the use of reusables when the COVID crisis hit, so reusables are, quite literally, "off the table" for the near future. One thing is clear, any solution to this problem will require greater focus on Extended Producer Responsibility, so that those who produce these waste items pay to clean up the mess. But we also need viable and profitable markets for cup fibre, because without reliable demand for used cup stock it simply makes more economic sense to dump this material in landfill and that hurts all of us. Our solution inverts existing logic by focusing first on the far end of the cup lifecycle, and in the process, we create an incredibly lucrative market in which everyone in the ecosystem wins. Distributed Ledger and Digital Currency make the entire solution possible, and of course IOTA makes it viable. So, perhaps it will help to get a sense of the size of the problem. 600 Billion single-use cups are manufactured every year, and while a hundred percent of them can technically be recycled over 99% of them end up in landfill. Let's just put that in perspective for a moment. It's about 6.6 million tons of cups each and every year. If you put them end- to-end, the pile would reach 50 million miles; Enough to circle the equator two thousand times, or reach to the moon and back a hundred times, or even  reach to Mars. Compress and compact them all you can and the huge pile would still stretch two and a half miles from the United States Capitol building along the National Mall past the Smithsonian and the reflecting pool to the Lincoln Memorial. From the Washington Monument it would sweep up to and beyond the White House, past Pennsylvania Avenue and Lafayette Square to the steps of St. John's, The Church of The Presidents. Now imagine this vast area rising over a hundred feet tall, higher than the American flag that flies above the White House and you'll appreciate that this is a big problem... but it's one worth solving. Governments are looking to use mandatory cup charges sometimes known as latté levies To disincentivize consumers from using paper cups, but the fees won't change behaviour or get more cups recycled, though they might make your morning cup of java more expensive, and almost none of that money will go to reducing the number of cups that end up in landfill. I've shown some recent examples on this slide, but these programs are likely to fail in the long run because they do nothing to change consumer recycling behaviour. If you've ever stood in the line waiting to buy a coffee at a retail chain in the morning you already know that the increased cost will quickly become the new normal. nothing much else in the system will change so let's examine for a moment why cup recycling doesn't work today it's an ecosystem problem with multiple players but these players don't really work together and their economic incentives are not aligned from cup manufacturers to coffee shops waste collectors and waste aggregators to pulp and paper mills consumers to municipalities each has a different challenge it all starts with the cup today it actually costs more to make cups with recycled fiber than it does to use new virgin fiber most retailers won't pay more for cups with recycled content as it hurts their bottom line it's that simple now technically you can make cups with 40% or more recycled fiber in them without impacting their structural integrity but none of the big chains would buy them so instead we keep cutting down trees we won't see more recycled content in cups unless we can find ways to make them cheaper than cups made with virgin fiber money sadly talks for the retailer cups are simply a cost of doing business so unless being eco-friendly is part of their brand image they will always buy the cheapest cups available Starbucks uses 10 percent post-consumer recycled fiber in their cups but they're the exception rather than the rule but even when the cups are collected within the store if that store is in a shopping mall or office building their garbage collection on waste removal is typically handled by their property manager so the disposal is often someone else's problem then we have the consumer Hey that's me with my large vanilla latte now 80% of cups are taken to go and that number is only going to rise after kovat 19 so the burden of recycling the cup usually falls to the consumer and since cups are typically disposed of within 15 to 30 minutes of purchase the bulk of the problem has to be dealt with outside of the store where the drink was sold can your cup be recycled sometimes it seems like you need an environmental science degree to know the cup says it can be recycled but your municipality won't accept paper cups in their blue bin program the recycling bin in one shopping mall says it takes paper cups but another a block away says no cups but look inside any of those bins and you see something of everything there's garbage in the recycling bin recycling in the garbage bin is probably all destined for landfill because cross-contamination makes it all worth 'less we're confused we're lazy but mostly we're in a hurry so we dump everything in the nearest receptacle cup lid and the contents to the cold coffee dregs the banana peel perhaps the napkin and the muffin liner with the last bite of muffin maybe a piece of gum for good luck with no incentive or consistent recycling protocol cups almost always end up in landfill as they say in the UK minutes on the lips but a lifetime on the tips now cities are responsible for recycling in public spaces and they run the residential blue bin programs but cups are generally treated as garbage put single-use cups in those containers and the result may be that everything else in the bin ends up in landfill due to cross-contamination the truth is it cost more to separate the cups from the other materials in the bin then you can sell the resulting fiber for so it's cheaper to treat it like garbage and as if this weren't already bad enough cities across North America are abandoning their blue box programs because they're simply not sustainable no economic incentive two separate cups and cross-contamination reduces the value of the entire load so even when garbage collection and recycling is out sourced by the city to a third party or a property manager retains a waste management company to service their building 80% of what you think is being recycled often goes you guessed it to a landfill now all of this waste is generally collected and taken to a materials recycling facility known in the business as a MuRF or a waste aggregator where it's sorted and bailed these guys get paid by the ton but they can't make money separating cups from other materials because what they earn for the cup stock is less than the separation cost when cups are added to other paper bales it usually downgrades the value therefore most cups despite our best intentions end up in landfill since China and most other Asian countries stopped accepting containers filled with recycled materials from North America the price that the aggregators can earn for these materials has fallen significantly with no demand the price collapses and since only some pulp mills can process cups the cost of transporting bales of cup feedstock long distances means there's no money to be made for the small percentage of cups that do make it all the way to a pulp mill ready to be broken down and turned back into fiber there's a different problem how can they determine that the contents of a half ton bale of mixed paper or poly coat are what they say they are there's no audit trail and you can't tell what's on the inside just by looking at the outside of the Bale bails are sold based on weight but high moisture content from humidity or rain can significantly inflate bale weight and reduce yield so Mills must break the bales or invest in core sampling and core drilling technology to quality control what they're buying it's a messy and it's not a profitable one which makes investing in additional capacity unattractive after all if and even if you make a new cup stock with recycled fiber there's only limited demand from the cup manufacturers and so the whole system is really set up to fail the system is broken but if we can create value at the furthest end of the ecosystem the economic pullets created addresses all of the issues we've discussed today a ton of used poly coat fiber delivered to a pulp mill sells for between $30 and $40 a ton sometimes much less prices even went negative here in Ontario at the start of 2020 we asked pulp mills and aggregators what difference it would make to their business if we paid each of them a thousand dollars a ton to process paper cups as you can imagine their eyes widened and they told us it would be transformative creating a huge demand for cups upstream cups used for recycling would become highly valued collected separated and the resulting recycled paper output could be sold to cup manufacturers at much lower rates than today it sounds like an impossible aspirational dream but by turning the existing business model on its head we can change the economics of recycling for every player in the system now for the first time the ioaded distributed ledger can make the entire system financially viable by using unique QR codes and making each individual cup its own economic agent we can track its entire lifecycle on the ledger from manufacture to where it's sold to how its recycled and on its journey from birth to rebirth the data about its progress is recorded on the immutable Iota tangle creating unprecedented transparency and value for the downstream cups stock now the most obvious question is where will the money come from and who pays for this and that's easy it will come from a 25 cent deposit imposed on the beverage at the time of sale paid by the consumer and collected but not retained by the retailer a deposit that's assigned to the individual cup by a valued transfer to its digital twin iota address now we've already seen that governments have decided that 25 cents is just about the right value for a deposit and this amount is already built into the price of your drink bring your own refillable cup to most coffee shops and they'll reduce the price you pay anywhere from 10 cents to 25 cents today so this really isn't a big leap in the UK Starbucks offers the equivalent of a 31 sent us discount if you bring your own cup but less than 2% of consumers ever take advantage of the opportunity deposits on wine and beer bottles a commonplace and established consumer behavior in global markets in many US states and in British Columbia here in Canada deposits are already charged on plastic bottles glass bottles cans detergent bottles milk cartons cereal boxes and much more and recycling rates of 85 percent and higher a commonplace deposit and refund schemes are proven to be effective around the world in raising recycling rates significantly so none of this is rocket science or revolutionary but these existing systems have no way of tracking individual items they do little to reveal how much material actually gets recycled versus refunded and they create a significant audit challenge as money is collected in one place but refunded somewhere else for the first time iota makes this entire process efficient auditable fraud resistant and economically practical we will build an open public data Commons solution that will provide transparency to consumers and to government agencies about what's really happening with cups and we'll be able to track individual cups from one end of the ecosystem to the other this is only possible using digital twins uniq iota identities printed on each cup at the time of manufacture at almost zero marginal cost and these digital identities will be provided and issued by the biota sphere each digital ID will be used to record the life history of a cup and record the micro payments that fuel the system from end to end now let me introduce you to the cup crush unit it's a reverse vending machine that only accepts participating hot and cold single-use paper cups with a valid QR code and an active deposit the cup crush machine is a dedicated device that will be located where consumers are most likely to dispose of cups in retail Conchas transit hubs office tower lobbies and high-traffic street corners the unit will be largely touchless scanning the cup will initiate the refund and you'll be able to interact with the machine using a smartphone or just a physical piece of paper or plastic with little more than a QR code on it no personal ID will ever be required to guarantee your privacy in order to receive a refund the cup must be empty and uncontaminated so that the resulting cup stock is of the highest quality and no other materials are mixed with it remember the digital twin record knows the weight of the empty cup and the Machine can weigh the incoming item the final design is still to be determined but the important thing to understand here is that the machine will not only ingest cups and issue refunds will also get paid for the data it produces and for every cup it recycles so that owning cup crush units will be a highly profitable business with an ROI of seventy five to a hundred percent in the first year now of course technology is important but getting all of the players in this ecosystem on board is an assent your component for agreeing on standards and getting the buy-in that leads to large-scale adoption because without adoption even the best concept will fail enter Fisk the food industry sustainability consortium Fisk is a non-profit foundation representing all the players in the ecosystem from cup makers to pulp mills from municipalities to coffee shops from property managers and waste managers to the food packaging industry many of Fisk's members will be competitors outside of this context so it's important that any solution be 100% permissionless and open so even small players can participate on a level playing field even single location stores like a family restaurant will be able to buy coded cups from cup makers and a scanner and participate without having to ask permission or join a special members-only association Fisk's role is to drive adoption through marketing consumer education and public awareness campaigns and like every other player in this new ecosystem Fisk will receive a reward for every cup that gets recycled so that it is fully funded and its activities are paid for by the system it represents so now with Fisk at the center of our new circular economy let's see how the whole system works first the biota sphere will issue bulk quantities of iota based digital identities which are at the very heart of the system cup makers will request batches of these unique codes via API which they can subsequently use next the cup converter will print a unique QR code on each new cup they manufacture paper cups are already inkjet printed with batch codes during manufacturing today so the addition of a more sophisticated code does not materially change the manufacturing process or add cost to the cups as the cups are produced data is associated with each identity and is sent to the iota ledger information such as the size weight and construction of the cup as well as the materials used including the proportion of recycled content in the fiber manufacturer plant location date cup design and of the details are all recorded on the ledger at the retail location the cups are treated just as they are today they have no value until they're sold with the beverage to a consumer so there's no risk of creating a black market in unused cups consumers now enter the picture as beverages are sold the QR code is scanned and a 25 cent deposit is charged as part of the purchase price and optionally shown as a separate line item on the receipt now it's important to understand that the deposit is sent immediately and directly to the unique cup identity address and not held by the retailer this is the first significant difference between this solution and previous deposit schemes and it eliminates many of the audit and fraud issues associated with those programs now in the scanning process additional data is recorded against the transaction such as the retail chain the store ID and the geo code where the sale occurred plus the time stamp of the transaction etc now we don't want to know anything about the buyer or the product that they purchased we want to protect consumer privacy and the only thing we care about is tracking the cup of course we don't expect the retail store to perform this task for free collecting the deposit on behalf of the cup and transferring the value will be rewarded but that reward is only released when the cup is later ingested buy a cup crush machine notice on this slide that in addition to the pending $0.10 refund for the consumer both the retailer and the cup maker also have pending rewards shown in gray that will only be released the cup moves along its journey to the next stage in the process now at this point the consumer has their beverage in hand and some 15 to 30 minutes later their drink is consumed the embedded $0.10 refund can only be released by taking the cup to a cup crush unit if they throw the cup away they get nothing we'll assume at this point that the cup is scanned at a cup crush unit or authenticated and ingested and at this point several interesting things happen first the pending rewards for the cup manufacturer and the retailer are released back to them and you'll note how the gray items turn blue there we go both parties now have a vested interest in cups being recycled because they make money based on this beneficial act but because iota is completely felis there's no loss to middlemen secondly the consumer is rewarded with the $0.10 payment for their virtuous behavior their reward can be directed to a digital wallet or transferred as a credit for transit travel sent to a loyalty card or even directed to a charity you can imagine all kinds of cups for causes promotions where cups are seen as having significant value especially when multiplied over large populations consumers may even receive more than 10 cents if their action triggers additional rewards for example you might get a bat matching bonus of $0.10 towards your next coffee purchase if your reward is sent to your coffee loyalty card but even if a consumer thoughtlessly tosses their cup away anyone who collects it and returns it to a cup crush unit can claim the reward because the value goes to whomever recycles it again additional data is collected about the ingestion of the cup which is crushed and shredded by the machine and added to addition a digital twin QR coded bag we call a brick now bricks have their own unique digital ID just like the cups and each brick contains approximately 500 cups the machine has performed a valuable service and receives a pending 5 cent reward again shown here in gray in return for every carpet processes owning one of these machines will be extremely profitable with an expected seventy percent a hundred percent payback within a year so we expect property managers and municipalities will want to deploy the unit's wherever they can the machine can also collect other valid valuable data such as temperature humidity noise and air quality all of which will be added to the immutable ledger becoming part of the public data Commons the machine will also detect when it's nearing capacity and can advertise that fact over the network to collection agents so these collection agents will in their turn be rewarded for emptying the cup crush units they get paid 3 cents per cup or $15 per brick to empty the machine scan the brick ID and replace it with a new empty bag with a new brick ID just like all the other incentives the $15 per brick reward will not be paid until the brick is subsequently received and scanned by the waste and Agri Gator but you can see we're creating viable financial business opportunities for every player in the system just for doing the right thing and the collection agents in this model might be quite different from the people you expect just as an example post-office fans go out every morning full but often return to the depot empty perhaps the post office can participate in this economy assisting in the recycling process while generating revenue one can imagine an entire gig economy of people like rideshare drivers who might earn a living servicing these units in return for the rewards now collection agents will deliver the bricks to waste aggregators they can be scanned and the transaction recorded on the ledger the collection agents and again the cup crush machine receive their reward and the bricks are compacted strapped and added to half-ton bails containing fifty thousand cups each now each Bale has a unique Bale ID and it content contains details about each of the bricks it contains and therefore data on every cup in the Bale the aggregator will earn one cent per cup for this service but won't get paid until the bales reached the pulp mill remember that this 1 cent reward translates into $1,000 per ton for the aggregator and they didn't have to spend time resources or energy separating the cups from other materials because everything in the Bale is single stream uncontaminated cup stock in other words it's high quality fiber that's not only desirable it's extremely valuable but only when it arrives at a pulp mill so after transportation to the mill the half-ton bales are scanned there's no need to take core samples or break the bales apart to ensure quality and consistency after all every Bale comes with the full audit of every single cup it contains the mill knows about the weight construction and fiber content of every single one of those 50,000 constituent cups and they too receive one cent for every cup they recycle at $1,000 per ton you can be sure that they'll be actively searching for all the cup stock they can possibly find for this sort of money mills that don't currently have the technology to process cup stock will seriously consider making the required investments to compete in this lucrative market and the resulting supply should help drive down the cost of recycled fiber making cups that use recycled content cheaper and so the entire becomes self-sustaining finally when the bales are processed by the pope mill and the record is written to the iota ledger the pulp mill receives its payment and at the same time both Fisk and the biota sphere each receive a one cent reward for their part in the ecosystem and so the virtuous cycle begins and you it's all very elegant and addresses most of the issues around Cup recycling that exists today however no system is ever going to be 100% efficient so you might be wondering what happens to the cups that people still throw away it's a great question here again the beauty of the DLT solution an iota can provide the answer while many recycling programs around the world have achieved return rates and the high 80% and 90% range we assumed in the early stages that perhaps a conservative 20% of cups will be returned to a cup crush unit for the other 80% we know from the ledger the time stamp of when the deposit was collected and if the cup is not returned for a refund within 30 days a smart contract will release those funds so they're not lost half of that money will be redirected to the municipality where the cup was sold remember we have a geo code for the location of every transaction and that means that the municipalities will receive funding to pay for local sustainability initiatives where the garbage was actually generated the balance of the funds will go to Fisk to fund additional education marketing and awareness and biota sphere to build and deploy additional cup crushing units and both of these initiatives will increase recycling rates so the system becomes more and more efficient and effective over time our current plan is to engage with one or multiple major urban cities to build the initial prototypes and we want to conduct the pilot projects to prove out the system and demonstrate that it can not only work but that it can change the way that both the industry humours look at cups here's how the numbers might play out if we conduct our pilot in the City of Toronto Toronto uses about 600 million not billions six hundred million cups a year and we target the downtown core aiming for about ten percent coverage that would mean printing sixty million of our smart QR coded cups to be used by participating retailers in the core we intend to locate 100 cup crush units in high-traffic areas such as subway stops shopping concourses office lobbies etc with a conservative target return rate of 20% to the machines this assumes that 80 percent would still be disposed of as at present except that the City of Toronto would then receive a significant income from those cups that are not recycled if we're successful the biota sphere returns about three million dollars to its investors in the pilot of course the market potential in North America is 2,000 percent larger than this at a hundred and twenty billion cups per year but that's how we turn twenty five cents into a thirty billion dollar opportunity in North America and a 150 billion dollar global opportunity not only do we solve the world's paper cup problem without destroying the fast food and coffee shop business in the process but we also put billions of dollars into the hands of municipalities for sustainability initiatives as they said at the beginning of the presentation we're already talking to several key players in the space but this project is going to be inclusive so we invite city regional and federal participants players in the fast food and recycling industries as well as commercial and philanthropic investors to reach out to us there's a lot of work still to be done but we believe this initiative can be used to make recycling make sense and make dollars we believe the cup crush initiative is a natural step in the trend towards smart cities harnessing DLT and the internet-of-things to create a major force for positive change in our world the iota foundation and the way to iota community together with groups like the ien am making the next generation protocol of the Internet of Things a reality standards bodies like 'omg and the tangle Iggy Eclipse working group and others will set the standards by which the world will agree to interoperate and cooperate our task is now to get governments and representatives in the food and recycling industries to recognize this unique opportunity to take a leadership position the cup crush project will allow us our children and future generations to have our cake and to eat it too and then wash it all down with a great cup of coffee thank you for listening I was a great presentation Tara thank you really good and as you can see from the comments everyone is wondering this would be the first question oriented broadcasting because you always have the voice of professional radio person I guess it's all in the genes I inherited this this good vocal cord and and I use it whenever I can so thank you it's it's flattering but it's really just in service of a bigger cause yeah so talking about the bigger of course I will and I will look at the chat and see the questions that they have so my first one is obviously as you can imagine the same kind of question that I always get is what is the incentive for the big players the actual people that you need to convince in order for this to not just be an interesting concept but to actually be something that impacts the world so what is your adoption strategy what is center for them so in terms of adoption strategy this is gonna be one of those cases where once this ball snowball starts rolling down the hill it's gonna pick up steam obviously getting the initial players on board is the greatest challenge but we've already had many conversations and very very positive feedback from pulp mills cup manufacturers waste management companies we've been talking literally to people in associations and throughout this ecosystem and all of the feedback so far has been extremely positive the biggest question we always get is you know why would the big retailers like Starbucks and McDonald's and Tim Hortons get on board with something like this and and my responses in in many ways they really can't afford not to actually I think on the second I think I have a slide on this because retailers really know the massive amount of waste that's created by discarded cups and it's a problem that consumers and governments are increasingly concerned about so the retailers know if they don't do something themselves the decision might actually get taken out of their hands and the solution could well be imposed on their business that they really won't like one that could hurt sales and threaten corporate valuations so discarded cups and their environmental impact carry huge reputational brand risk and they don't currently a viable corporate social responsibility answers for this problem they're working on them but they always seem to be further away than then reality and so it's really much more than just a brain teaser that Howard Schultz alluded to in his autobiography I don't think that they can afford to keep kicking the cup down the road much longer so being cast as a global polluter isn't good for business and the first chain that jumps on board is gonna have a significant first mover advantage forcing the others to follow suit I believe that our solution could place retailers ahead of what I see is a coming environmental activism tsunami and this will allow them to ride the wave instead of being buried by it and we can help them solve a problem they'd been wrestling with for years we can make them consumer heroes and they get to make money too and who knows perhaps a major brand could start a profitable new division deploying cup crush units and collecting the lucrative service revenues that flow from them so I don't know if that answers your question but very good answer and yeah to me it makes a lot of sense and I agree with you like this this is a solution for a big problem that's been around for a while where there hasn't been a lot of innovation I would say even though you touched upon what is currently the status quo and in my opinion it's been the same thing for last twenty thirty years yeah believing a lot of innovations so yeah and and we've covered a lot of the the programs that have been talked about like reusable cups and getting people to bring their own cup with them which for the most part is impractical very few people are willing to walk you know with the dirty coffee cup in their handbag or you know sort of where are you gonna put the thing in their backpack and then there are all kinds of issues around cleaning these things and all of that was was stopped with kovat and many of those retailers are now going to be actually increasing the number of paper cups they're giving out because for the foreseeable future reusable and returnable cups are simply not practical solutions in a world of kovat you know I think you have a very good timing for this so my last question before I go through the community questions is how how long would it take you to let's say you get all these people on board right now how long would it take us dpr biosphere to get the first cup crunch out there I think that's relatively fast you know like any development process there will be you know first first alpha prototypes and then you'll refine the the design as you go the biggest challenge is not a technological one building a reverse vending machine is pretty straightforward you know building the components for iota and the tangle are also pretty straightforward the technology's there we've got quarter state coming the the transaction speed in terms of being able to process these things is absolutely coming the scalability is there I don't have any doubts about the technology the biggest challenge and the biggest impediment to getting going is getting all of the players on board as you know only too well it's the politics not the technology that's the the thing that slows you down building shit is easy yeah yeah all of us yes that's something we definitely know so I will go through some of the community question sure so the first one is from NOAA sacromonte or Sukhram on I don't know how you pronounce your last name but it's actually on the same topic that we discussing but it's kind of from a different angle so he is asking which industry players to you feel will be the most challenging to get a hoarder and also just yes he is also asking how he or the IE n network community how can they participate in that process making it more yeah moving your personal army you know it's a very interesting question I think you're seeing around the world that grassroots movements where the people demand a change are coming more and more to the forefront you know if we look at at Greta's movement in terms of getting young people around the world to demand the change that older generations talk about but really get going on i think that kind of grassroots movement is absolutely going to make a difference if you look at the power that a single photograph of a turtle with a plastic straw in its nose had on eliminating plastic straws globally i don't think that turtle ever realized or was properly thanked for its contribution to humanity but it's that kind of grassroots movement that makes an incredible difference straws actually represent a very tiny percentage of the amount of plastic that we need to recycle but that one straw in that one turtle had a dramatic impact and i think when people start demanding of retailers and governments start recognizing that there's only so much landfill that will get people on board and this is this is a problem that people in the industry are aware of they know they have to solve it they've struggled with it they've wrestled with it and we're presenting a solution that not only solves the problem the front end which is where people have always focused or will put a cup tax on the cup and that will dis incent from you know from buying coffee and paper cups well it also hurts the coffee retailers business and we don't want to do that we actually want to make it the same business model but now find a way to actually move that extended producer responsibility which is where it should be so that the people who create the mess are responsible for cleaning up after themselves I mean we were taught that by our mothers as small children you know get a good night's sleep and clean up your mess and that's what we need to do but we're doing it in such a way that everybody actually by looking out for their own selfish rewards actually serve the greatest the greater community and we have a completely self-sustaining circular economy that works not only for all the participants but for consumers and future generations and the planet I hope that's not too wordy as a response Aaron as you said it's not about the platitudes it's really about the action and what I'm most impressed about about this is that you've thought about all the different steps of the weights not just about let's give the the the consumer a little incentive it's really about the entire lifecycle of an in the entire ecosystem around how about life cycle transpires so and your presentation was brilliant I think you've covered virtually old basis maybe the only one that I'm wondering a little bit about you mentioned it briefly was the physic part of this have you been in any dialogue with the regulatory waters of it or is this so fit yeah Fisk would be more of an industry association and we've already had conversations with some as I say of the major players can't say who they are where you know there's the potential for this presentation to be delivered at at a major industry association meeting later this year don't know if that's going to happen or not but the first steps are being taken and as the old saying goes the thousand mile journey begins with a single step and that's what we've done but the fact that as you've mentioned the the presentation addresses all of the players and all of the issues is testament to the fact that we've been in conversation with people and we've shown them our thoughts and ideas and actually gone to them not to say hey here's a great idea but here's a great idea pick holes in it tell us what's wrong tell me what we don't understand about your business tell us what's missing so what you've seen today is actually the result of that sort of feedback so that we've actually thought this through from beginning to end I'm sure there are still other things still to be done but for the most part we really have addressed industry concerns and made sure that everybody is being looked after as we look after the planet yep good answer and I just want to make sure that we get as many questions as I'm sure so one of the things that is being asked a couple of times here so just yeah I will distill it into one question is how do you optimize the usage of this in terms of where do you placed units and also how will that actually look like in a store like if I have these cups I want to discard them and I want to be a participant in this economy how do you optimize that because of course today you pretty much just look at the data where where are people and you try your best to just put it there is there is there any other alternative or how are you thinking about the distribution of these so for the pilot the the plan is to place these in high-traffic areas places where people traditionally you know will deposit and drop off a coffee cup or a cola cup or something like that so typically things like transit hubs you know subway stations large intersections busy shopping malls and we anticipate that for example a shopping mall might actually see this as a traffic builder because now it might have the potential of bringing people to the store and they could even incent people bring your coffee cups to our mall and when you deposit your cup we'll do matching that you can use in any participating retailer in our shopping mall so there's all kinds of things that we can do of course the machines are intelligent agents themselves with their own digital identity so the machines will start to inform us about which units are being used and when they're being used and how they're being used and so that information will allow us and because this whole thing is self-sustaining and self-funding once we get the initial seed money the machines pay for themselves very rapidly and from the data we collect the the refunds on the cups that aren't being used as well as the refunds on the cups that are recycled can then be used to fund more machines and we use the data that we've collected to position these new these new units but all of that would be done together with the city who have a lot of information about garbage collection and disposal and some of it will be worked out in partnership as we go I don't claim to have a magic bullet or a crystal ball but the machines will help us in that process and the amount of data that will be collecting is actually quite staggering and making this an open public data Commons gives governments environmental agencies and the general public visibility into a problem that today is completely buried mostly in the landfill yeah for sure so actually touching up on the last thing you said there kind of segues into identity do you foresee of course as you said there's a lot of creative ways we can do this do you also see that identity will play a role there where you can kind of build up rewards as I think you touched upon your presentation that a certain person or a certain company can kind of gamify this by color tokens or equivalent mechanisms do you see that in the roadmap or is that just kind of like a high-level idea it's interesting one of the the fundamental principles which I have been adamant about from the beginning is that at no time you know if you go into a coffee shop hesitant to sort of name names but today lots of people buy gift cards which they give you know it's a great way to give somebody a gift is to buy you know a gift card at a coffee shop and the moment you register that the retailer then starts tracking all kinds of information about you as an individual how often you drink coffee what kind of drink you order a do order in the morning you know which stores do you locate frequent rather and I'm really adamant that if we do this that it should not actually be part of the surveillance capitalist economy that it should actually protect consumer privacy so your ability to interact with the Machine the way it's envisioned right now will not require any personal identity all you'll need to do is to scan your cup which will have the QR code printed on the bottom of the side that that will then trigger the machine to open once it knows that it's a valid QR code with the deposit on it and the only thing that you'll need to do is to basically show a QR code which will target where your your refund is going to be directed now that might be to your transit card it might be back to the loyalty card for the coffee company and it might be that you know all the kids at a particular school are collecting their parents coffee cups and they were all given a piece of paper with a QR code so that anybody who gives the who puts the the cups in can target the the money to building a new school library or putting our new roof on the local church or you know building a hospital in a developing country but the idea is not to identify the individual and not to compromise individual identity and privacy now digital identity is still important because we need trusted identity for the cup crush machines we need trusted identity for the scanning units that are going to be in the retail stores and used by the collection agents so we do need trusted identity that those machines doing the scanning who or what they claim to be and so that's an important component but I guess you could earn potentially like mana you could earn reputational credit for virtuous deeds but so far that's not part of the of the master plan yeah not for sure yes I think I think we could just brainstorm to do that yeah yeah yeah yeah and I do see a question at the bottom here about plastic bottles and this obviously is a first step but the principles that I've described reproducible and expandable to all kinds of other things where you actually you know apply the same principle whether it's two plastic bottles or two other items like this plastic bottles today I see as being a total scourge on the environment you know it's probably a much bigger problem than and paper cups in terms of the impacts on the environment but you have to start somewhere and there are bottle deposit and return schemes in various parts of the world nobody has taken on the paper cup and it's a problem that literally is littering everywhere we go and I just decided now was the time to to fix it oh yeah I think you right like someone else asked the question of why I started with this random cups and cans no I mean cans and bottles yeah it's exactly because this certain piece have already been started to be addressed whereas gas cups have never even been thought of I think all it was or this bent or of but it hasn't been provided any kind of solution correctly so I I definitely see the novelty there and the importance of actually bringing that topic to the table because I think most people think of cups that's just yeah and they're not aware of the fact that it's even cold and inside I don't think I know that yeah and most people look at the cup and assume that it's paper and they often throw it in a recycling bin and they actually reduce the recycled value of what they've added it to and of course by the time they throw in you know the the coffee dregs and the banana peel and everything else usually what they do is they cross contaminate the whole container and none of it gets recycled it may look like it's getting recycled but behind the scenes recycling is often an illusion there's you know a lot of really good movies about this and we plan on posting some stuff at the biota sphere website with links to movies and videos like the story of stuff and various other you know background resources that sort of cast light on the way that the recycling industry works or in this case doesn't work yeah so I will take two more questions and then we can go into show project and I felt I felt but I feel bad yeah bad for ban who's waiting in the wings there so there's one question from Tobias Mayer that I just saw here yeah you kind of just ask almost rhetorically 600 billion cups that's a hell of a lot of TPS needed so you made an estimate that if this is successful you could aim for 20% in the short medium term and I'm just going to ask you are you confident that this will be able I'd like have you done any sort of math on I or I should probably be the one answering that's why I'm laughing because I'm gonna ask the question right back at you David I mean the beautiful thing here is even if we just look in North America and you know I have to be a realist we're not gonna get every single cup manufactured printed with a QR code let alone sold with the deposit and added onto the ledger but every single cup is going to produce somewhere in the region of I don't know ten to fifteen data transactions and about eight to ten value transactions so however many cups you have you actually have to multiply that number by about twenty in terms of the number of transactions that would actually occur on the tangle now obviously I'm betting on iota and the iota foundation and quarter side so let me throw that right back at you can I move forward safe in the knowledge that that by the time we get all of the players on board this is not going to happen tomorrow or the day after but by the time we get the players on board and we deploy the prototypes and we start scaling it up I mean this is the reason that iota is the only legitimate and viable technology in my mind that could actually solve for this problem because of its scalability over to you answer your own question interesting point because of course you start think about scalability people are like okay this is cool it's all theoretical etc but here you have an actual use case where you make it more tangible so I know for a fact that chorus side with slicing / shorting this woman not to be a problem at all so actually it would just be very beneficial like we're in transactions as possible so right so that can't we ask this question cool and the other great thing here of course is that you know when you talk about slicing and sharding you know a coffee cup is going to be purchased at a store and redeemed at a cup crush machine probably no more than fifteen or twenty miles away so it's not like you need to have an entire global DLT handling every single transaction most of these transactions are going to be very localized and again the the sorts of solution that the iota foundation of proposing with slicing and and this sort of multiverse of of tangles is perfectly suited to solve the sort of problem that we're addressing ya know certainly and I see just one last question before we move over to Ben you keep saying that yeah this is from Tom Scott yeah he says I would love this for festivals most PF I guess that's petrol fueled or something okay then we really had thinking in environment - yeah that's true a lot of festivals try to do their best to make some cool gimmicks but I guess the bigger question here is actually what is to scale that these cup crush machines could process he asks actually in the second year I see that he actually asks how many per minute whereas I don't think that's even relevant because the iota network in hamlets and if there's if you see a bigger demand that like there's a huge queue you simply get another cup of punch machine yes or make it faster yeah yeah so I think a masters itself I just want to make sure yeah I see some people are asking all the questions about other things like cigarette butts etc and straw it's definitely it's it's a valid question we have to start somewhere and I did extrapolate into every single ways that humanity makes because yeah yeah and and you know if we dive into the minutiae I think we miss the big picture quite literally but in terms of Tobias's question you know the great beauty of these machines is just like you bring in porta-potties to a festival you could bring in cup crush machines that could be used whether it's for paper cups or if we expand into plastic bottles to do exactly the same thing the machine itself in addition to crushing and accepting the cups will also be able to do things like air quality monitoring but it could also have since it's going to need some connectivity whether it's 5g or Wi-Fi so at a festival the cup crush machine can also be a source of Wi-Fi signal or a 5g signal it's gonna have its own GPS code so that it knows where it's physically located so again we know where the cup was sold we know where the cup was migrated if you think about it we can actually start showing people how many cups were actually sold and recycled at that festival we can start to show people how far the average cup moves between vending and refunding because we know the Geo codes for those two events so you know government agencies even the retailers will start to know how far do our cups move where do they go you know you can start tracking in the same way that Google Maps has the ability to track us as people I don't want that ability via coffee cup which is why I don't want any personally identifiable information and I want this to be completely gdpr compliant but we can track the cup because nobody really cares about tracking the cup and it would be really interesting to we're cups Flo and how long they take before they get recycled or how long they live between vending and discarding those kinds of things so huge potential total amounts of data that are would become available to government agencies for their own planning is is staggering and none of it is available today none of it has ever been available before and it's all available and no extra cost because the audit trail is immutable it's trusted and it's it comes in and no extra charge just as a function of operating the network ya know I think this is a tremendous application of ir a-- and not just it's not even about bi or air Dosher it's about iota but on the other hand it's more about actual thing and I know it's just there in the background making it possible yeah and most most of the the partners that we're talking about frankly they don't care about iota they care about the business problem and solving the business problem and if I or happens to be the the technology to solve it great if there was a better solution they'd use that I just don't know of a better solution and obviously I you know would like to think that I can do my part for the for the community and the network here but it really is the best tool to get this job done and and I notice down here I saw a a message in here from Dennis yeah introductions to anybody from within the community if you have connections if if you know people especially at the government level because at the government level we can make a lot of stuff happen but government's only have so much power we need everybody on board this will be a community and a collective effort but ultimately we all share the planet we better start taking care of it and and make a profit while we're doing it there's nothing wrong with that not certainly so just be a good host because this is my first run long single like this I I thank you a lot for the presentation it's tremendous I think the project is going to really open the eyes of people and also bring a lot of new players to the aura ecosystem so hopefully that Cup will go into a cup crimes in the future I mean we hope so you
