 hi all I'm dance mag Brad founder that we get around Network forum today is Thursday May 28 2020 and you're watching wgan TV live at five our show today show and tour property websites and digital asset delivery by show and tour our guest today hey Josh good to see you as Kansas city-based Josh Mays Josh is the owner of Sherpa media and show and tour so if you're seeking property websites for your matter port or other 3d or 360 tour are you wondering how best to deliver your digital assets are you are you do you need to display more than one matter port digital twin in the city in the same tour in the same player if so you're in the right place today's show Josh before we jump in how about just telling us up maybe a big picture about sure per media and show in tour yeah also so as you said I'm based in Kansas City I've been a professional photographer videographer and virtual tour provider full time for the last five six plus years and so I'm very familiar with the industry and you know the everything that goes along with virtual tours and photography and as I've developed as a business owner I've seen a number of challenges come up so one of the big things that I've seen is the increased competition in our space I'm seeing new photographers pop up every day the barrier to entry is getting lower and lower not only do we have to compete against other photographers locally but we're also competing against national companies and it's and now we're actually competing against camera manufacturers so competition is just increasing on top of that we have you know new technologies always getting better you're better and easier so with that again the barrier to entries little easier as as things progress and so with these external forces we we have to find ways to increase our value and basically find new ways to increase to provide a better client experience so with those desires I've developed showing to her me and my teammate Brian he's the developers on the back end he's awesome really skilled he's the one you know typing away every day making show into what it is but we've been in development for the last we last year year and a half launched in November so we're a new company and so that's that's what started it and that's the desire basically to add more value equip our clients and create a better client experience of our customers terrific so what is what does that look like what a show and show and tour looked like at the big picture before we jump into a demo so we're showing tour there's a number of things that you can create and so it basically we have tools to help you save time tools to help you clip your clients and so that includes property websites we have a awesome drag-and-drop property website builder we have really professional-looking project delivery pages that allow you to give your clients you know full through view of the project in a very professional way it's going to look better than a just a Dropbox link where they have to figure out where the download button is we make it super easy super professional on those project delivery pages you can include a payment button that you know just pops open a box where they can input their credit card that page also allows you to lock downloads links and embed codes until your clients paid you so another time-saving thing to help you you know you should get paid on time in addition we let you create what we call it media players the media player is basically a way for you to combine multiple forms of media into a single player that can be embedded on any page so youyou hinted at it at the beginning you can combine multiple Madhupur tours together there's lots of different use cases for that you can combine you know a photo gallery of video and matter port so it just gives the photographer more freedom on how they display their content and put their clients we also let you connect your own domain names so we don't lock you into purchasing domain names from us we allow you to purchase domain names wherever you want and then add those to your content so you can basically you know brand everything to your business our whole system is meant to be photographer first so the photographer is always number one priority and how you know the branding is displayed our system is completely white labeled to that photographer to your branding so you don't have to see any show into her branding at all and we're taking that to the next level and we're finding ways to continue to let the photographer brand themself over even virtual tour providers the virtual tour platforms and that's something I'll show you later and give you more detail on that with everything we create everything is you can password protect it along with there's automatic SSL Certificates so everything's secure and password protected also gives you freedom to create basically however you want so a lot of systems charge you based on purpura per project but our system is built to give you freedom to build as many projects as you need so you can build as many property websites media players delivery pages as you want and we'll get into pricing and exactly kind of how that works later in the show awesome I've been keeping track or I've been attempting to keep track as you talked about each of the different features that show and tour offers I'm sort of between ten and twelve and in height and how you count so I would say show and tour is a Swiss Army knife solution a cloud-based software solution to help your target audience would be real estate photographers in particular real estate virtual tour photographers and if you're doing video even better so maybe that's focus on this this industry so everything is meant to be for real safety offers videographers and virtual tool providers awesome I think that probably leads us into to doing a deep dive demo and I'm gonna actually ask you for three kinds of demos first is to take a look at show and tour from the perspective of someone buying or selling a home what does that experience like who what is it like from the real estate agent or real estate brokers perspective and three what is the back end experience like from the photographer's perspective how about share screen jump in and take it from there absolutely can you see my screen okay I can thank you so yeah we're gonna start with the experience from the home buyers perspective so I'm just on and realtor.com listening this is a shoe that I personally did a couple weeks ago you know with these listing websites there's limited media that you can display on them you know realtor.com isn't good you know they do a good thing where you can actually see the matter port virtual tours with a 3d view button but they also display a vr tour button which is nice and so that's the MLS virtual tour link you would you can equip your your real estate agent with a link to put input in here and basically that'll take us to a property website that we've made will show into it so the benefit of the property website is it allows you to you know fully customize the experience and put any type of media maybe that's a video multiple virtual tours you know a couple different photo galleries different text it basically just gives you way more freedom than what you would find on you know a standard real real estate listing so with this example you know we've a typical property website would you know show the property info we've got the virtual tour you know I went a little bit fast for me and I think it's a limitation of our technology of how we do this so it's not as silky smooth as perhaps a consumer would experience since you're sharing this with me tied in to the web it's a little bit harder so I'm just trying to go down the to kind of in between this page in the next page and I'm getting to see some highlights of info can you just scroll down just see if it's right or a little bit slower right there boom yeah okay so if you could pick it up from here that's great yeah so basically the property website it acts as an online brochure that is fully customizable to all the content you create for your client it's just more customizable than its typical real estate listing so we've got the property info section and I will note that this is the unbranded version this is the MLS version without the agent information I can show you the the version that has agent branding on it and we've got property info quick facts a description you know field that you can upload any PDF so this was improvements made to the home you know spreadsheet that the agent wanted us to upload below that we've got the virtual tour and you'll also notice at the top as we scroll we've got a quick menu you can see it starts at the bottom and then as you scroll it goes to the top so this is a matter port or you know displayed nicely on the page as we continue to scroll we'll see our nice photo gallery it displays vertical images really nicely in a mosaic style all the images can be clicked on full screen another nice benefit is providing in providing these property websites is that they're gonna the photos are going to be displayed at a much higher resolution than what you would find on you know MLS so make sure your your agent is you know presenting the best there we've got a contact form and a map section at the bottom of every property website we do have the photographer's branding this is again one of those things that photographer always comes first photographers gonna have their branding and link to the website that's another really great benefit of property websites and providing these virtual tour links is you want to be associated with your project because not only our home buyer is looking at this you know seeing if they're interested in home but we've also got other agents looking at this and they're gonna see your work they want to know if you produce this content so that helps you get clicks to your website Josh where's your logo for sure per media was that a hyper link back to your website yes it was so if we click on that that'll jump over to struck the media okay great thank you and so is this the would this be an appropriate time to show is the branded version of what the the home buyer or home seller would see if they were looking at it not in the MLS but an agent sent it directly to a home buyer or home seller yeah so it's basically the format's gonna be the same all its gonna do is add back in the agent branding and so with the branded tour agents can use these as just again a online brochure the best way to share that listing with potential buyers my agents share these on social media this show really nicely on social media as a link they share them on the sign rider in the front yard so we've got a nice short link that they can just put at the top of the sign again online brochure people don't have to get up and get a piece of paper they can just type it in their phone as they you know park in front and then they can easily share these over email so it's it's really just a really awesome way to equip your client another point that recently got brought up by one of our users is that this helps agents potentially grab those buyers so they can get both sides of the Commission and so not only you know agents a lot of agents might just push their stuff on MLS and hope you know other agents bring the buyer this can help them showcase the listing on their own outside of the MLS and try to get the buyers themselves and double their Commission mm-hmm don't take it can you take us back to the to the agents info so there's a lot going on there in terms of customization so we have the agents photo a big big print for their name with a subtitle phone number in this example you have hyperlinks for email Facebook Instagram LinkedIn and web bless you have the logo I'm guessing that logo is also hyperlinked um this logo is not it's not theirs there's the link for the web okay great yeah so that agent information is all you can input and it gets synced to all the different web sites okay I will get there let's say on just the the consumer facing side of what a homebuyer or host home seller would see can you take us down to the bottom I just wanted to see if there was anything that was different about that lead generation form yep so we got the Asian information contact card and so yeah it's basically displaying those contact cards you can add multiple agents so if you have two or three it's functional so we might see multiple contact cards appear here and above as well yeah okay great and then below is a map yeah and then in terms of the great okay great in terms of the URL can you talk to us a little bit about that right there yeah absolutely so this one is an example for my business I have it set up with a custom domain name Casey back tours and so all of our property websites are built on Casey tours and then our system just adds the address at the end but you can make this and we'll get into that on the backend I'm sorry I got a little bit ahead of myself so sir is there anything else to show us on the consumer facing side the person who buys a house the person who's buying a house or selling a house that's it on the property website I could show you what a media player looks like from the consumer side we'll give us that would be great I know show and tour has some special features regarding its player and so that would be good well why don't you talk about what page were on even even before we get to this so there's somebody wanted to come back and and look at this you maybe just scroll up it to the top for a second yeah we're on the Sean tour examples page show intercom /et so if you wouldn't mind let's just go back to your logo in the top left click on that and that's where we are show and tor.com show a nd tor.com and then I think you were going to click on the examples and in case anyone wants to follow along with us on their own website okay great we just looked at a property website we're going to jump down and look at a media player and this is a real estate example and so the media player I described it quickly before but it's a way to combine multiple forms of media to a single player that can be embedded on a website so this is a live example this is embedded on our example page but you can use this media player as a standalone website as well so that's why I wanted to show you this now is if we go to this media player online you can input this media player as the virtual tour link in MLS if you prefer it's just another way to display your content and of course brand yourself with it as well so we do have the the link to your website in the bottom left corner and so this in this example we've got a photo gallery that you know you can just click through we've got a video I won't play that it'll start blaring some music and then we've got a virtual tour in this example it's a Zillow virtual tour so that's another another way that a homebuyer would experience the end product and again this media player can be shared from an agent you know text email social media whatever it may be okay so let's pause here just for a second Josh because this is super important show and tour player works with matter port Zillow 3d home what else it works with everything so basically anything you can embed you can input as a tab and the player isn't that awesome so regardless of the 3d or 360 virtual tour platform a photographer is using show and tour is platform agnostic meaning it will work with with any 3d 360 virtual tool or platform as well as video such as YouTube Vimeo yeah exactly and that's we're all about freedom and giving the photographer the ability to basically do whatever they want I know I'm all for that so that's what we're trying to provide it's about users okay so does you you're a real estate photographer you're a virtual tour creator so this is a show and tour is a platform created with the vision by the vision of a real estate the DNA of a real estate photographer absolutely yeah I'm sorry I was just gonna say another big value I don't think I mentioned it is as service providers if we're trying to sell multiple services to a client we need to give them a platform to actually display this that content so it actually helps you sell your services so I learned early on that when I was trying to offer agents photography video virtual tour all in a single listing they'd be like where do I put this what do I do with it and so that eliminates that question by providing a media player or a property website unless you did you know just give a quick them like they should be awesome now if you go back to your examples page I seem to recall that we saw two examples there and the other player was different so what's different about this example of show and tour yeah so this meaning player is at three different amount of port virtual tours combined to into a single player this specific example was for an air B&B that had multiple rooms in the same house that they rented out and so they wanted individual AmeriCorps tours for each room but they also wanted a way to show them all so people can click through each rim so we've got you know the different rims here we've got the Westside real Crestwood room and then a Valentine and so again there's there's really a lot of freedom that you have when combining things it's simple we've just got tabs I'll show you on the vacuum how easy it is then again on the left side it says created by Sherpa media again that that is a hyperlink and so you as a photographer you have a choice of putting your photography business there or your agents info right now it just displays the photography business okay so it's got a yeah created by link gives you the credit wait great thank heavens somebody is actually giving the photographer credit for for our work what it's concept excuse me now I noticed you have two different share links can you describe what those on that particular player can do you describe those two different share links well what this is that's the matter for specific share button so that's you know this is the actual amount of port tour and then we've got a share link for the whole player so this is what I went to before to show you that you know that full screen version but that's that's what you just need to sharing that's there okay great now I also notice there's a caption and a headline was is that part of this is Oak Street mansion part of the player or was that added as part of your website so you're talking about the link here no no if we go if we go just underneath your player oh right here vacation part of the player or is that added on your website so the player so is just yeah just the box here okay great now if I was not delivering a a 3d or 360 virtual tour 24/7 open house could that be a video absolutely yeah you can you don't even have to display multiple things so it could be a single piece of content so maybe you just simply want to use it as a container for your content into a delete to your website and a share button that's in 90 years okay great so is there as part of our three phase demo here is there anything else the show from a someone who's planning to buy a house or sell a house perspective um that's pretty much it those are the end products yeah great so Josh how about a demo of sure show and tour from a real estate agents perspective yeah so the real estate agent will get their content from photographer and a nice professional email and I've got an example email hold up Josh I see you looking almost the 90 degrees there is your screen like a 60-inch monitor on your desktop there now is that my small stuff I don't want you to see yeah okay so basically this is what the email would look like when you are sending the project to a client the emic the contents of this email can be changed and customised we've got a nice excuse me so Josh this is a template from the show and tour platform to generate a email to the real estate agent exactly so this is how you can professionally deliver your project to a client and so we've got a big view project button that'll take us to the project delivery page which I'll click on that in a minute then we've got additional links down here to directly to the property website if you want to add those as well we've got your photographer branding on the bottom okay so for clarification that logo at the bottom is the is the photographer's logo in this case for show and tour your photography business your matter port service provider business is sure poor media and that's why we're seeing that particular photographer as an example exactly so anytime you see sharpen media you can just imagine your own logo in that place because yeah that's my photography business that we're using okay well I see three different links presumably you're going to show us each of those three links yeah you project button in this first link they're the same thing great the property website is what we've actually already seen from realtor comm so this is the same listing so we've already seen the property website let's go ahead and jump into view project so this is your clients experience when they you know are receiving the project you'll notice at the top we have a secure link this is a string of random characters so this this page is not meant to be shared publicly it's meant to just be shared with you and your client you can password protect this page if you're concerned about security but by default you know it's not password protected it's just as securely that only your client will see now this is a project I've already sent out and it's been paid if it has not been paid and you did add payment to this page this would show I'm a pay now button and I can show you an example in a bit what that looks like but once it's been paid it's going to show invoice pay it's gonna have a view invoice button and I will note that this only will scrub paid if you are integrating with stripe or QuickBooks so that's a picture I haven't mentioned yet I don't think is that you can connect your stripe and QuickBooks accounts and our system will actually talk with those accounts and mark invoices is paid you can create invoices in those systems I'll show you how easy it is to create invoices we we decided to do that to bring invoice creation into our software to streamline your whole process because I found you know as you're uploading photos and creating you know your delivery page your property website there's always also the to create and so we put it in one place so you can be doing that with things uploading I'll show you that later so on this delivery page there's lots of things to look at and again it's fully customizable to what your project has attached to it so all these are just sections that you can add on the backend and you don't need to add any of these if they're not relevant to start at the top we have the property website that's what we've looked at already there is an automatic branded and unbranded link included the unbranded is what we first looked at without that client information and then we have a view website visit website button that takes them to another tab in less than view that coffee website then we've got the rest of the content and you can arrange the order if you prefer all this in different orders this is the Madhupur example so allows them to preview the virtual tour get the direct link get the embed code just a really you know clean way to deliver that rather than an email if you know a long string of links and embed codes personally I don't think that you know comes across very well doesn't look as clean then we've got the photo gallery now with photos from the photographer point of view you just gotta upload the highest resolution photos that you want to deliver to your client and then our system will automatically downscale those images to different websites and so the default web size the default download sites is the 2048 pixels wide but you can click this drop down and download the full resolution or the smaller websites if your client once do they can select on on the individual images click through the photo gallery we do have a look there we go they do have a individual image download button here as well if they just want to download image and then what I did here this is actually just thing my client likes but this is an example where you can have multiple photo galleries so this is just a second photo gallery exception my client likes me to deliver vertical images as a combined horizontal image so I just created a second photo gallery to give them those combined vertical images but you can use in other words you can have as many photo galleries as you want I've also used a second photo gallery to deliver social media cropped images so I like to sometimes provide my clients with square crops that they can just draw on Instagram so there's a lot of flexibility on how you deliver your content we do have an invoice paid button up here on the top right that you know obviously is showing invoice pay because this invoice has been paid but it hasn't it'll have a Pay Now button and then once you click that your client will be able to to pay right on the screen and of course we do have the photographer logo and link to the website in the top left so this delivery page just like everything else works with any Content how about a video I didn't see video this example doesn't let me just exit out of fees so I would imagine when you're delivering the video you're delivering either the Vimeo link or the youtube link exactly so let's go here so this is an example delivery page that has not been paid I created that an invoice thread for this this is just an example but basically if they have not paid for the project we've got this pay now button and it pops up and making it to the credit card okay can you fill that out so we can see how that works yep oh sorry I was just kidding I asked you for all your credit card a little levity how about viewing the invoice can we take a look at that yeah that's just gonna download the acts Oh PDF and I'm not going to open that up show some of my business information okay so that's going to download the actual PDF from QuickBooks or from stripe it's pulling the real invoice there and then I will say on the Pay Now button if you click show details that drops down it shows all the line albums in that invoice they focus from the real estate agents perspective and we'll cover the the how to from a photographer's in a whole separate demo that you'll get to video it's going to display the same exact way as a virtual tour with Lincoln embed code and then you can preview the video and and this if you wanted to deliver segments of videos it's just just multiple videos that get delivered yep all these are just seconds and you can add as many sections as you want okay great is there so if I let's talk a little bit about the payment integration here can I get all my digital assets whether I pay or not pay yes let me I can lock this project real fast let me do it and I'm I'll I'm doing this on the back end and we'll go over the back in a second but I'll just do this off-screen for now I'm going to go ahead and lock fresh the page all might take a minute it's probably cached but yeah okay so how'd that Mary could you let's say let's make sure well this one doesn't want to work but base I'll create a new project an adult and I'll show you it'll be a lock lock all downloads oh here goes it is locked I just didn't realize basically it gives you prompts to pay in order to download so it's going to pop up the pinyon box so I can see everything I could click on each of the photos I just can't download them that's right the the virtual tour is going to love in the background you can't interact with it it's gonna have a lock and you know you paid to view just like that okay so I can't even play the videos etc everything's soon pay to view so as soon as I as the real estate agent pay the bill then I can see the tour then I can see the photos then I can download and get links yep okay so if any of our viewers have ever had a problem sending an invoice to a client and chasing after them forever and a day that they may the photographer may choose to say Oh for client a I'm gonna require it going forward required them to pay at the time that they get delivery and for my other clients that I know that they pay in a timely fashion I'm not going to lock down my digital assets they'll be able to download it and though and they'll pay the bill when they normally pay the bill so I have a choice as a photographer yep okay great is there anything else to see from the real estate agents perspective that's pretty much it that's what they would experience from the email to the project where they can get downloads and links and everything mm-hmm okay and where am i I'm having trouble finding finding you on my screen so how about if you could take us off screen share just for a moment okay and I've lost you on my desktop I have so much stuff open literally I don't know where my zoom screen went I'm not much of a television producer here I guess you can I presume you can see me okay yeah I can see literally I have so much open I can't I can't see okay well as long as you know that we're on full screen now I'm gonna have you have you make sure that we're doing the right thing because I've actually lost my window okay let's see what I wanted to ask you okay so we've seen everything from the agents perspective of digital assets I guess is there a dashboard for an agent there's not a dashboard we keep it really simple to where they just get a link and download everything from that email okay got it so how about from the perspective of the photographer okay and I found my zoom window so I can actually see you now okay so we're gonna take a look at showing tour from the perspective of the real estate photographer a virtual tour photographer of how everything that we just have seen for branded unbranded tour how it's all delivered now we're on the the back end for in this case Sherpa media yep exactly okay great and so this is what the dashboard looks like you know this is obviously my personal example our personal dashboard filled out with projects and clients when you're on the dashboard we've got multiple things to show you here this top row these six projects these are going to be your six most recent projects so it's kind of a quick access bar the projects you've you know modified the latest we've got your new project a new client button will actually create a project from scratch in a minute and then below that is your list of clients projects there's a couple different layouts you can arrange them and we've got the grid layout and then we've also got a list layout so this just displays everything in alphabetic order in two different columns the last way to navigate to get to a project your client is the search bar so you can just start typing and you know click on the project that way so several different ways to navigate all the you know hundreds of projects you might have in your dashboard we've also got let me move this we've also got some settings in the top right we'll go over that towards the end I think we've got some profile settings help will take you to our help articles then you can sign out we you can upload your logo that's going to show on the dashboard here and you'll also notice this dashboard is on my own domain name so you can put it on your own domain if you like to just fully you know brand it to yourself pretty much you're the only one that's gonna see it but it's always nice to you know put everything on your domain name so with that said I'll probably start by jumping in the project that we've been looking at and then we'll create a project from scratch so let's go to the example that we've looked at a couple times this is the project specific dashboard you'll notice the three things we've been looking at a property website deliverables the or delivery page and the media player each one of these has the builder on the right-hand side and then you have some settings on the left for all three there they're built the same way your project also has some additional project settings and then you're sent project button so I'll go ahead and dive into some of these specific things that you can do when you're starting on a project you typically want to start on the deliverables page so at minimum you're probably using us to send your project and then you know you might may or may not build out a proper website or media player so when you're on your deliverables page all you got to do is add the sections that you need and so for this example we've already added sections we've got a photo gallery we've got a Zillow virtual tour and we've got a video but if you needed to add to add these sections you basically are just clicking this plus button and then you add the type of section that you need so if we want to add a second photo gallery we would just click photo gallery and then you can drag images up here up into this box you can also upload panoramas and so this would display as a 360 panorama I'm gonna delete that photo gallery for now at any time as you're building you can click on this preview button in the top right corner that preview button is going to take you to the live example that you can you know you can see how all the content is displayed and so this is what we just view I just you know edited this project to lock the downloads and so that's going to show you that live view if you're on preview you can jump between tabs so we can't jump over to the property website or the media player from this view as well close that preview and then each page again built the same way this we're now on the media player tab we've already added for a photo gallery a video in a virtual tour you can add another you can add a Maps section to the media player let's go ahead and do that that maps was already created on another on another tab so that's why it pulled up but if I click preview here we now have a map section at the bottom of the media player that's gonna pull up this this property I'm going to delete that map section you can just you know that each one of these sections does have different settings that you can manipulate some of the virtual tours that we recognize such as a matter port or Zillah virtual tour some of the more common ones we do have some advanced settings that you can so in this for example the matter court you can you know change the back the preview image and then you can check on and off the mls version of that Oh for clarification so with that I think of that as the hero image is that so that crown image it only displays for a second basically when I click on the preview here it's this image right here as it's loading okay so that might be the exterior of the house yeah if that if I didn't begin the tour you happen to be beginning the tour on the exterior of the house but if I wanted an exterior of the house to be that preview image this is where that would be changed yeah okay so that's the media player to meet players the most simple one we've got that link to the media player if you want to quickly access that the auto transition and that's going to jump between taps automatically so if you have it on a page you know it shows a little bit of movement let's hop over to the deliverables page now the deliverables in the property website pages have two sections we've got the header in the Quick Links and then the deliverables page also has a product payment section here now the project payment it's gonna I've already created an invoice for this project and so it's already here created it shows it's do this invoice created in QuickBooks so this invoice was credited with showing to her and then pushed in to push it into QuickBooks okay and is it compatible is showing tour compatible with QuickBooks and QuickBooks or inline it's compatible with QuickBooks Online and stripe okay and QuickBooks the the non online version it doesn't work with QuickBooks not desktop it only works with QuickBooks Online quickbooks online okay great and so you can download the invoice here when we create a project from scratch i'll show you how to actually invoice these quicklinks that's gonna be your top menu bar if you want to you can you know adjust how this type of menu looks we do have a desktop and mobile that you can separate out so if you want desktop and mobile to look differently and then the header this is something you'll probably adjust every time this is where you would choose your background image that first you know big header background image and then you can change what that page heading says you can change the size of the header as well so if we some people you know I think most people use the header but if you don't want to you can turn it off and then that just jumps straight down without that top header into the first section on that page the last tab here is the property website again so the property website has different specific sections so we've got a property info section with all the you know various property information that you can add for this example we get Zillow we've got a text section that shows up on the front end just like that so if you have a little bit of text you can display that we've got a photo gallery and video and so on again you all you gotta do is just add sections with that plus button and then add the type of section you need so it's really easy when you get used to system you can create a project delivery page property website in just a few minutes so it's super fast there are different settings here on the left again you've got your password protection get your branded unbranded links if you need to access those and then we have the contact cards so this allows you to make changes to this client information on this project only so we do have a separate section that haven't shown you yet for the actual client profile that's gonna you know input all their information and push that out to all the different property websites but if you this contact card to show different information on this specific project you can change that here or you can if you have multiple clients attached to this project you can hide one of them as well so a use case for that is let's say I add a second client on this project but this second client is just for let's say they're an admin person and so you you added them because you want them to also get this email but you don't want that admin person to show up on the property website all we'd have to do is just hide them on this page so that's awesome that's really cool yeah so that's just a kind of a use case there we again have the header section this header section also has a header action button and that's what if I click on preview here that's what this top button is you can make it basically jump down to any section so maybe you wanted to jump down to property info first or the virtual tour and then we have a header action text so I just changed it it was property info I'm going to change into virtual tour and we'll see it on the preview in now size explore space it's going to jump to the virtual 0 mm-hmm so you have flexibility on that top button [Music] same Quick Links same concept last thing we'll show you here are the project settings this is how you can change the project name this project name is going to be automatically created from the property address if you didn't input a property address you can make the project name whatever you want you can't change the property address here as well it's integrated with Google so you don't have to type in the full address once you type it in once it's going to autofill it and then again you just saw me do it you can add more clients to a project this way and then this is also where you can change the domain name for a project so our system is super flexible when it comes to the domain name you just simply type in the domain name you want and so I'll show you how to connect domain names through the system so that they're accessible here but right now the default domain name is show dot tours that's available to everyone that signs up but for my business I've connected KC tours we've seen that already so if I just type in KC tours it shows that it's available and gives me a green check I can change this property website to be KC doctor or such the address if I want that extension to be something completely different you know just typing in random things oh this could be the domain name could could be a selling point that the photographer makes it the real estate agents yeah if you do so you can add any domain name that you own or have access to its DNS settings and so if you have access to that you can connect to our system and build out property websites and projects on those domain okay so I could imagine I probably want to keep it as a photographer so I'm benefiting from the SEO exactly okay so I'm not gonna save that but that's how you would change a domain name and add a custom domain name I'm going to show you on the example that we create from scratch how to actually add a calm and so it'll be the address calm and so I think that's mostly it we've got the same project button this is that email we we looked at you can edit what the default email looks like in your profile settings but you can also just edit here specifically so if you're not delivering a property website you can just delete that out of the project in Sinope copy to yourself so this is a way to you know just confirm it got sent a lot of people like that peace of mind so you can you know copy yourself there change the email subject and you can add email addresses to this email as well so if you didn't have them connect to the project but you still wanted to email to someone else you can you select an existing client or you can just type in that email okay I know it was click sending that delivers that professional clean email that we've already looked at as you're making changes you would just click publish changes and it saves life I'm not gonna save I don't even remember all the different things I changed on this project so I'm not gonna save it if you exit out it won't it won't save what you've done it is gonna warn you that you've exited and have it saved but that's okay in this example so I think the next best thing is to create a project from scratch and show you how that works so I'm gonna create this listing that I've already done from scratch we've got 45 24 Terra Street it knows your location so it's Auto filling in Google Maps it pops in the project name this client you start typing it's going to you know pop them up there and that's all you need to do to start creating a project so we're in a project you know it's the same format just we haven't added our content I pretty much always start with the photo gallery I'm going to drag in my images from Adobe bridge and you can see those will start to upload you can start working on other things as the upload so I like to start creating the invoice these invoices are actually being pulled from QuickBooks so if you did create that invoicing QuickBooks already you can just select it and it pulls it and pulls it right in so you don't have to create the invoice within our system but if you did want to create an invoice from scratch you just click create invoice and that pops up this box to start basically just typing in your line items and so for this example these are actually products and services from my QuickBooks account and so you just start typing in your line items whatever you charge it's pretty simple I have my services broken down between real estate business so it shows you the different QuickBooks categories and if you know there's those different things you can put a description so this would be you know maybe it's a you charge by image and metaphor maybe you charge by square feet so it gives you some details are the invoice creation is automatically going to pull in the project name and link to the delivery page so that's on every invoice so you can associate that invoice for the project and that your client if they go to that invoice they can get the link to all your content right from the invoice you can change the invoice date the terms apply this count and you can just add whatever line items you want I'm gonna click done and so this invoice won't actually get published and pushed into QuickBooks until you publish the page and then this is also where you can decide to disable downloads before payment or not and so why I've created that invoice the photos have already uploaded if you're just delivering photos you're basically done the last thing you might do is add the background image for the header so it's as simple as just you know selecting the image you want a lot of times this is just the the front for this example I like that at the back of this house that are really awesome back patio so I like that is that front image we're gonna turn on our header and click preview so our delivery page was made in just this couple minutes we've got our pay now button and then everything else below it locked until they pay for this example I did also do a matter port so we're gonna go ahead and add that so format port or video or any media that is you know external basically you would click external media let me copy over my matter port link just copy that in press ENTER press that button and it's gonna load the medic port right in you don't have to do anything else again with matter port since we recognize the link there are some cool advanced settings this is similar to other things you might see more you can just easily click a button and hide some things we are wanting to expand this customization in the future but right now we've got some some simple things you can customize typically there might be a little bit small for our viewers to see from home so the enable QuickStart yeah great thank you zoom then so that's what's currently there you know but typically you don't have to change much we just added the matter port and if we could create it let me just ask on the matter port so if I wanted to add parameters to the link you'll still accept whatever parameters have been added to control that matter port space absolutely okay yeah and so we built out the deliverables page if we want to deliver it a property website we do need to add that to the delivery page so that would be that section with the links and that visit website button so we just add that property website you'll see a couple features here come in soon basically this these features are going to allow the agent to edit the website themselves so that you know will speed up the workflow photographer right now the photographer has input the information themselves I'm so if we click preview there we just added this property website section and since it's locked we're not seeing it I'm gonna go ahead and unlock this page and so yeah we've got to brand it in on Brandon links let's go ahead and jump over to the property website tab build that out we can start with the header we've already got all the images uploaded we don't have to re-up load anything I need to upload them in the order that I want so the on the when you're choosing the background image it's pulling from what we call the media library and these are just going to show in the order that they upload it to our system but in the actual photo gallery section you can rearrange them in whatever order you want you can you know do my upload date you can do it by file name whatever you want you can you know rearrange individual images you can select multiple images and rearrange that way so personally I rename all the images first and put them in so I don't really have to mess with them on the site but so back to the brevity website we've got our header I'm gonna go ahead and add our different sections so since we've already uploaded photos and a Macbook tour they're going to show up in our existing media so we don't have to be upload or change anything we just saw I just added a photo gallery there's a couple different options I don't think I've shown yet we've got a slide show in a grid layout that grid layout is that mosaic style grid the slide show is going to be that full full screen version of the photos if you prefer that style I'll add the matter port link in there let's go ahead and just add all the different sections property info map contact form that's pretty much the basics can I we great so you're rearranging the order now okay exactly so you just drag on the left side whatever order you want I usually do it property info first then either matter port or photo gallery contact formula map now that we've added sections we can choose the header action button so you know view property info or view property photos turn on that header now the property info this is what we're going to add to where the agent can add in their own information but for now I'm just going to copy it over from realtor.com for this example so we have something to see there are other parameters that you can add so we do have a full list of quick facts that you can include so I think this one did give us lots of square footage so we'll go ahead and do that and this is where you can add documents as well so there we go we've got our property info section I'm going to change that photo gallery back as I personally like the grid layout [Music] and then we've got a property website is the metaphoric contact form and Google Maps and then of course photographer at the bottom the media player this one will be the quickest since we've got everything already uploaded we just click photo gallery matter port and that media player was just made so we've got the two different tabs photos and virtual tours a little bit fast for me if I wanted to add a third matter port tour second matter port tour and a third matter port twelve yeah do is add a new section then click external media and copy in the matter port link so I can go to this client and what's the total number of tours I can include I don't think there's a limit it's not gonna look good past a certain number of tabs so really three or four yeah I wouldn't go past past that it'll start looking full okay and so I just added a second matter port this is you know a different property so it doesn't quite make sense but there you go you can do that if you want so the player can have video photos virtual tour google map I'm trying to visualize maybe if we go back to your just me for a moment is go back to your examples page Joe and tor.com the examples page and then maybe if we go down to the player that's there yeah oh that's where we so there's west west side room Crestwood room valentine room so that's where we were talking about maybe three or four could fit nicely so in this example those three tabs are matter poor tours but one could be matter poor another tab could be the video and another tab could be Google Maps yep exactly or conceivably add a fourth tab that might be Google Maps Oh or photos so I might have photo video Google Maps tour all as tabs within one player exactly now if you do add a bunch of tabs this does become scrollable so yeah you can add as much as you want I suggest very forest optimal but we give you the freedom to test it out okay cool [Music] so you want to show you and I would like to see agents to how you create an agent let me start with the custom dominium so if you click on the project settings this is where we looked at before you can just type in whatever you want if you just want to change the extension but I actually just purchased this domain name from Namecheap so in the backend dns settings all you got to do is add a cname record well we went a little bit fast for me how did I get to this screen this is nature so I'm in in GoDaddy or whatever wherever I want to get my domain you have to be Namecheap in the backend of how you might add a cname record and what the settings look like we do have a help article that gives you the exact settings but basically right before this video I purchased this domain name I changed the cname to point to our hosting the host theme for show and tour the default setting you talked about this earlier is show dot tours I just area'd there I'm not sure I understand that well this is just the value to change the DNS settings for specific domain name to point to our system so that you can add a custom domain name to your project so is gonna be the the cname well so some and again we have a pal part this part is a little technical but we have a help article that steps you through it just tell you what settings to add maybe we can have you back and we'll just do a focus on see names and a records and how did how to do those settings that might be topic if you're up for it so I've added the cname I'm gonna go to this domain name real fast and so if I go to 45 24 Terrace comm just in it since this is the brand new domain name that I disconnected it's just gonna show this screen and it shows that it has not been registered yet but that does tell me that this domain name has been correctly that cname has been correctly added so now that I'm in my project I can actually just add that domain name in this field it tells me it requires setup this is where you can read our help article and add those settings here if you need I'm just gonna click complete domain set and on the back in here it's you know doing all the necessary things to actually put this project on this domain you save those changes so now we actually have this whole project on 45:24 terrace comm we've got the player little the deliverables page and the property website right here awesome do you mind going back to cheap names calm I'm just curious to see where that four or five where you were changing this the this this this the cname yeah so if every registrar is gonna be different on how you access yeah I I you happen to use GoDaddy I'm just curious on namecheap.com where you did the appropriate change you have to point to show dot tours yeah so we're just in the advanced DNS tab after you click on a domain name and then you would add a cname record it's as simple as just clicking any record you know cname and then typing in Unitas yes I I don't see where you've typed it you Oh you typed it it that's what this hosting that show dot tours dot and it accepted that and you're done exactly it was that actually it's that fast exactly yeah okay great okay so if you can exit here that's great you showed us how to do a custom property website URL was there anything else on that oh I see password protection that's interesting talk about that for about show and tour password protection please so you can password protect any one of these pages basically I'm actually the media player we don't have password protected but you can't password to protect a property website or delivery page basically you just enable that it's gonna generate it a random password you can change this to be whatever you want but what that being password protected I'm going to publish this jump over to this website hopefully it loads what were you thinking of the examples of where password password protection would be helpful useful or requested by um it so I actually have a client that recently requested password protection because they have a virtual tour that they only want specific clients to have access to so it's a private basically allows you to make anything private I there's not a ton of times that I personally use the best for protection but there's also situations where you have a home that's being listed but not on MLS and so that agent actually wants that listing to just be private and to you know to certain people because you know maybe that home has it's a pocket listing it's a five million dollar home in the helicopter in the backyard and it's not meant to be shown to everybody just first select few you know so there's a couple use cases right there okay I'd like to see that house with the helicopter please yeah but other other use cases for the password protection yeah you know there's probably a lot just anytime someone wants to have something private and they don't want it publicly available okay so how about I took you off screen share how about taking us back to screen share showing us how to create an agent yep I can see your screen yeah perfect so when creating a new client all you gotta do is click new client we can create you hopefully I spelled your name right there yes okay I'll create Dan as a client and so when you create that client this is the screen that allows you to decide well let's do it a little bit phone number 404 charm 303 731 one email is Dan Smeg fraud at we get around network.com we get around network.com web site is WWE n forum w w GaN forum comm WGN forum calm okay great so that's those are the basics there I just saved them but you can also you know you can add all your social media and then branding stuff too so maybe this is WGN you know these two settings are things that are going to be coming in the future and then this is where you can upload a profile picture and your company logo okay that works today the branding color is a coming soon feature and client bio is that the same yeah those are both things that are coming soon that they will be implemented I don't see anywhere that can be this can be saved I up here I click Save Changes so you save changes already okay great so now that's all it is to create a client and then while you're creating the deliverable you're just selecting the client associated with with that project right there okay great there was some I think's in the top right some settings you wanted to show us yeah let me quickly show you a client that already has projects in there so I'll just click on my first client here so when you do have projects under a client they will they will show up to the right now the last thing up here are your profile settings this is where you add your company information your different logos so we have allow you to upload a logo for a light background or dark background and then we've got your email template excuse me I'm confused okay so the logo that just happens to be your nomenclature you have so many things in there Sherpa media logo long no BG great xpx - long 2019 version dot PNG okay that's great I I'm all for that in terms of being super organized and I know your digital asset so I'm laughing but I'm I'm totally with you there Josh very exciting glad to see how meticulous you are in your organizing of your file names okay so that so let's see what else is on here branding company name [Music] website bio the email templates ah so when so you could be adding there's just one template is that correct you know this allows you to edit that default template that pops up that allows you to you know input different attributes such as you know client name here project linked here did I follow this correctly this is where you would globally change the email template but for specific client you could also change the email template for that particular project so yes yep this is the global default this is what you your starting point and then you can edit from there right before you said okay great this is also where you can choose your default domain name and your dashboard URL the default domain name is going to be the domain name that every project is built on so I've selected KC tours these are all the different domain names that I've added to our system so I've got a lot but I just have KC two are selected and so that basically just means every project do you own stock and cheap Mediacom what is it do you own stock and pin cheap media.com here you're sending them a lot of business name chief yeah I wish so if I just create a quick project here you'll see that it automatically gets created on KC tours so that's what that yeah that setting does okay cool and so then the dashboard URL same thing that's how I add at the admin Sherpa Mediacom we've got that's our branding tab we've done an account tab this is where you can you know change a couple settings your email password your name language currency go back if you would go back to currency for a moment do you have other currencies we do have a lot so we have more currencies than we do languages us we support so okay anything any anything you need okay so for Canadian as well Canadian dollar rose yeah that's basically just gonna change the symbol that shows up wherever there's a currency symbol yes okay this integrations tab is where you would connect to your QuickBooks or stripe account so you can see I've already added my yeah I love this Josh congratulations I'm sure that was a lot of work to get the integration of stripe and QuickBooks so you know we should take a moment celebrate your developer there because what you've just made is something super easy super fast super simple to be able to either create the invoice in show-and-tell or to pull an invoice from QuickBooks to have it go one way or the other way and it took you about two seconds that demoed that particular feature and so it was so easy for you to demo I think we we kind of lose that oh my gosh I used to have to create that individual invoice in a separate solution and then and then well you know thank heavens QuickBooks came around then then be able to put it in QuickBooks yeah but the two systems didn't tie together so you you literally have as you're creating the the project and billing it out it's now seamlessly passing to billing which ties back to your you know badly said but ties back to here's your pay button so and and your magic is stripe in in in quipped QuickBooks if for any of our viewers that are not familiar with stripe or for QuickBooks these are two really super tools ask your questions in the we get around Network forum about stripe or about QuickBooks there'll be a ton of members be happy to answer your questions on on either of those we get around network happens you use both stripe and QuickBooks QuickBooks Online ok that that's that's it that's yeah I you know we really should celebrate that that is something that probably took you all a long time to do annexation definitely one of our biggest achievements I would say Brian my team yeah and I and I you know I you know this I'll call it simple integration not I know that there's like probably months of work that to get this but this simple integration you know is one of those powerful features of showing tor is not only you know it's part of this whole Swiss Army knife thing that we were talking about at the top of the show which is the ability to deliver the digital assets and get paid for the digital assets and and to have the invoice show that it's been paid or it hasn't been paid or whether you're releasing the assets to this particular client or not releasing it it's this this integration is just super super important so anyway congratulations on that and sandfish it that yeah and we are I'm gonna add more integrations in the future so we know not everyone uses these systems but that was I think it's a good start the last tab is our subscription settings this is where you can change your subscription plan manage your payment method and it shows you the storage that you've used so you can see I've used about 50 gigabytes I've got a lot of projects on here and I'll discuss the pricing and storage and how that works yeah before we talk about show and tour pricing with were there any other features that you wanted to show us yes so we have a brand new feature that's not live yet it's in beta we want to push it out really soon but this is something we're really excited about for virtual tour providers okay I've taken you out screen share maybe you can go back into media let me get it set up real fast okay on the back end here so just give me one okay what you're about to show us is this been shown anywhere else before it is not okay world premiere WGA and TV live at five that's right okay so I'm gonna go ahead and share my screen so pretty soon we're going to introduce the concept of skins and so we've got websites we've got the player and now we're gonna have skins so the skin is going to be it lets you customize the look and feel of an individual virtual tour brand it to your own business and put it on your own domain name so you know we see the matter port for example the matter port plague when it's embedded on a website we see it you know it says powered by matter port I think that should say created by you your photography company with a link to your website and so that's what we've done I'm gonna go ahead and for this example just create a new project put it under you this time so to add to implement this new feature it's gonna show just like external media that's gonna pop up let me copy in our matter port link again copy it in just like we've been doing and now we have a brand new skin that you that is fully customizable and so this is similar to what it would show with a matter port virtual tour but now it says your company at the bottom this is a link to your website and then we've got different settings that you can just quickly change this is again in beta so not everything's working yet and there's some tweaks to finalize and what we're excited to get this out basically this is the front page before we then get into we still see the matter port branding in the bottom right corner but at least the front page static image if that's what's being seen on the page is the photographer's branding that matter ports branding exactly so this allows you let me just click Next here you're going to be able to capture statistics and and change it to your own domain name so this matter port link again the other exciting part is password protecting an individual tor this if I click done this tour now on the deliverables page well I actually have to publish it first birthday showed up so this tour is actually now hosted on my own domain name so I no longer need to deliver a matter port link I can deliver it at KC tours link to the matter port tour and so this is what would actually show up on the clients website embedded on their page we've got the embed code we've got the direct link and then they explore 3d space so we need to do some clarification on all these URLs so if if we go back for a moment to and maybe it's an examples page can can you take us back can you leave it maybe leave this page up and switch tabs go back to show and tour show and to show and tour and go back to the examples page and we're going to go into one of the players into one of the players and so here's where I'm confused so if we were sharing this particular tour using the show and tour share link in the bottom right within the black bar that's going to be the photographer's URLs in this case you as a photographer KC dot tours forward slash name of the tour let's close that for a second if I use the matter port link to share within the tour itself now that's going to be in my matter port link so now help me understand what's about to change regarding that second link the my matter port link let me show you an existing delivery page well this one's locked this one so with the existing delivery page when you're delivering this to or to a client it's going to be the matter port link this is that individual tour ah that's what's going to change so now with what's in development by show and tour is to be able to liver the matter port tour with a with your own domain name customize with your own branding so basically instead of saying powered by my report it's going to say by your company with a link to your website and then you know on your own domain name so and then this domain name we're gonna make it to where you can make it whatever you want just like everything else in our system so it's just another way to brand yourself with your content get link to your website so so Josh if we use that media URL that cut the first one the custom branded name and we were to launch that particular tours that possible are you able to show us that yeah so just for clarification in the top left corner there's that customization but if you go play the tour right now in the bottom right corner is still the matter port link in the bottom right of this particular tour so if we go to the bottom right not of your player but of matter port and we click on that to share that's still going to be the my matter port so you're still totally compliant with matter port terms and conditions etc but at least when the tour gets and incidentally obviously in that bottom right you could turn if I if I would turn off sharing right there so that the my matter port link can't be shared but the show and tour player can be shared and when the show and Tour players shared it's actually the photographer's custom domain yes absolutely so you get there right yes yeah if full control over how the tour gets displayed you can make it whatever you want just like you can you know custom a customized a matter port however you need but just it's really powerful to be able to deliver your own branded links and display that on clients websites that you know show your branding okay is this gonna help me with SEO as well absolutely because it has that link to your website you know it's gonna you tell any any website that displays this is gonna be linking to your website let me just do a little clarification there so if you happen to be a matter port service provider and let's say over the course of a year you've done a hundred tours and each of those hundred tours gets 500 views 500 times a hundred is fifty thousand page views that 50 thousand page views counts and organic search pointing back to your domain rather than pointing to matter ports domain that my might matter port to me so this is really super important in in terms of you know you can you can pay to move yourself up in search a lot of money or totally included with what's coming was showing tour is this using your domain it's not hosting I don't I don't to be misleading here it's not you're not hosting the matter port tour but it is the your own URL that's pointing to the matter port tour and by accomplishing that you get this benefit of organic SEO in that example of hundred tours five hundred page views fifty thousand page views is all counting towards your organic search to move you to move you up in search yeah absolutely and then it just gives you control over how you display your content so just more control to a photographer yes which is in another so when somebody you know wants to go oh hey see tours let me see what that company is okay that's gonna take me to the photographer's websites not going to take me oh that's mater poor speck indignant a matter for its websites gonna take me the photographer's website okay cool what else you got coming in development that you can talk about that's the big one we've got more coming that's what I want to share today is this new we're calling the skin it allows you to skin any video or virtual tour and brand it to your own business there's a lot of things in the back end to make this work and then the cool part is again we're gonna be able to continue to change the backend settings that allow you to customize that tour with the click of a button so you're not messing with I've showed you some of that with our current system this new system will continue to take that to another level you can change your SEO title description you know this is just the start of just more things that are gonna be able to give you greater control over your content mm-hmm you got a couple more buttons off off to the left there rocketship yeah so that rocks ships that last tab so we've got the first tab that where you inputted your link then we got some settings and then we've got this is the publish tab where you can choose your URL you can choose to use the matter port link if you wanted to and then this is allows you to password protect that individual tour as well so that's a cool function awesome before we talk about pricing anything else you got coming you want to talk about we've got the agent editing that's coming really soon integrations with more systems is coming soon and then you just got a sign up for a free account or a paid account and you'll stay updated fake it's the pricing let's go to your pricing page share your screen take take us to show and tour calm let's bend click on the link pricing so everybody knows how we got there yep sharing now so I'm back on show and tour calm you just got a click pricing it's going to scroll down to the bottom and so these are about three four plants if you sign up you start on the free plant our system is based on storage and I mentioned it before we give you freedom to create whatever you want within that capacity so the free plan includes one gigabyte of storage and on average our users are creating about five projects on there for free once you upgrade to the Plus plan which now has 10 gigabytes of storage which is equivalent to about 50 projects you can also then connect remember minions connect with strike a QuickBooks and implement the pay to download feature I'm confused if I want to connect my own domain names from day one and connect to stripe in QuickBooks and to have this pay to download I can skip free go immediately to the plot that I can skip the starter plan that's free go straight to the plus plan it's $19 a month and have the full feature set absolutely yeah the plus and the pro have the same feature sets the difference is in storage and so that pro plan that's made for that you know that full-time business owner that's you know doing projects daily and don't don't want to have to worry about the backend storage limits and so that includes a terabyte or a thousand gigabytes and on average that's about 5,000 projects so it's gonna you're gonna be able use that for a while okay let's take us through each of the delivery items again of what's included please absolutely so you have unlimited project delivery pages unlimited property websites unlimited media players coming soon unlimited skins you know you can create unlimited clients you can add your own custom logo and branding that's the links to your website that's that logo that's displayed you know on every page and then with the paid plans you can connect your own domain name any domain name you want multiple domain names no limits on that either you can connect with stripe and QuickBooks to create invoices sync between those systems and then lastly lastly you can implement the pay to download feature so you can ensure you get paid on time great and so the full feature set is in both the plus plan and the pro plan the only thing is the difference is if you're doing about 50 projects or if you're beyond 50 projects yeah okay terrific and then
