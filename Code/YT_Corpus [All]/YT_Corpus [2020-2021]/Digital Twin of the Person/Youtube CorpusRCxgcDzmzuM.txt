 this is the harley davidson ultra limited and  it's the top of the range of the harley-davidson   touring models apart from obviously the cvo the  custom vehicle operations ones but this is the top   of the range and in this video we're going to give  a full and thorough review now i've been riding   this bike around for a couple of days i've given  it motorway riding dual carriageways country lanes   towns you name it i've ridden it so i can give  you a good evaluation of what this bike's to ride   as a touring bike so with a bike like this it's  inherently important that it's comfortable for   the pillion rider and i can confirm that that  is the case it's very comfortable place to be on   and we've just gone for a nice  long ride just to test out how   nice it is and it's really really comfortable if  you compare it to a lower range sort of soft tail   on the heritage classic which i've been on the  back of quite a lot it's a lot more comfortable   and you can sit back more because you've got this  nice back pad it's like being in an armchair and   that really does enhance your experience because  when you're having to hug a person in front of   you your head's right up against the back of their  helmet and you notice you knock into them and they   accelerate whereas you don't have to worry about  that with this fight which is really really good as always there's something getting in the  way of our audio so we've got gale force wins   as usual and there's a tractor down the  road cutting the hedges on all the fields   so i'm sure he's going to be doing that all day so  apologies for that but we haven't got much choice   this has the twin cooled 114 cubic inch engine  and it produces 164 newton meters of torque   at 3000 rpm but you feel the torque  all the way through the rev wrench   and it's a very easy low revving bike that  pulls up hills and overtakes effortlessly   it produces 89 horsepower which is 66 kilowatts at  5020 rpm so it's not massively powerful but bikes   like this are all about the torque a crucial  thing with a vial like this is luggage space   and this rear box has got a lot of space in it  um it's got really nice handle as well actually   but yeah opening this up you can fit two helmets  here like so so if you've got two riders and   you're going out for the day you don't have to  worry about where you're putting your helmet   or taking it around with you you pop them in the  back closes really nice and easily you'll probably   a few other bits in there as well with them  in there so that's very very good now before   we made this video i put in the community section  of our youtube page basically some questions that   people would like to ask about the bike so i'll  go over those a little bit later in the video this has a seat height of 740 millimeters  the footboards are a little closer to you   than they are on the street glide special which  is also the same sort of chassis touring model   as this so it's a little less stretched out and  also compared to the heritage classic touring bike   it's a little less roomy if you're a tall guy so  i'd say the perfect height for this bike would be   about six foot five for eleven and above and below  that obviously the further away you get from that   ideal height um the slightly worse it will be for  you um but as i said we've got a pull back on the   handlebars and the closer board so you're a little  bit more upright than you are on some of the other   models in this backtop box here you've also got  a 12 volt socket which will come in really handy   if you've got an electric tire pump or anything  else that will fit in there so i mean if you're   going camping which you probably could be doing  with this bike you could plug in your mattress   pump so something like that you know they've got  plenty of options for that that's really handy   it weighs 400 416 kilograms with all its fuel  and oils and things which is tremendously heavy   and you feel that weight very much when you're  maneuvering this bike about shunting about in a   car park trying to push it backwards you  really do feel the weight and it would   benefit certainly from a reverse gear like you  have on the trike or the bmw r18 for instance   once you're going however it's perfectly fine  and it feels uh very well balanced and very   nice to ride it's not until you have to make a  sudden change of direction or movement to get   out of the way of an oncoming car or something  that you again feel that a bit of extra weight   with the side panniers you've got  plenty more luggage space as well there   and they're nice and easy to open and you can  fit loads in there i mean that's really good for   to be going away for a while and also you could  put stuff on this top rack here so you could   strap stuff on with a bungee or a rope and you  can fit quite a bit more on top of there as well the rake which is the angle of the steering  head is quite steep it's 26 degrees   and the trail is 170 millimeters and  the wheelbase is 1 625 millimeters   so those dimensions give you a stable ride  but because of the steepness of the forks   it gives you quick steering so you kind of get the  best of both worlds but it's not quite as stable   i'd say as the soft tails which mostly have 30  degree rakes or the breakout which has 34 i think   that's more stable so this is a little bit easier  to turn than those so basically i'm going to run   through the boom gts infotainment system there's  bytes equipment so you've got radio fm mw and l lw   is it radio not uh it's not got dab and you've got  voice recognition so if you've got a boom audio intercom or you can get a boom audio helmet which  has that already in it from harley you can connect   it to your bike connect it to the passenger rider  you can also talk to other people who've got them   if you're riding in a group so you've also got  this bike you've got four speakers you've got   two up the front and you've got two either one  either side of the passenger and this spike's   got hands-free mobile so if you've got your  intercom your headset if anyone gives you a ring   you can speak to them on your headset through the  system and that's very nice and easy to do you've   also got an sd card flash drive and you've got mp3  so you can plug your usb and mp3 if you've got a   usb drive put some songs on there plug it in  you can also connect your phone to this bike   via bluetooth and that way you can use the text  to speak feature so if someone sends you a text   the bike will read it out for you so  you don't have to worry about stopping   stopping inside of the road and reading your phone  you can carry on riding and the bike will read it   for you so that's really good you've also got  two sockets you've got one at the front here   and you've got one on the left side of the back  pad that's for your intercom if you haven't got   a bluetooth one and you've also got two two little  switches here so you've got a volume up and down   for the rear rider if you've got your headset  plugged in and you've got a mode switch as well   so that's a nice little thing to have you also  have 18 inch wheels on this and riding along   i would say it feels more confidence inspiring  at speed for sustained periods of time than the   street glide special which we rode a week  ago but the dimensions are pretty much the   same the chassis is the same and everything  seems the same but then it feels different   um the difference perhaps is that you've  got a fatter taller front tire than   the other model and that isn't a low profile tyre  so that gives you a little bit more pliability   with the road surface and with the fairing  what have you it just it does feel very stable   and confidence inspiring at speed so if you're  bowling down the motorway for long periods of time   i felt that i could just open it up and go a lot  faster and felt perfectly happy to be able to do   that so it is a nice bike to ride at speed once  you get off the motorway or the freeway and get   into the country lanes and the windy stuff  this bike does uh take the bends very well   and it's easy to steer um less stably so  in the corners than the soft tails i'd say   so it's got a quick steering tendency but it feels  perfectly fine it comes as standard with heated   grips this is a really nice feature in the winter  if you've ridden without them you know that when   you get to your destination you're ridden for more  than 10 minutes your hands are frozen and you can   barely even pick up a pen um you've got a dial  on the left bar end with six different settings   and each one's going to be increasingly  warm so that's a nice little feature to have   you have a 22.7 liter fuel tank which gives  you 37 miles per gallon which is about 184 mile   range on those figures in the real world you're  probably likely to get a little less than that   now we've got a helicopter going over here  and still got careful sprints tractor going   past and they're cutting the hedges we can't win  the harley davidson ultra limited starts at 24   695 pounds in black this is a  two-tone color which costs 27 085   this has got black and river rock grey which is  a lovely color we really really like this color you have a very comfortable soft wide seat on this  and a huge rear passenger seat with a backrest   as a rider with a passenger on the back you  don't really feel the passenger as much as you   do on most motorcycles to be honest and it's  probably the best riding experience i've had   with a passenger of any bike so that's a very  good thing and darcy will tell you what it's   like obviously as a as a pillion passenger  too now this has the typical clunky six-gear   harley-davidson gearbox there's nothing wrong  with that but you do feel the gears as they go in   they're not the smoothest gearboxes but they work  perfectly well and that's just what they're like   the ultra limited's got a two into one into two  exhaust and um as standard it doesn't sound great   as of all exhausts it sounds all right it's  got a nice rumble to it but there's loads of   options for exhaust for this bike you've got  the screaming eagle range you can get slip-ons   you could get a full system there's hundreds of  different options for exhaust as of any harley so   that's not really anything you want to  worry about as standard the mirrors on   this are very good they're the same mirrors  as on the heritage classic they look lovely   i could see at least half of the road behind me  not all of it so if they were a little higher   and wider that would be perfect but it depends  on your height so if i was a bit shorter i'd   probably see a lot more of the row behind  me than i do being my height the fairing is   very good on this it keeps the wind off your body  ever so nicely and you've got a nice high screen   so it's only the top of your head and your helmet  that gets a bit of the air just enough to get some   air into your helmet to keep it ventilated and  stop you steaming up the display on the top you've   got analog dials which i love you've got a fuel  gauge you've got the speedometer the rev counter   and a voltmeter and a little digital display  as well to show you the various things you can   uh scroll through from the handlebar as usual in  fact it's the top of the handlebar on this one   it's got a gear indicator which shows you which  gear in which is very hard to see because it's   too small um also you've got this sort of  little kind of radiator shroud here which   take the wind off your legs and there's a little  lever here which you can slide along and open up   a little vent to get some air into your legs  or into the engine if it's very hot the brakes   are very good you've got a linked brake system so  if you pull the front it works a bit of the rear   and vice versa you've got double discs up front  and single at the rear so stopping power is very   good not the best in the world because it's  such a heavy bike but it's more than adequate   the side stand is absolutely dreadful when you  put the stand out you push it as far as it will   go you lean the bike onto it and you get off as  you get off it moves towards about three or four   inches and you think you're gonna drop the bike  every single time uh so if it's on a slight minute   slope it will do that which is very disconcerting  with such a heavy bike and if you do drop a bike   like this and you try and save it the chances are  you're going to end up on the floor with the bike   so subscribers questions first of all tire  pressure monitoring system um it's optional in   the usa but standard everywhere else i believe  the range we've already covered but the range   with a trailer or side car obviously that's  going to be less because of the extra weight   the size for tall guys six foot the perfect height  i'm six foot three it's still okay any taller than   that you're going to find it a little bit cramped  any shorter than that and you might struggle too   cornering much more nimble in the corners  than you'd expect for such a big heavy bike   engine compared to the bmw r18 both comparing  standard engines with standard engines and pipes   the r18 feels like it's got more grunt  and it feels more powerful and smoother   take a different pipe on either bike they're  going to sound lovely but they both sound   subdued in standard form um the r18 has got  that sort of pull to the left when you blip   the throttle not all the time only on blips this  obviously doesn't so that's better in that respect   wind protection and buffeting the fairing is very  good it takes the wind off your body nicely as   does this thing with the the wind on your legs um  it's got a bit of a vent here to let air through   and you can open up the vents here too buffeting  a little bit on the top of your helmet i wouldn't   perhaps say buffeting but as in you can feel the  wind but you need a bit of wind in your helmet   to keep the circulation of air anyway so our  verdict on the harley-davidson ultra limited   is that it is a very capable touring motorcycle  it's superb on the motorway and for sustained   high-speed riding it's very nimble in the  corners um it's superb for two-up riding as well   make sure you check out our t-shirts they're  in the carousel below there's loads of unique   designs designed in-house by us and you know go  on there have a
