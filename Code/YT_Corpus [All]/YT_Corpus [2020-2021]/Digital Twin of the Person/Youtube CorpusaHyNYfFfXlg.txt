 can we build a real-life time machine that is the question I asked myself two years ago and the answer is hell yep for the past two years I've been working on the real-life time machine and I know that right now we have lots of questions such as who's that guy why does he have a box on his face and also how now the truth is is that we can't build a time machine that lets you go back in time and kill Hitler I I tried that that's that's very hard what we can do is build a personal time machine a virtual reality invention that lets you go back in time to re-experience your memories from the past and the way we're gonna do it is simple for one year I will wear a camera on my face recording my life day in and day out for 365 days and then using the power of virtual reality will create an immersive time machine simulation that lets me go back to any date that I want to see through younger eyes again today we're gonna build this project together as I do my best not to completely lose my mind welcome to Lukas builds the future but the face camera is not gonna look like that that's that's a stupidest idea okay so before building the time machine I needed to figure out a way to record my life from my perspective so I sat down and hack together my own face camera solution and to put it simply it sucked giant gorilla didn't it was ugly heavy and uncomfortable and after a little bit of testing on tinder it became clear that I was about to spend one year without getting laid that's that's not good it's gonna be like 2012 when I spent one year trying to get laid with a Minecraft box for a head and you just you just can't come back from that so in a desperate attempt to save my love life I searched the internet for another solution and went on the googles then I hacked the Japanese military and retrieved blueprints for an experimental project known as Project X then I just went to this website and bought some camera glasses they're called a specter spectacles these are camera glasses created by snapchat and using them super simple you just press this button and it starts recording there are two cameras recording at twelve sixteen by twelve sixteen pixels in 60 frames a second but the cool thing is because these are two cameras these are actually recording in stereoscopic 3d which is going to look super cool in virtual reality so yeah I was really excited about spectacles but they also had some problems holy [ __ ] this was not scripted this was not scripted at all yeah the spectacles had some limitations but we were just gonna move forward and do our gosh darn best to record as much of my life as I could speaking of which how much harddrive space is a year's worth of memories going to be well I wasn't really sure so I just bought myself three hard drives just to be safe problem solved or so I thought but what matters is that we now have a plan and it's finally time to start recording my life so I packed my bags bought myself some plane tickets and started a one-year trip around the world [Music] [Applause] so as you can see 2019 was a very uneventful year now while I have spent an entire year recording my life just for the sake of transparency I have to say that not all of these clips actually happen to me and of course I'm referring to the guitar clip that was actually my friend Aiden wearing his glasses everything else is pretty much good so now that we were done with the capturing stage of the project it was time to start working on a time machine and just as 2020 was rolling around that's when I realized I was way over my head I had never worked with this much data before and building the time machine was gonna test every single one of my skills cuz really the time machine was divided into three distinct parts or trials if you will the control panel the memory finder and the time travel effects and let me tell you man trial number two terrified me it was by far the most complicated and difficult trial of them all and I had no idea of where to even begin solving it and if I didn't figure out a way not only the whole project would collapse but the entire past year would have been a complete waste of time all right now that we have that out of the way let's get started with the time machine starting with trial number one the control panel so this is what its gonna look like oh oh pretty cool right I did it myself there's gonna be some buttons that let you select the destination date a panel just like you know Back to the Future and a big phallic start lever that you pull down to get the whole thing started I I swear to you I'm doing my best to keep this family friendly and just to keep things exciting we're gonna build this whole thing in 60 seconds we're gonna do it all it's 60 60 seconds oh [ __ ] we don't want this boys and girls alright let's go build this thing we got 60 seconds on the clock 60 seconds you ready three two one 5% a new unity project that created all these cubes and I move around slipping some text and look is the time panel from Back to the Future all right now let's go write some code this is this is really good code just trust me all right and look at that the panel it's working I can change the date I can change anything just like that it's the masterpiece hold up a minute oh god damn there's there's no 60 second of March this is bad code I gotta I gotta go fix it good go fix the code all right let's go test it again and and it's still broken you know what that's good enough for me let's just go let's just move on this it's time for buttons baby all right this part goes over here and this part goes over there Nazis are bad animate that gotta clean my room write some code so you can press the button with your hand and now it's time to test it it's time to test the button so stop the music I said stop the music I said stop we're gonna do some testing and we have to do this right okay we can't rush this testing is it's very important so we're gonna do this right we're gonna do this we're gonna do this right so to properly test our buttons we're gonna need the help of Brad Brad is a pretty nice guy with only one passion in life touching things so let's watch him touch my button and as it turns out it also works with a human head and also a cow and also a penis and that is how you test the button make 5 copies of the button doesn't make him colourful like in the drawing make a small effort make a stick lever stitch it all together with code and buh-bam so easy Wow done it's it's really as simple as that this just looks great simple as that I mean look at it look at this this is this is truly amazing yes it looks exactly like it did in the sketch except I said it doesn't look like he was drawn by a freaking toddler we got the time pan oh we got the colourful buttons we got the thick lever but by trial number one cuz we're finished with you fool it appeared we were finally finished but then I had an epiphany I realized that if I was done with the first trial it meant that I had to start working on the memory finder the actual important part of the project my mind was racing what if I can get it to work but if I'm not good enough what if this whole video was a mistake it was grown a virus an inside job what the hell is that thing but then I calmed myself down I took in a long deep breath and I did the only thing I could do trial number three hashtag procrastination hashtag [ __ ] you try number two okay back to business so let's say that we just used our time machine we put in a date we pull down the lever and now we see a memory playing right there in front of us what should that look like now we can just have the video play as is but that that will be lame this this is a time machine guys it should look freaking cool so in this part of the video we're gonna use our imagination and spice up our memories with some time-travel effects so let me give you an example remember that memory pool thingy and Harry Potter hat that thing looks fine so imagine if that's how we visualized our memories inside of some sort of mystical bowl full of magical water pretty cool if you ask me or maybe it's something like Minority Report I mean get a load of that memory projector I mean it has this cool analogue edge to it and all these imperfect 3d features this can be pretty rad now it's important to remember that we're building this in virtual reality we're not constrained by the laws of physics we can build anything what to make our memories come out of a gigantic version of Brad's ass [Music] I'm not saying it's a good idea but you could with the are the only limit is your imagination and that's too bad because I have no imagination at all I tried to recreate the things from these two movies and I failed beyond belief like this is my Harry Potter memory ball Lucas what the [ __ ] and then I try to do the Minority Report thing and that was the result I mean what a piece of crap and just like that things were not good at the time was passing me by and I was running out of movies to steal from out of ideas I had no choice but to take a break in play some good old portal to alright let's do this this next test is very dangerous to help you remain tranquil in the face of almost certain death smooth jazz oh oh I love this game oh man if only I had a simple way to create a window into another reality something simple and circular hold up a minute hold up a minute he turned off the smooth jazz what an ass also I'm gonna do portals so let's build this thing so the first thing we're gonna do is write some portal code this is gonna be the spine of our weird new VR baby it has to do three things open and close the portal play whatever memory we want and control any visual effects the portal may have little hacking here a little hacking there and the groundwork was set now it was time to make her memories pretty I use unity shadowgraph to create a portal shader a small program that cuts out the black parts of the videos and adds a sprite edge around their memory and things were going pretty well that's until I try to make it work with 3d video and oh my god what a pain in the ass it took me two days to get it right and every time I got it wrong there was a trip to Nadja town but not right now that's that's just a beer eventually I got it done and now it was time for some real polish I one of the portal to look like it was being projected from the time machine so I created a fading triangle in Photoshop and used to build a rotating particle system the results were pretty sweet for the finishing touches I created simple open and close animations added a subtle ripple effect to our portal as well as fill the scene with lights and sound effects to really sell the illusion after tying all of those parts together with the code from the beginning ladies and gentlemen we had our portal [Music] [Applause] [Applause] yeah I was really happy with how this turned out and then ended up being this interesting combination of all the ideas we talked about the portal had these water like features and sounds like in Harry Potter it is being projected like in Minority Report and it's also a portal like in portal which goes to show that when we're building our own things we can borrow little bits from many different ideas to create something new and original so after was done polishing the portal I took that and I brought it back to the time machine that we built and I stitch them together so now the time machine could activate the portal and the portal could be activated by the time machine and yeah I think we're finally done with this part no no no no no no no we're not doing that yet we still have some other things to do no you see we can't we can't work on the memory finder yet because there's there's just so much stuff that we still have to do I mean look at our environment it's it's it's so boring let me spice it up let me add these nostalgic objects from the 80s I mean look at it it looks better already okay not good enough for you I guess how about reactors I mean the power of the time machine needs to be coming from somewhere right so I'm gonna add all these reactors how about the giant set of amps and the sound of the memory is gonna come from them okay hear me out Windows Phone support and a dog everything is better with the dog there's too many features how about we do everything again except orange I'm gonna kidnap my neighbor how about a version you can use as a yoga that make it stop I'm going to start they can't stop and that was today I quit the project now I know that you're confused after all everything was going so well what could possibly be so hard about the memory finder but there's something I must confess the memory finder wasn't the last thing that I tried [Music] it was the first now I'm no dummy I knew that the memory finder was the most crucial part of the project so after recording my memories that's what I started with to make this work I was going to use something called metadata which is information about a file things like the file name size type or the date a file was created on that is what I was going to use in my memory finder that was the key to time travel but as I started building it I realized a terrible thing the metadata of all my memories was gone erased I didn't know when any of it happened now I'm not entirely sure at what went wrong apparently when you export your memories from the snapchat app the metadata just gets destroyed and I get it but it also meant that my years worth of footage was useless the project was doomed from the start now there's two things you can do in a situation like this number one you figure out a solution and number two you pivot the project and go do something else of course I chose option number three procrastination for weeks and weeks I just pretend that nothing was wrong and kept working on everything else the user interface the memory visualization and whenever the memory finder was up next on the list I would just make some dumb [ __ ] up and go to something else but eventually I ran out of excuses and at that point I just started to ignore the project entirely days went by than weeks than months then years okay okay not years it was actually three months but that's that's still alive at this point I was ready to give up the amount of emotional pressure was insurmountable and I was starting to resent the whole thing only one thing could save this project now and that was a leap of faith [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh okay I guess it was all in my head god dammit [Music] [Music] [Applause] oh [ __ ] okay let me take this down for a second so this is it we're finally at the point where I get to try out my baby I mean to see my baby for the first time so before I go into the time machine I would just like to say thank you thank you for sticking with me throughout this whole process thank you for being a part of my little world for these 20 minutes or so and if you could please like this video and subscribe to my channel it really helps me no but seriously I only have negative two subscribers please please please subscribe and because I don't know how long I'm gonna be here I brought a blanket and pillows because I don't know if we've got to spend all day here or maybe the rest of my life I mean I don't know how good this app is going to be it could be really good I'm gonna turn off these lights so we have a booty environment alright here goes nothing whoa dude hell yeah look at my hands so just for context I've been working from a 2d screen this whole time so this is the first time that I've seen all my stuff er the proportions of everything pretty much on please accept these tiny levers look at them so small that that was not intentional at all okay now let's get serious for a second and let's actually do this first so right now is April 15 20 2010 35 a.m. that's our current time that's the nation time right now is April 15th 2019 exactly one year ago so I don't have to do anything at us out to pull this lever and then we're good this is it [Music] here we go [Music] [Music] I'm on a tree eating a bagel it's really hard to describe the feeling you get reliving your own past it does to feel like watching a video not at all in fact the moment you see through your eyes again your brain lights up and you remember everything connected to that moment you don't just see the memory portal you see everything around it like the rush of memories you get when you smell food Eve's to eat as a child it's crazy overwhelming emotional and way more immersive than I thought it would be I was my own ghost watching myself wonder through life with no idea of what was gonna happen next [Music] but the most surprising thing about this project is how it made me realize how much of my life I had forgotten experiences have had friends that I made places I visited so many memories lost to darkness until I saw them a second time it made me wonder how much of our lives we just forget over the years and I didn't want that to happen I didn't want to forget anymore memories are after all parts of who we are and to forget something is to suffer a small death and if there's anything that's clear about the future now is that forgetting will be something of the past now I have to be honest with you I'm someone who's very hard on himself there's many days where I wake up and I don't like who I see in the mirror I don't like the way he talks the way he thinks the way he looks I don't like who that person is but watching myself from a distance has given me a new perspective it has let me appreciate myself as a separate person and using the time machine maybe realize that I liked the person I was watching sure he wasn't perfect but he was nice thoughtful and smart and it took me building a time machine to see all that to see my own self-worth now in many of my memories there are moments where I just start talking to my future self I ask myself how I'm doing I share what I'm feeling I reveal where I'm at and where I'm going and those moments didn't feel like memories they felt like gifts gifts made by a past version of myself delivered across time and upon receiving them all I wanted to do was to return the favor to shut down the time machine and go out into the world to create a future that's impossible to forget not for me but with me this time machine changed me in products like this will probably change you to one day and while there's a lot that you can say about the dangers of being stuck in your own past visiting it can give you wonders that lasts a lifetime thank you for watching see you in the future wow what an episode huh thank you so much for watching this until the end this is the first episode of a series that I want to do call Lukas builds the future and the idea is that on every single video I'm gonna be building something crazy using futuristic technology and what this means is that I'm taking project suggestions so if there's anything either from pop culture or your head they would like you to build that's what the comments section is for by the way these videos are done entirely with an iPhone and nothing else that in the help of my neighbor Sam who helped me do some of the camera work so yeah thank you for watching this all the way until the end I am working on episode 2 so that's gonna be not here in your door very soon hello [Music] is any is anyone there [Music] [Music] Oh God I guess a really dick in that my neighbor [Music] you
