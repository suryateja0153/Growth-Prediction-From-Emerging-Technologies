 Alright welcome back this is the Uptime Podcast this is episode 7 I'm your co-host Dan Blewett and I'm joined here remotely by lightning protection expert Allen Hall. Allen how you doing? Hey Dan good how are you? I'm doing great doing great a little more energy this week a lot of rain but it didn't deter me I got some good smells going on in my in my place at the moment got some pine trees scented wax melt or something so it smells like the outside that's been you haven't seen smells like the forest yes so doing all right doing all right how are you doing well you know we're just kind of quarantine mode then the governor extended our quarantine till May 18th so we thought we're going to get off out of this quarantine sometime next week I thought that was the original plan I think of May 4th or 5th was the original date so now we're out to May 18th and everybody's going stir-crazy Massachusetts has had a little bit of uptick in in coronavirus cases new cases so the issue is Massachusetts is a very long state and very narrower States and and Boston's near the water and we live on the far opposite in effect grow on the state line so when things happen in Boston what tends it happens the whole state ends up doing the same thing so Boston being the capital of Massachusetts decides that there's a there's a an issue in Boston for coronavirus so the whole state shuts down so we on the western part of the state are just kind of wondering what's going on and when we can kind of get back to work in fact today I thought I was just going to went from the office and thought well there's a lot of cars on the road today so I kind of wonder if people are starting to hit the streets again you see a lot of masks and all everybody's got a mask on and the grocery stores are full of masks you see people walking up and down the streets which you didn't see a week ago so people are starting to get out and about a little bit I think in our case it's it's pretty calm in this part of the state yeah well so what's your opinion so we're talking with us on one of my other podcasts the idea of you know business is opening back up and people are starting to get like you said more than just a rumbling but I mean some people are protesting obviously about you know we need to get to bed and we need to get back to work let us take on the risk whatever obviously I don't know why barbers have been like the highlighted ones I don't know why like if they seen a salon owner or like yeah yeah I get that like I have no issue with salons and barbershops opening up like small foot traffic you know I feel like that's yeah really not well if you're gonna slowly you know let some businesses reopen that seems yeah completely fine like we can't be in this forever right right we can't be in forever don't you worry more about being on a bus or being in a taxi you know I would to those those places don't make any sense to me I'm not going to a movie theater I'm not going to a concert but one on one and with interaction obviously is someone who's cuttin your hair is gonna be dealing with a lot of people from a lot of from the surrounding area typically you're not coming from too far away usually so we I think it's just sort of a where the risk is and whether it's worth the risk I think one on one everybody's doing really well I've seen a lot of hand washing I've seen a lot of masks I seen a lot of people not touching their face yeah so if you change their behavior and people's behaviors have changed and you know it becomes a lot less of a risk I think everybody so on higher alert still but it you don't you don't seem to me to walk up to you and say hello they they're six feet eight six to eight 10 feet away they stop and say hello okay yeah I think that's fine when you start to think about it like what are the odds of the one person that I go spend you know a minute with like if you're if you're just like stop a random stranger on the street right now and just like sit down have coffee with them like what are the odds that that one person has grown a virus you know what I mean like it's very low and especially in certain places it's a lot lower what's what's weird in DC right now they send out like if you follow mayor Bowser who I think is doing a really good job if you follow her Twitter account she tweets out every day the new cases like the overall breakdown of Ages of deaths of cases by ethnicity by age of all these different stats and unfortunate this is sad more than a half I think of the cases in DC are to african-americans and I think it's a lot because there's just a larger population some of the more impoverished areas and so the they also show a breakdown of the the 8dc wards so that you know DC is broken up into eight wards yeah and the four most low socio net socioeconomic status of wards have over fifty percent of the cases themselves so it's kinda it's concentrate in the in the poor areas which is sad and that's reflected in just in every bit of the stats and then so in my ward which I'm more in the center of DC like I'm you know a mile or two from the White House and there's a lot more industry there's a lot more business there's a lot more monuments a lot more green space and a little more expensive to live there that's crowded yeah there's only 350 cases in my ward and there's four four thousand and in DC right now I think something like that so it's it's really interesting the disparity like the three most expensive to live wards have a very low incidence compared to the overall you know like one Ward has as many as three wards combined um so it's really weird here in DC but you start to think about like again if like a high-end salon opens up in the middle of the city is that a big risk certainly not and just like some of these smaller shops but you know if you walk in and out of a grocery store there's a lot of risk but obviously we need groceries so it really is a complex time you know and are they gonna open public transportation there's a subway system in DC or they know that's been open all time and I've gone out yeah and I've been on it a bunch of times on the subway don't feel unsafe at all because I have a whole car to myself so taking the metro once in the last three weeks I think and even then it was the same thing like you walk in you swipe your card I literally don't touch a single thing I sit down put my hands in my lap there's no one in my car probably and then I get out the door ones for me I walk up the escalator swipe my card and I leave it's like it's almost like a touchless interaction and so oh yeah it's been running cuz I mean that's that's a lifeline in the city people need the the subway to go places but they do the same thing there you don't see the only people you really see taking the subway besides me occasionally is just lower on lower-income people unfortunately and so how's that how's the uber is the zubur still running do they have an uber and that's the thing it's like you take this subway bid on uber yeah cuz I'm not touching anything and I'm and I can control how far away I am from other people in the metro or I'm in their car like I'm I know I'm gonna be six feet from them in the backseat but I'm that distance from them no matter what whereas on the Metro I can position myself in the huge empty subway station and in a huge subway car to be as far away from another human as I want I feel like that's a relatively good choice well I would have thought of been completely the opposite I thought the the the subways would have been first I thought the subways were shut down but if they're not shut down they would still have a pretty decent amount of traffic on them where versus variable versus uber which is sort of a one-on-one so I've been like a hundred to one versus one to one your bets are probably better off one to one even if you're a little bit closer yeah which again that's I mean a lot being being logically consistent and exactly what I said before like what are the odds that your Hoover driver has it but the same time you know you start taking like socioeconomic status into it maybe you think more over drivers are likely to have it because they're driving around and you know rather than I don't know it's it's a it's a fascinating discussion do they have any do they have any idea about the taxi drivers uber drivers it doesn't matter guys drive in advance to the airport is there are there cases oh I'd be that well one of the things were exactly right because you're maybe touching different parts of the community whether those people are running around different parts of community or starting to pick up the virus or not Wow yeah well I think people it seems like and this is just kind of conjecture on my part but I think people in DC who have the means or just staying home they're not really going many places whereas I would guess that uber rides in the city are probably people that still need to go to work and so they're taking over to go to work which means they're working around other people right maybe out people were taking over more likely to be in contact with other people more likely to then to pick it up more likely than to give it to an uber driver who knows you know there's no again it's all conjecture but yeah it's sad that that I guess more that have-nots are getting it you never want to see that that's round no but just more densely populated and you know there's a large homeless population in DC when I leave my apartment go for a walk I'm gonna go for a run when we're done done filming tonight you know I'm gonna run past a bunch of groups of people that are just outside either just you know shooting the breeze with each other or they're you know just congregating just doing whatever or they're living outside there's a lot of tents in DC so you just know that when you live outside you're just gonna you're gonna be more risk because you shouldnt be around other people so it's it's tough there's a lot of interesting factors that are something really sad and it's just gone okay the whole thing is complicated it yeah it's really complicated I just hope that we're on the the down side of this or as we were told a month ago we needed to flatten the curb hopefully you guys are flattening the curve up here we're definitely on the downside or flat and we've been flattened for a week or born yeah I don't know I think I think cases are slowly increasing in DC I'm not super plugged into it I'm just gonna doing my thing but yeah it's again I don't people seem to be abiding it pretty well but I think the homeless population and and just like the poor population because there is a big divide depending on where you live and then you know DC times are very expensive yeah oh and uh I think there's just a bigger gap there than anywhere else so to think of the the where I live exactly in the city where are the what are the rates like there's minor still very very low fortunately so good so anyway but yeah it's an interesting lot of stuff going on so in the wind turbine industry we were just talking there was one major wind turbine damage that made a little bit in news so what was the story out in Cairo yeah down in southeast Kansas they had a either a high wind situation which I'm not sure that would be the right or a lightning issue where a blade just really got destroyed and hit the nacelle and did a bunch of damage so they're investigating down there to see what the issue is obviously they're gonna go back and take a look at the weather data to see if there was a lightning strike nearby and obvious it's gonna take them a while to figure out exactly what happened plus the the turbines out of operation and they got a bunch of cleanup to do and repairs to do so okay they got their hands full especially not with all the corona of our stuff now southeast Kansas is not the most populous place in the world it's the mecca of the world that's where the technology there's a loving starts and stops yeah there's a lot of good people down there independence Canada it's just independence Kansas it's just sort of north of Tulsa Oklahoma so you're kind of in that Oklahoma Kansas area and it's a neat area but it's not highly populated so getting people out to this place to get this winter band fixed is gonna be probably a big effort oh boy yeah and what you said in this there's probably is no timetable for that right no no right yeah I think the first thing is to figure out what happened and then get everything to disassemble get another blade out there if they're gonna repair it get another blade out there get install and get them to self fixed up and it's just like any sort of significant aircraft incident where you have a breakage on an aircraft you or you're sort of trying to decode what has just happened so you catch everything and put it all back the way that it should be it's a big effort it's gonna take a lot of man-hours so having if it's a lightning strike it's gonna be very expensive lightning strike for sure so what is the cost typically if a a wind turbine loses a blade like a million million bucks a blade civically well no no no no the a hundred thousand dollars depending on well it depends on the size largely are the bigger the more expensive they are but to replace one usually means bringing out a crane cranes are pretty expensive depending if you can get a hold of one now yeah there should be a lot of them available you'd think but that's going to be a hundred ish maybe more grand to get the crane they're depending on how big the wind turbine is - because of the bigger they come the fewer cranes are are it's gonna be a couple hundred grand especially when the blade comes off and hits in the cell and does some destruction up there - then you're adding on to them the costing cuz you're going to put a new nacelle cover on you've got a fixed oil equipment that got damaged when the parts of the blade came through hopefully didn't hurt the generator and you know the worst case once is when the blade goes bad and hits the tower and takes out the tower and the whole thing comes collapsing down that's a that's a loss right there so they still have a lot of work to do I you know that's not a fun time that's gonna be a lot of a lot of extra work they weren't planning on doing right now could you pick a worse time for it to happen no you couldn't enough so you know it's just one of you it's one of those acts of nature I guess where you just have to deal with it yeah well it could be producing jobs so hey if you want to go clean up this wind turbine you know pick up all the pieces throw them in a satchel yeah it's probably true where you can there's parts one thing about Kansas is it's windy so whatever whatever hit the dirt is probably blowing around it all over and that's kind of that's a little bit north of tornado alley tornado alley Ken's be Wichita area and on the diagonal they're up to kind of Omaha Nebraska but yeah there's still a lot of wind down there Kansas is always windy I lived it for five years I remember toolsets blowing down the driveway because yeah wow it really that windy oh yeah it always blows 30 miles an hour welcome to Kansas the first thing you notice first thing you notice when you move out of Kansas is it's not windy anymore it's the worst it's just like it's the worst if it's breezy Breezies the best wind ease the worst wind is oh yeah but it makes great power I tell you that much it makes great power yeah that's fair that's fair so when these wind turbines are damaged how do these insurance claims go I mean I know you said you in the past that wind farm owners are very cautious with insuring everything they can and so I think you mentioned that you stepped on to a wind farm and they made sure that you had insurance yeah so how well do they they handle this stuff from an insurance standpoint well everything's about mitigating risk so the times I've been to different wind turbine sites usually they want an insurance policy of a million dollars before you can even walk onto the facility to look at anything which I always think is odd because the reason I'm there is I'm trying to save them millions of dollars and yet I gotta have a million dollar insurance policy I'm not sure what I'm gonna do while I am there that would cause a million dollar damage trip and maybe fall off of one maybe yeah yeah your wind turbines are pretty rugged it's over and it's like you look around and 11 of toppled it's like dominoes just like dominoes and you slink into the bushes like Homer Simpson that's that's the thing that kind of runs to your head like I don't know how I could do that much damage and let's to set these things on fire and even they even then I'm not sure but yes so everybody's risk conscious and with warranties and insurance policies you got to have insurance or something like that it's just like having an insurance on your automobile or on your home you're going to have insurance on it so you want to try to mitigate the amount of claims you're gonna make right in the insurance company doesn't want you to make claims so they want you to do the right thing make sure you're maintaining everything so it's kind of a vicious circle there's just like with your automobile right they got those little sensors you put in your cars now so they can track you to make sure you're not driving too fast or driving too erratically and you give you discounts on your insurance it's sort of a similar thing right so they if you take good care of you wind turbine so I have a lot of claims in theory your rates will go down it's a it's a marketplace like anything else well speaking of warranties so what's the typical warranty period that you know wind farmer gets when he installs a you know brand new wind turbine on his on his property yeah solar so the the company that wants to install a new the developer and so when the developer wants to install a new wind turbine site typically the OEMs offer a warranty somewhere between two and five years five years I mean I hear a lot more five years than I've heard in the past but five years tends to be a very typical warranty period so they have five years to sort of I call it within in the aircraft industry and other industries computer industries where first heard it was infant infant mortality so as the as a new device starts it's more likely to die in those first couple of months last years and at the very end of the life it's in the middle once you get past those first couple of months and years you're gonna be in the kind of stable territory so that's the highest risk points in that first really in the first couple of months when things tend to Bry is that is that they're catching like big defects yeah yeah you can catch things from that norm sort of manufacturing defects that you couldn't see like if you had some defect in the blade you couldn't inspect and then she'd get it up you started operating and you put the loads in the blades and obviously those defects could get amplified same thing in electrical equipment any kind of semiconductor device you like to have burned in time before you start using it because it's in that initial burning time where most of the devices will fail once you get past that burn in time you usually have very successful life it's just got a new car when you buy a new car in that first six months if the motor rolls over dead that's that's not great you like so that's why they offer those sort of warranties that are primitive front loaded that first two years you got a warranty or first three years they're gonna cover ground to the top so it's the same sort of thing in wind turbine so as you get it you want to make sure that you're in your covered for this first couple of years in case there's some sort of Manor manufacturing defect not necessarily at the OEM but maybe for one of their suppliers that you couldn't visually see and I just readers it's ugly head in those first couple of months so insurance is a big deal there and so I've heard you know like some companies like sky specs that their inspections are helping some of these wind farm owners kind of tap into those warranties right before they run out like you want to get prepared right before it runs out is that true yeah so what you want to do before the warranty runs once I runs out you want to get all the claims in so if you do have some sort of OAM related defect you want to catch it before the warranty runs out for sure right it's just like with a car before the car warranty runs out you want to take it to the shop make sure everything's sure everything's ok before you continue on using the vehicle the same thing happens on wind turbines the problem with wind turbines is they're so massive to do any thorough inspection to say you have a hundred turbines to do an inspection on a hundred turbines would take normally a lot of times so what happens is that the operators or owners developers depending who is owning at the time or who's going to buy it they want to do an inspection so they would take samples of so there's a hundred turbines out there they'll sample five and then extrapolate out and come to some agreement with the insurance company about how much it's gonna pay out with something like sky specs because they can scan each of the blades and the turbines within roughly 15 minutes per per turbine they can do a whole field a whole form of turbines in a day and have really detailed data so it just changes the whole marketplace because now instead of sampling 5 out of 100 okay that oh they can't do 100 turbines in a day but say they do 30 or 40 in a day so within three days they're gonna scan every single turbine that's on that site and have detailed data where you know turbine one is fine but turbine five 22 and 14 and 38 all have these issues that you wouldn't have caught otherwise because you're doing random selections so it does change the marketplace because now the next owner of that turbine site or the current owner get one gets insurance they collect in to fix those turbines if they're gonna sell it they're gonna sell a product that has been you know it's been brought up to snuff before the transaction happens so it helps everybody right but it does put a little bit more onus on the OEM to make sure those those wind turbines you know at least get to that warranty period without many difficulties so there's you know it's a catch-22 they're a little bit on the OEM side but for somebody like sky specs it makes a lot of sense where they can come in and quickly do a number of inspections accurate inspections and it just gives everybody data right Oh our whole world right now is depending upon data to make smart decisions and I don't know how anybody would do with that actually looking at each turbine that's the only thing that makes sense to me ya know that's a yeah it's that makes a lot of sense and obviously the faster you can get them all assessed and oh yeah a process done that's gonna be way easier course I'm sure you know five years ago when there were no drone inspections or ten years ago whenever it was there's a huge process like yeah let's get a hundred man out on ropes and climb like that's yeah knots ansible right terrible process yeah yeah a couple of guys going down a ropes and they're you know doing a visual inspection they can't do nearly as much as a drone can do especially from sky specs those things run so fast and take so much data there's no way a human could do that no way yeah so there's a really interesting article I want to I want to cover today it's called how digital twins could transform the wind and energy industry it's by Sue banker pal was a guest contributor to their site and basically the article is about how with obviously these physical assets like a wind turbine you're essentially can think of the data that you harvest from with enough really good like high quality sensors making a digital twin or a digital mirror of the assets already know a line from you know that it says so so this information can be sent via the cloud two piece of software for interpretation scrutiny either in the form of a 3d digital representation or raw data so basically they're taking all this data and saying here's what this data looks like as a three-dimensional representation of the wind turbine Hanoi said turbine turbine didn't need to throw in the British accent how do you feel about this that sort of like breaks my brain a little bit how do you feel about this well it's similar to what we have already done on aircraft in a sense where especially on helicopters anything that rotates vibrates and so a rotating wind turbine blade there's always vibration and shaking and stresses and loads the helicopter is very similar it sounds like what we like Sikorsky did years ago they got these health and monitoring systems they're where they're sensing for unusual vibrations they know what a good vibration is because the helicopter is always shaking so you you look for good vibrations when you see something start to to wander from what's normal is you can flag it and catch it early before something bad happens or catastrophic happens but in that system it's just shoving out data it doesn't really tell you exactly what's going on on the helicopter and it sounds like in this wind turbine application whether they've got this virtual twin they're trying to take the data or they have a bunch of sensors on the wind turbine so trying to take that data and provide a visual image of what's actually happening that's probably the most difficult part for anybody who is working in onm is to visualize what this sensor data actually means in terms of reality manok dan maybe you see a bunch of just raw data on a chart what does it mean yeah I just go along I go blind essentially yeah yeah you're like I don't know what does this mean what does it mean I got to change the bearings in this wind turbine or does it mean I just need to change the fuse over here right I don't know right right and probably that's probably where they're going if you could create a virtual wind turbine and say hey point to the area where you think the issues are maybe where the areas where there may be problems obviously using previous data to help pinpoint where new problems can occur that's not a bad move right yeah one that kind of reminds me of you know all those futuristic movies where all like the war rooms right it's got like get this big table and they manipulate all the little screens like they're moving around a symphony I was actually watching Minority Report oh yeah okay she was terrible as a movement it was terrible I actually know what slash read the book by philip k dick and i really enjoyed it it was like a very intelligent you know like and they changed so much of it now was the movie visually like fun absolutely okay but anyway that's a Tom Cruise movie I mean yeah how many bad Tom chronometer Tom Cruise he's insane crazy anyway Mission Impossible good actor okay I have a tough I'm not a huge action movie person so I have a tough time separating the fact that he's like an insane person in real life versus you know his characters he's an actor he's a good actor yeah he acts the same person in his movie something he's insane really anyway so but in that movie he's like you know the first it's one of the first scenes is him like manipulating the data from the precogs who if you've never seen Minority Report or read the book I highly recommend the book it's only like a five-hour audiobook not super long but basically the premise here getting off getting off to ask is that Tom Cruise's character runs the pre-crime unit which there's these three basically mutated humans who can see into the future and they spit out this data into they basically say like this murder is gonna happen so then the pre-crime unit goes out there and arrest the person before they commit the murder and of course in the book it's like all crimes it's not just murder in the in the movie it's only murder but so Tom Cruise is like visualizing he's he's got this visual big glass screen that shows the readout of the data of like basically what the precogs you know these these beings seeing in the future or seeing is just like trying to like make it make it make sense and so I feel like that's kind of what this is obviously like so many of those futuristic movies have these things where it's like this table where they're visualizing the data it's like these big table computers or holographic computers but this kind of reminds me the same thing where you could have like you walk into this big room that's like your dedicated virtual digital twin room and there's your whole wind farm like in augmented reality operating you can see how every you know how fast every blades spinning like where they're oriented all that stuff and it'll tell you you know the bearings are you know getting a little hot on this one or like this one's you know all those sensors are giving you all this data you can say oh turbine number 17 looks like he needs some attention next week he's been you know running a little a little sluggish or whatever it is and so it's kind of like Ironman right you ever see an Ironman you're not a Robert Downey jr. fan either oh my god I do like Robert Downey but I I just like I'm not in the movie / TV world last bunch of years infinity war the most popular movie ever I watched it oh I watch them all the Joe Rogan podcast I wish I was like that like he seems a very thoughtful good dude but he may be a great deal but you know iron man infinity Wars Avengers none of it I'm not just I'm not as nerdy as you alright I'm not a this is not nerd most of the world has seen it you're in the slight sliver society that has not seen it if there's anybody that's the nerd you're getting upset which is giving me more you're validating my minor my nerd your nerd Instagram my nerd labeling of you I'm not sensitive you're sensitive right it's no no it works right yeah no I was I was a spider-man kid growing up and I like to spider-man movies but they're like did you keep changing movie 3 times come on I agree I agree anyway I digress but this idea seems pretty interesting where it was just like this stream of data into spreadsheets and like what human being has the I mean obviously some of these data scientists do but this seems like it would make sense going forward to have yeah translating data a reality is such though it's the hardest part of anything right it's just like your iPhone you just bunch of noise in the back side but it's translated to something you can actually use it sounds for its it's similar to that right anything it gets to a good user interface it's gonna be successful well it also opens up yeah up these jobs potentially to people that aren't just the ones who are gifted enough to be able to stare it just partner there's a lot of people who are very visual learners or very yeah awed it's half the world's or whatever yeah and this guy oh I could do this job or in reality you know 10 years ago it's like I don't want to you know just be looking at data streams all day and in spreadsheets or you know all that so that that's engine you could potentially open this up to a lot of other people yeah I could the last thing I want to cover today is Vestas so it says wind vest when giant Vestas is cutting looks like about 400 jobs so obviously some more downturns for the industry just because the coronavirus and all the potential implications I think some companies are trying to get out ahead of it so what are your thoughts I understand why they're doing it I understand the financial implications so they're trying to make sure the company is secure financially as they go forward and once the coronavirus thing tampers down hopefully by the end of this year you know we can all get back at it again but in the meantime man it just delays all the all the great things that they've been working on and it pushes everything to the right so in the winter turbine industry new techniques designs improvements or just part of that industry when you take 400 people off the playing field it just slows down the whole industry so it not only hurts economically because all those people or have to find something else to do or just kind of find out the work you hate to lose them you want them to come back right you all you want everybody to come back to where they were to get everything up and running again but man it's it's a big blow because it's hard to find good people in wind it's such a specific field and yet take a specific skill set a lot of times to do the things that they're doing once you lose those people and it's not like you can always get them back so it just sits back companies we said that aircraft every every seven years as goes through cycles and a lot of good people go off and say I'm not doing that again I'm not going to be an industry that's cyclical like that and they'll go find something that's more stable go work for a government somewhere and it just drives it dries it dries slow periods in the economy and improvements in the world it just does you see it down there Washington DC right how are things in Washington DC they are pretty stable government wise the most stable job is probably working for the government yeah there's a lot of I do see much buy a lot of stability here in the city because a lot of lawyers who I assume are probably still doing the same work there's a lot of government jobs obviously like the IRS is here like all these big agencies here there's a lot of nonprofits those ones are probably a little more questionable in this in this climate but yeah those are three big ones for sure yeah yeah you just hate to see it and a lot of tech over here as well in the DMV area that DC metro Virginia so yeah well hopefully hopefully though that at least in the wind turbine industry we can get back going again and obviously if you're working in an industrial site which mostly is wind turbine places are quasi industrial depending on what part of the business you working in you can be close to work when somebody else is you're trying to assemble these in the cells and generators and things of that sort so you don't want to be working that close together and some part that makes sense that you're going to provide some separation but you know layoffs or a different story everybody's going home that's not good yeah I mean and not I think one of the big questions is like if there's any of these startup companies like obviously there's a lot of start-up drone inspection companies in the sector there's obviously it takes a lot more capital to get into the you know the manufacturing blades or manufacturing wind turbines themselves but all these small companies are probably maybe not going to survive or they're gonna have to really pivot heavily and quickly to survive the downturn so it's community how that plays out yeah yeah it's gonna be interesting times right we're in interesting times well on the one I mean I think the one thing that's and this is speaking probably a little bit from ignorance but I mean it seems like the inspection repair stuff at least for the technicians themselves a highly specialized job yeah I mean so I think they're still probably hopefully gonna be still heavy very heavy demand as they start to ease or striction because I assume as soon as a lot of these restrictions are eased they're gonna be sending repairmen back out real quick to get these turbines looked at that haven't had any yeah attention last couple months yeah it's a it's a big part of the industry the springtime at least in the northern hemisphere as things warm up over the wintertime it's very hard to go out and do repairs or to do inspections for that matter so now's the time everybody usually is getting to go over all May lovely time to be 800 feet off the ground dangling tomorrow hey it's above freezing it so beats being out there what at zero outside so you see a lot of activity typically this time of year so it's like April May June right this is the big go out there and fix stuff that happened over the winter time so there if everybody is sitting at home waiting to get back to work now they're gonna have more work by the time they get out there so they're gonna be really busy once the some of the restrictions have been lifted yeah and if anyone's out there listening and you want to take me on like a ride-along to go up the turbine I'll work for me I'd be terrified so I might need a second like a adult diaper or something but if you want to bring me along just sent us on send us an email dan da pick me up put a GoPro on your helmet and go oh for sure it would be it would be a fascinating experience and I think once you learn all the safety stuff and I mean these guys are the ropes the rigging is pretty incredible and they know what they're doing to stay safe there's a lot of redundancy and very high skill I'm like again that's a very technical job a lot of training but that mod attorney think pretty cool to be on top one of those things yeah the views are amazing so so open invitation if you want to have any come along just DM Dan
