 Well, hello Freddie Benson. Hi. Is, is Sam okay? Is she in the hospital? - No, she’s just in here. - Oh, thanks. Sam? - Sam, where are you? Sam? - Oh Sam’s not here. - But, didn’t you just say she was… - Well... Aren’t you a handsome boy full of questions. Look, I’m really worried about my friend Sa… handsome? Sure beans. Well, thanks. - So, you’re Cat? - Yeah, Cat Valentine. Why? - You like cats? - Yeah. - But, so, so you’re Sam’s roommate? - Uh-huh. - The girl who called me last night? - Yeah. Did you add me to your contacts? - No. - Well, there’s time for that. - Hi. - Nice hair. What are you? Jade! [gasping] What are you doing here? You said you wanted to work on our project. - At your house, not here! - Whatever! Let’s just go… No! You can’t! Okay, did you forget to take your special vitamins today? No! Uh, yes! I better go take ‘em now! Now just stay here and don’t move! I do what I want. That sounds like…   I think you're swell     I think you’re swell   - Robbie Shapiro! - Whoa! - Uh. - Oh, Cat, you’re back. Uh, Robbie was just singing me a little song he wrote called… I know what it’s called! He wrote that song for me! - Cat! - I’m swell! Me! He sang that to me over a year ago! Well, he’s singin’ it to me now. My life really is awkward. Robbie, I thought you and me had something special. Well, it seems like you’ve got something special with a lot of fellas! Tah! Good one, glasses! Dip! Rise. Dip. Rise. Dip. Rise. Dip. Rise. Derschlit, playtime’s over. I’m taking you back to your cage. [sighing] Okie dokie. You know, I’m really starting to enjoy it here in prison. I don’t care what you enjoy. Just… - You hear that? - Here what? Sounds like someone’s scratching on the door. Well, that’s peculiar. Chicken?! Well, who let a chicken in the prison? [struggling] [laughing] No, dang it. It’s Gibby. - What, Gibby? - Hey Sam, guess what? - I, I can’t talk right now. - You remember my head? - Your head? - No, the replica we got made of my head. Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, what about it? - I bought a hat for it. [laughing] How cool is that? - Bye. - Okay, talk to you later. - Oh, oh, oh, wait, wait, wait. - Yeah, what? - Remember that girl, uh, Nora Derschlit? - Yes, I remember Nora. Why? - She busted out of prison. - How do you know? - She came to see me at the movies. - She came to see you? For what? Ah, let’s see. Um... She said she wanted to locate and destroy Carly, then you, and then Freddie. - Oh. - And what did you say? Don’t worry. I told her Carly’s in Italy and Nora said that was way too far. Good. And then I told her you were in L.A. and I gave her your address. - What?! - Hey can you text us a pic of the hat? - Yes, I can. - No! Waaaah! Cock-a-doodle-doo! The cow says moo! [growling] See ya.

There we go. - I’m back. - Good. - How come I can’t sit over there with you guys? ‘Cause you’re not a main character yet. Oh. Hey, man. I know how it feels. It’s time to begin an exercise called… - Backwards Acting. Now you see… - Sikowitz! Cat, you’re very late! Class is almost over! This is more important than class! More important than teaching young people backwards acting? - Why are you dressed like a clown? - Who is that girl? - She’s my friend and roommate, Sam. - Well, she’s not allowed to be in… [alarm ringing] Ah, farm sauce. Class dismissed! Wait. I’m not in high school anymore. Huh. I graduated from Pacific Coast Academy several years ago. - Ahh. - Um. Now, I’m in college. I’m a sophomore at San Francisco State. - No, you’re not. - Wait. Why are you holding my special pink shoe? You gave it to me for… For porum. That’s false. I’m calling the head nurse. Ah! Sam, do you think we’re going to be in trouble. - Assistance! Someone! Assistance! - What’s happening?! - Make her give me my shoe! - No! Ah! Ah! [gasping] Ah! Get well soon! Nurse!
