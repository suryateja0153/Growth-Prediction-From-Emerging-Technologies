 okay all right there I'm George Bennett VP of business developer mind video and I'm gonna provide you about a 15 minute overview of the company what process mining is and more importantly what we're calling digital twin which is part of process mining but a lot of process mining companies don't create that digital twin and it's really important to understand it because a lot of the things that we're going to talk about things that we can do with process mining with simulation is very you've got that that digital twin so I'll go into some detail there and we also have at at 3:15 we have a demo we're going to show you the actual simulation we have time to show you the big the company and we're going to give you a demo but this is in half an hour it's hard to get to get the simulation part and also so if you want to see the simulation will provide that to you it's really great to be here I'm here with aqua Chucky and John Vergos from our company and I gotta tell you a lot of the things you heard today about process mining a lot of you go see very simulating there's a similar presentation here because a lot of the things that you heard this morning we're gonna cover again but in a little bit more detail on how we do it so just a little bit about the company process mining and then I'm gonna talk that we see digital transformation I'm really going to talk about digital twin and the best practices and then we have the aqua gonna do the use case this is for the company we're gonna put it in Italy I've been around about 20 years we've done a lot with BPM process improvement the different companies and the way the company really got started with the process mining get a very large Bank in Italy regulatory issues that they needed to address it really was any solution for that so out of that the mind video product was created again we have operations in the US we just open offices in Boston and exclusive distributor in Japan we also recognize in the marketplace is a leader not only in the BPM but also as a cool vendor and we continue to be recognized again we focus on a number of large companies large baking customers we're going to show you some we're doing fiat-chrysler but we're in banki manufacturing a lot of different industries primarily you ain't now in Europe but again we are opening office we just open offices in Boston were we're also Geographics obviously here but we also work with a lot of large systems integrators that are using our product primarily again in Europe but we also attract them here in the US so one of the things that we looked at it was talked about this morning was innovation all the different things about there with Amazon Google ai chatbots how do you take all of that into consideration and when you're taking like it from a process perspective how do you manage all that we talked about what you think your business model looks like and what it actually looks like I don't think this is that far off and so people's our representation the thing that we do with process mining is we take the actual data transaction logs and we create a real model of what your process really is and you can compare that to what you think your mama's not getting that more detail the other thing that we do see a lot is the obsolescence so I think one of our guys said legacy plot so when as soon as you build a bot today it could be in another month or two or six months it could be autumn and you need to maintain those BOTS we also make you have to maintain the process and one of the things with prospect with process mining within my video you can constantly monitor to make sure that your processes are running the way you think they're running which is very important and the other thing is again speed of change you can that's been talked about a lot but things are changing all the time so the processes you have today are not going to be the processes you can have at a year or two and how do you manage that how do you keep up with the speed of change and lastly what we do is and you'll see this but there are silos in every organization and how BPM that you can take a look at of maturity of the processes but what we do with process mining is really an end value change solution I'll talk about how we manage that so here's all the different silos and things that you're running today and what we do is we create a digital twin of those processes so we actually take the full value chain for the different processes ERP systems BPM and we create a virtual or digital twin of that so then we can take that and we can do things like simulation what if other things so we do we do modeling we do want a terrain and again we're not a governance company we're not we're not doing notations or documentation that's something that I graphics we do but we are we do do conformance checking real-time monitoring you can do predictive analysis and we do constant monitoring and the other thing is that you'll see this is part of the RP accelerator we're going to talk about is we can take our BPM model that we create compare it to the VPN model that I grabbed says and then there's a value chain the circle of how we work together so how does it work so we take these all these different systems on the Left we have a data extraction that it takes the data creates the logs we put that in the process mining tool we actually create a VPN model from that data and then we create a digital train also so what does that mean so again for this banking example they had to have a bank closure within 15 days and they couldn't figure out where the process were stuck where were they were was being where the bottleneck was so using our product taking the winner and say where is the where is the process where that maybe there's an exception maybe there's a variance and how they're actually supposed to be using the process and you could take a look at will highlight those areas not only from a performance perspective but a FTE perspective and a cost perspective and then again with the digital twin because it's a exact representation of the models nobody else does this from process money perspective nobody else does this kind of simulation so with the simulation model is couple things you could do one is if you wanted to want to make a process you could go in and say I want to automate a specific process within this flow they'll tell you the results they'll tell you how that changes the model I'll change I'll show you also what the it's a time frame or cost of water light so I see you in the in the marketplace today is with RP especially if companies have to forget the low-hanging fruit they go with the EPO in India and they and not have made much up there but then they get stuck and say how do i what is the next process I need to model and if they don't really our ally is real difficult for them to prioritize or a cost justify you know where the next for the next automation projects to be so I work with a lot of large companies last two years of doing automation projects and they'll start the arcade process they'll do maybe 15 or 20 bots or a hundred watts and then they'll say wait a minute we do get the ROI we didn't see what we thought we're going to see and so using our tooling you actually go in there and model and say okay if we did automate this part of the process what is what is the impact could it be what does he are like gonna be and so this is we see this is a very critical piece to a lot of company is trying to figure out what their RP strategy is if you can go in and model and simulate what the benefits gonna be before you actually run it and you can actually decide what processes you're going to use to automate and what your or Eliza so we think this is very can be very very critical and one of the reasons I joined this company because we were struggling with our PA projects he's going to figure out you know how we do the ROI ahead of time without spending like hundreds of thousands of dollars and a lot of resources by doing the simulation ahead of time you could actually go back and say here the processes we should be changing your show should be automated and here's gonna be our life so dis real quickly how it works we do the process set up there is a process of discovery we go and do compliance again this is what we see if it matches the BPM model that we are creating with the transactions compared the model that you have it could be the high graphics model we can go in and do automation and and say okay if we do that automation what there's gonna be the rework we keep track of performance we have the simulation again this is something that no other process mining companies doing because create that digital twin so we can also do real-time predictive analytics and then the improvement piece is really up to the customer do you want to you actually want to implement the RP changes what other changes do you want to make within your your process and it's a closed-loop system so again you go back to your discovery check the KPI is do additional simulation and we see a lot of companies that are doing continue to make this you know it's an ongoing process so one of the things we talked about with the RP accelerator where does this fit so my graphics my Nvidia perspective see you can see this the ones in the blue is really my graphics one is mine video okay so for my graphics perspective very good at model design process analysis risk and compliance that's you know that's what they do we don't do that we do the process mining we do discovery conformance checking with with the model again my graphics does the analysis we do the simulation analysis then there's decision-making that's done with the AI graphics we use our PA that's not a very good graphics or behavior and then we also do performance to compliance monitoring and it's again it's a closed loop circle so again this is something that was just announced and I think it's I know it's the only thing that's out there like that today we you're using we have a VPN that our PA and a process mining - all in one package ok so you can see so we take that we're really getting the benefits of everything that we do everything that they're doing and we're integrated so we think this is something that the markets been asking for looking for and they've been really kind of clusion it all together and we're doing this as a as a combined package with that I'm going to turn it over to iacopo to do a demo of our product thank you so much George one second okay good afternoon everybody my name is Jakob Kuchiki and the P of marketing at my video before I get started the with the demonstration I want to apologize for my accent which is pretty strong and it's because I live in Worcester and work in Boston but I'm originally from Italy so the demonstration that I will give you is about the account payable process of a major car manufacturer and 400ma is not familiar with the process the countable process includes all the analysis and processing of transactions between the company and it suppliers and consider that every time that any voice is recorded by the company and account payable is created the client at the treatment objectives so the first was to understand that how its process was actually working and particularly the client who was interested in analyzing the different fat violence so what we have heard today many times potential bottlenecks and the resources involved so who does what second main point was about compliance so to monitor ow our Ozzie's process our actual process deviates is different from our reference model of the process again what ed was mentioning today and also the client wanted to be able to monitor the impact of changes and blocks to invoices on the performance of the process and finally the client wanted to understand what its payment behavior was so when was it late with payments and why was it late with payment so given that and jumping now on the demonstration and you don't see it let's see if you zoom out okay so I'm now accessing a mind video on the cloud but my videos also available on premises and what you're looking at is the model of the actual process that has been automatically generated so automatically my mind video the way that my videos generated this model is by simply importing into my video data that were extracted from the informational system used by the process decoders and in this case the information system was a SAV so from this alein representation where boxes are representing activities and arrows the transitions between activities the darker the box the more frequent activity and the thicker guerrero they were frequent that path we can understand immediately what our assist process looks like normally so the invoice is created by the supplier it is then received by the carbon facture it is their accountant and paid for and we can also see that there are other activities that can be performed that much more less frequently except for this one that is a pretty interesting fact it is in voice-over Joe it means that we are late with our payment and the de sac tivity might be nurse telling us that admins in more than 50% of cases now another cool thing that I want to show you is that not only with my video we generate that representation that in addition of the process but also a complete BPMN and better over the disease process so this has been generated automatically and you see that includes of reasons together with and you can do two things basically with this model you can either update your process repository for instance on a graphics and you will be able to do this seamlessly or you can also run make changes to the model and run simulations about what happens to the process behavior when you implement changes so I think it was a head or syrup today we're talking about how to measure ROI so that's an easy way to do it and the prediction of videography going back to the analysis of our model so our client wanted to understand what the different variants are the process and it's very easy to do it with my video because we do it automatically so for instance this is the most common area it is shared by more than 42 percent of invoices and we see that on average our lead time for the process is 48 days when we are in this papaya the management of the company was added with this performance we can see the second part buyer involves an additional fifth activity that is the inverse of a job so we relate with the payment the English to virtue activity occurs after we have account the invoice and this part violent is shared by 30% of cases and the average of lead time in this case is over 72 days that so the company is not happy with this performance but what is even more interesting is this fat barrier because we have the same five activities defied before but this time the in vegetable do activity happens before the invoice is actually received by the company so this is a major insight that we learned with my video with process intelligence and we are basically in other words saying that we are recording invoices that are already past you when we received them so huge and in this case the average early time is about 110 days and with this Trip Advisor to have record about 85% of our invoices I stay with me it's clear so so far we're still analyzing our as this process and we've looked at its frequency and volume dimension but we can look at also its time dimension and this visualization adds as a to squats very easily what the potential bottlenecks in the processor for instance if I look at this arrow it's thicker so it means that there are more days that passed between these two activities involves block release imports block waiting for approval and imports block released so this means that there is a potential bottleneck there so we know that it's a high amount of days in terms of absolute values now the question is is this performance bad for the manager like does it represent a misalignment with what the management is expecting there and since with manteno we cannot enter KPIs and the monitor automatically the compliance of our process with this kpi's we can answer this question immediately automatically you see this is a red arrow so main business telling us that this transition is also a misalignment with the KPIs the last thing that we wanted to analyze the last dimension of this process that we wanted to analyze is its resources perspective so from this array she is looking metrics where you have the activities in the middle and the resources on the sides it's very easy to understand who does what for instance if I go on the potential bottleneck that we have identified before you see that destroyed the resources that are have been here anonymized I performing that activity are involved in that activity and my peers telling us also there all of these resources these are a financial responsible so very quickly whether understood will be better our process works and we have identified a major flaw in the process we're recording invoices already past you and identified a potential bottleneck now the second objective was about compliance so we have a reference model so how we will like our model our process to perform so what are the deviations from that reference model and again we can do this automatically with the main video once that we have uploaded that the reference model that for instance you keep on a graphics and again will be seamlessly to import the model from the graphics you see red on the Left all the activities that are not expected in the epitaphs described in the reference model and we cannot show insight about this deviation for instance we can see that in more than 50% of cases we have deviation spaces and when we have divisions our average of lead time passes from 48 days to 91 days and the average cost per case also slightly increases we can see then also what the most frequent deviations are for instance in Westover Joe is the most frequent it has we see that when we have this division the average lead time is 92 days the cost doesn't change significantly however when we have the second most common division in West block released we have an average lead time of 122 days and the cost is three times the one where we don't have any deviation from the epitaphs so another key insight and we can go deeper with analysis with the root cause analysis for instance here I can see which resources are involved with the deviation which is the row and which suppliers also are involved in the division so all is automated and what we wanted also to be able to monitor was also the bed form at the impact of blocks and changes to importance on the performance of the process and I'm waiting but from our personality we can have physical configure a very easily - course that can help us to pursue this objective for instance this - Porter was a designer to monitor the blocks on the process and how they impact the process these are blocks that we have identified and we can see for each of them the average wait time and their frequency so again inverse block released is the most critical block and we can also see what they impact of each block on the performance of the processes for instance if I want to see the impact of this the inverse properties block on the processing time of the process I just make two clicks and I see that we switch from 26 days to 65 days average processing time so very easy to do and the last objective that we had was to be able to monitor our payment behavior so to understand when were being late and why were being late and again with another dashboard we can do this pretty easily here we see for every month how much we're paying on time and how much for being late so I see that the sixth month of the years of June we are paying later the IIST amount and I can have instead also on our payment behavior per supplier or see for instance how many invoices a day late and a manual time and these are insights that you can either perhaps also from other intelligence tools however what we do is the process intelligence so not only you can have these indicators but understand for instance when we have a late payment cases what are the different part variants that lead to this cases for instance if a know that the most frequent but violent pleaded to a late payment again we find that what we found before that were registering impulses that are already past you we can do this because we are really looking at what is that in the process so to wrap up this was just a taste of what we can do with my video I haven't shown you a since the simulation capability which is very important but that my colleagues and I are very happy to see you and discuss about this anymore thank you so much any question so as you were presenting the concept to the digital twin there was what I thought was a bunch of inputs different input sources that you could tap into and it was hard to see one of them appeared to be an automation anywhere welcome okay got it thank you so yeah so you see like we import the data and we just need presence the ID of each invoice then and the information about the time becomes inefficient desease okay procede so it's not a lot of data that we're extracting to create the model just those three pieces if you have the start date and the end date if you other additional views and also if you have the wrapper for the person who actually working on it we couldn't you can show you the resources that are associated with it so when we go through for a lot of the different processes up that we already have like the basic models for like p2p click here to pay or order to cash accounts payable those kind of things those models for safety and other ones we got that in our our repository of basic processes that we it's alright this section you have asked about capturing things that are not on yet so unless you have a modeling tool like a digital print you're not gonna be able to do that right say the power of this is that you can actually use different sort of process optimization techniques whether it's Sigma well they're clean whether you think maybe you put a weapon here or web based application that once you create that digital twin you and your architects and your business leaders can sit down elaborate it take hey you know what's the best way to address automation and then you can model in here you can then you know with the simulation engine you control data on it and see how it's been actually performed before you spend a dime right right so the good thing about the simulation once we extract they never say we do a date with the date maybe there's 50,000 transactions in there what are the simulation and I think it's a patented technology as well we could take that data and jumble the data to level we can create albums of variations of that same data so we don't constantly have to pull data from your systems and that company capture all different kind of variances so we are going to be doing a demo of a banking solution that does show the simulations that works that's kind of cool well are you really showing you hit with analytics and pretty much process right [Applause]
