 it was impossible it was like he was gonna have to roll a one in a hundred at disadvantage he rolls two twenties both nat twenties he rolled double that twenties at this advantage throwing a rock into a hole with magical darkness against this fleeing black dragon i had to give him the hit the whole table was screaming you know there's no way he could hit it he hit it and he killed that dragon hi i'm joe manganiello and this is dungeons and dragon support [Music] okay this is from silk the crocker aka crocs fans only hey people who play dundas and dragons out there what's the best way to start slash learn slash get into it well i think there's two ways you can go one you can get three books you need three books to play d and d you need the players handbook you need the dungeon masters guide and you need a monster manual from there it's pretty self-explanatory make a character you're going to get between 50 and 70 of how to play d and d or at least all the necessary questions you're going to want to ask from creating a character so crack a player's handbook pick a race pick a class pick your background get your equipment set your character up then from there somebody's going to need to run the game so if you're ambitious you love storytelling the way that i do you're going to lean into becoming the dungeon master rather than a player now dungeon masters you're going to want to read the dungeon masters guide get acquainted with the monster manual see what monsters in there you like you don't you want to throw at your characters blah blah blah then you're going to want to either home brew an adventure which means you write your own or the other option i would say that just simplifies things is to get the starter kit which is a boxed set and everything once again is self-explanatory but it's on a smaller scale that's how you get into it brother oh the next question is from my buddy sam witwer dungeons and dragons question what's a more dangerous character to have in your party lawful evil or chaotic evil it's a great question sam and one that i feel like i am uniquely qualified to answer i would say the better thing for the party would be a lawful evil character because at least there are rules there are collective goals that can be adhered to you might have a you know dragonborn worshipper of tiamat in your group uh who plays really well with the group and there's a collective goal but there's also because of the lawful evil there's a kind of a long play goal there's a goal outside of the group that this dragonborn paladin of tiamat would be also attempting to achieve but they can play nice within a group it's kind of like when magneto came to take over the x-men after charles xavier died and they could see eye to eye and a common goal but you got to watch out once you start achieving that goal because that lawful evil character might flip chaotic evil on the other hand chaotic just doesn't play nice i've been in groups chaotic players have dungeon master progressive chaotic players it's like a great having a gremlin in your group that's just going to throw a monkey wrench everywhere you go so i think that that would be a lot more frustrating you'd want to kill them or throw them out next one is from star shinobi good morning or afternoon evening depending on where you live question for today what was your favorite way a gm has a game master has opened a campaign or one shot we've all woken up in a cell or we're sitting in a tavern but have you had anything unique i'm interested yes my friend john castle ran us through this adventure where we were unconscious and we all woke up didn't know where we were had no armor no weapons and we were all realized we were chained to each other on a slave barge so we all had to kind of wake up and then decide what to do and i was playing a minotaur so i started like headbutting our captors off the barge into the water and now we were fighting and kind of chained up and he created these cool mechanics for us being chained up and how that worked and how we could try to break the chains or you know work together or how much we could move or not move and i just thought it was really ingenious and a very very smart way of starting out and then we had to like the guys we killed they're you know subdued we had that then those became our weapons so we were just trying to piece together anything we could get to keep fighting and get off of this barge and and fight for freedom so that that was a cool one just you know off the cuff okay mariah sanchez aka mariah in reality tips for a first-time dungeon master a dungeon master is a storyteller you're a showrunner of a long-form narrative that's going to take place over months and maybe years so you always want to be you know all the you know few steps down the road understanding how to set up these character arcs these story arcs that have payoffs down the line so with that said you know what are your arcs what's going to be satisfying to your players and that's going to differ for every group so a dungeon master also has to have the type of chess like approach to storytelling where you're building these tracks out ahead you know your 3 10 moves chess moves ahead on the board from your players but you're also going to have to be empathetic to the point where you can understand you can look into the heart of your players and understand what each one of them wants from the game some want to hunt for treasure some want to cause chaos mythology and deities and and kind of religion and magic and deep dive storytelling so you kind of want to gauge how your players are or what they like then you're going to mold that story and be able to use those archetypical qualities in order to build you know stories and throw things at them you know it's a dungeon master have fun understand your players and prep because inevitably your players are never going to go where you think they're going to go they're going to choose their own crazy narrative they're going to kill the shopkeeper that you wanted to have become part of their group and this great storyline they're just going to murder him and steal all of his stuff so you need to be ready for all of that in the moment and along with prep i would say keep lists post-it notes on the inside of your dungeon master shield with names on them just tons of names male names female names human names dwarven names elven names just because you're gonna have to be pulling those out of your ass way more than you could ever possibly imagine so that's another uh probably the fourth big key to being a dungeon master just be ready to pull it out of your ass that gets into like listening to your own inspiration wherever you want the story to go or you get an inspiration to take it just take it there just go there all right this is from turk owl that is a dragon's question do rogues get to attack twice per action if they have daggers in both hands kind of lost on this logistic all right that's an interesting question yeah i can see how that would be confusing there's a fighting style where you can you can have a second attack and there is a feat in which you get to add your damage bonus to attacks or off hand attacks so you know you either need the fighting ability or you need a feat that allows you to strike with two hands we're talking daggers here so we're talking about a small weapon rather than a large weapon which gets into a whole other thing because there are feats of war fighters in which they can carry you know heavy weapons in both hands this is from at optional rule i break his knees in quotations many a d d or tabletop role-playing game game master looks on in horror as the players torture someone who doesn't do what they want how do you handle this in your games do you overlook it penalize them encourage them hey i'm just the referee i just set up the world i'm just the the voyeur i mean don't get me wrong i'm also the architect of the long form story so i'm the one who's setting the the tracks down you can gently nudge people into storylines that you think are going to be really interesting but inevitably it's up to them because they may decide to go the other way so you need to be ready for that and with that said the beauty of role playing is that you can do whatever you want if they want to kill and torture the shopkeeper they can do that they can do whatever they want so they're going to start with the shopkeeper but then they're going to take out the sheriff and his deputy when they get there and then they're going to take over this town and hold them hostage i always get excited whatever the players do because i'm just going to go with it you know my players sometimes come across hill giants in the wild and a fight breaks out and they kill all the hill giants and then when they go and they search the bodies of the hill giants i'll say yes um it's interesting you hear something making a noise in the pocket of the hill giant's vest you look inside of the you know the vest pouch and it's like a little bone rattle that looks like it would fit into the hand of a of a baby hill giant oh and what's this it's a it's a taxidermied fox that's been stuffed like a like a child's toy somewhere off in the distance you swear you hear the the faint sound of a baby crying you know so it's like you just wiped out a whole village of hill giants and you think yeah we did it and now i'm gonna make you feel bad because you left all these like orphaned hill giant babies out there screaming in the night so it's like i always try to make my players feel bad about wiping things out because there's so much just head chomping off and lighting people on fire in d d that a lot of times the humanitarian angle never gets covered you know but that's kind of the sense of humor that i have of my players you know like i said man it's just have fun with it let it go it's it's not up to you it's up to them and then you just start guiding it where you want it to go because yeah ultimately as the referee you can be as hard on them as you want or not depending on how you feel or you know whatever parabasis next dungeons and dragons question what was your favorite character class and race growing up i was big in the elves because elves had a little bit of magic and a little bit of fighting and i really like them 2e dragon lance i i was a minotaur the second you could be a minotaur i was a minotaur of course and now when i say elf i'm not trying to get out of answering what's my favorite class back in the day elf was race and class you were an elf which means you had you had both which is kind of interesting i love playing a warlock i'm playing a warlock right now in a mad mage dungeon the mad mage campaign and man there's just so many tricks up their sleeves so for me i love playing characters that have tons of options like i have a high level sorcerer that i love playing because along with the meta magic and then you really have tons of options you know and ways to get out of situations or ways to be creative or ways to participate in the storytelling you know if you twin polymorph t-rexes inside of a tavern doesn't matter what the dungeon master had planned you're in charge now of the story you know you just caused this to happen so i really like being able to really affect the story and i find that those spell casters there's a lot of wow factor okay this is from j jlj f legere aka geekbot question is is it weird that i practice character voices in front of the bathroom mirror no i don't think that's weird i don't do a character voice too much when i'm a player unless i'm like delivering some opus or some charisma check but when i dungeon master i i it's his voice is all over the place all my npcs have voices whether they're yeah the lady sweet little lady works don at the uh at the apothecary your name's tony you know weigh-ins want what can i get ins that's basically the pittsburgh dialect where i grew up so you know and then my brother will start laughing people have been in pittsburgh will start laughing people even who haven't benefits from start laughing because it's such a rich character and it's based on somebody who works at a sandwich shop back home you know that i know and then they become a character and then ian she gavrin um see my nephew donnie in that he's a blacksmith you know and then they go and visit donnie he talks the same way you know or like you know all of the animal familiars or you know the druids speaking animals then there's there's all of those voices you know of all of the like the christmas the christmas animals in south park you know if they talk to a squirrel the squirrel talks like the hat of course and then they want to talk to the horse and the horse oh they went that way or they talked to a seagull but the seagull wasn't impressed at all with what they were doing even in fact he was he was amazed any of them wound up alive uh how sloppy they were and uh they asked to seek all you know what's your name you can call me christopher squaken i think you should take it a step further and film yourself doing the character voices that way you could critique your performance i don't know maybe there's some sort of career for you here you're going to become an actor or something but no man that's that i totally do all of that i i always develop voices or i figured a voice out and then make a note to myself somewhere down the line i need a character that's going to talk like ted knight in caddyshack you know and then when they get to the council's oh hello hmm yes that's usually how my dm'ing goes as well so i identify i just pivot from voices but you can see that it's just it's endless i'm always making notes of this voice or that voice and uh you know and popping those characters up along the way seragushi underscore arts what would be a fearsome and evil name for a black dragon and what kind of a gem would you give him good question so i actually just answered this question so i designed a quest book for the relaunch of hero quest i named the black dragon venom v-e-n-i-m which i like she should take that and i would think i don't know for a gem i would give the black dragon a giant amethyst some gigantic huge massive amethyst that had some sort of like even in darkness had some sort of like magical ability to to create light from the inside almost like a pulsing but it's just the way that the light shifts and hits it but even in the dark you can see the light sparkling inside somehow it's got its own kind of thing going on anyway there you go this is from one crit wonder what is your favorite d d campaign setting and why i love dragon lance i just do i like crin i like that there are books that are companions that give you a fully fleshed out view of the world because i find that with some of the other worlds it's very hard to get the canon straight and it's very hard to understand you know pantheons and gods and it just seems like there's so much catch-up work and there are all answers to these questions but it's like so hard to find them and there's different answers to different questions anyway with crin if you don't include the fifth age stuff that was done without margaret and tracy if you only look at the margaret and tracy cannon or at least you know the books that they you know okayed you get this rick really beautiful amazing deep world that involves all the things about fantasy that i like which is you know fighting and friendship and family and romance and love my gosh it just seems like they're trying to eradicate romance from from d and d and tabletop and so i really love dragon lance for that reason it's it's very human and you understand the gods you understand what's at stake and there are great npcs and villains and things and you know my favorite you know characters in all of d and d cannon so i like dragon lands i like crin um recently i've gone into collecting all the old dark sun modules and and box sets so um those are starting to pile up so maybe over the holidays i'll be able to dive into those okay this is from matt holmes aka table top payton if your pc's philosophy differs from the rest of the group do you roll up a new one conform to the group or see how much you can get away with behind their backs you're trying to make me an accomplice or somehow justify you destroying your party uh play nice young man don't be a menace to your own group you know or something where like somebody's gonna want to punch you on the way up the stairs because i've had players that try to split the party and that becomes their thing i'm gonna go explore and some character dies people get pissed and they have words with each other about it so you know it's a team game play nice with other kids in the sandbox but with that said like don't let that get in the way of of a great character all right this is from edward r curtis aka dimly underscore lit it's very gothic odd dungeons and dragons question typically when making your player character do you come up with the character first then the race class stuff or the other way around choosing the race class stuff then making a character around that interesting question um i think it differs i think it just differs from character to character when i was a kid we didn't have dragonborns those came around in fourth edition and i wasn't playing that was on a dnd hiatus doing like third and fourth edition so when i met back up with fifth edition and i saw that you could play as a dragonborn and then i saw that they were chromatic i thought oh man that's like playing a low level you know or aspiring dragon highlord or someone in the dragon army in dragonlance in the dragonlance books and i just thought man that is like super cool we didn't have like i said we didn't have that when i was a kid so i naturally gravitated towards picking a red dragonborn first i liked paladins i i thought paladin was a you know really cool class growing up and a little bit of magic lots of fighting then i saw that there was a possibility of playing an oath breaker if your dungeon master allowed it so that's how i built that character archon yeah and then other times it's like i already know what the character is you know he's going to be a little halfling who has all black leather and a mask and he walks around and talks like this and he you know and he's a wild sorcerer because every time he shoots magic he doesn't know what's going to happen and you know and you know so all of a sudden now i have this little like german s m halfling wild sorcerer that i just cooked up in my brain and all right i'll make that character and play them okay the next one is from the danwood spiral i if that's a nine inch nails reference then that's awesome currently making some homebrew races for my own d d setting any abstract ideas weird is good i don't know man i always thought about like you know a civilization of dark gnomes i have all kinds of other ideas that i use you know in my game and float around i mean i'll give you one i wanted something between dragon and draconian because i you know i have the fifth edition draconian stats don't tell anyone so i wanted something in the middle there kind of like a tank that could move in and so i created these abominations and created a storyline of how they were being created and then i just stated them up and you know throw them at my players okay next question is from yum diem when a character dies and the player makes up a new character what level do you start them at in old older versions of d d first edition second edition basic you had characters in a party that were all different levels because the game was really centered upon getting your character at the highest level it could possibly go getting your character the best magical items the most gold cetera you had players in the party you could have a ninth level player with a first level player with a second level player whereas in fifth edition it is more centered around the collective story that you're telling all the characters in the group go up at once you don't have characters going up on different levels generally so you know when a character dies jumps back in and you might play it differently but all my characters are all at the same level they all move from fourth to fifth level together from fifth level six level together so it's easy you just jump them back in at that level but it's dm's choice a dungeon magic can do anything if you think it's better storytelling wise to start somebody off at level one while the rest of the group is advanced like go for it like that's that's totally fine okay this is from at trash mob minis maybe a dumb question there's no dumb questions but i'm a dumb dm okay how do i get the players to form bonds between their characters is this a chemistry that happens at its own pace or is there something i can do to catalyze connections good question there's always a narrative story element that can tie characters together whether they came from the same place or they start having the same dreams and start relating that to each other that somehow are tied they might have been somewhere at the same time but you can text them both separately in between sessions and let them know that there's this part of their backstory there's this part of their backstory but the other thing is is like yeah i mean i think it's just gonna happen you know i had a character who was a bear barbarian and he was just used to taking all the punishing damage and soaking that up but there was a cleric in the group and the cleric this guy was amazing he would keep it's my friend jason lyles he would keep track of what everyone's hit points were everyone in the group and he was like the greatest cleric i've ever played with and he knew how many hit points i had as the barbarian in his job he would keep feeding me healing so my character's job was to soak up all the damage and make sure everybody attacked him and it was this really great symbiotic relationship that we formed that then became like the story line where on a role-playing sense my barbarian character had done a lot of things that he regretted and there he was this like holy pious character who believed in this god and believed that the god could save my my character soul there became this storyline between the born out of the characters out of the both of them where um they kind of needed each other and fed off of each other you know it's really cool when that stuff happens so you know but there's only so much of it that you can force upon your players at oregon rolled a 20 what is your best d d memory um probably comes from a couple of years ago right around the holidays close to my birthday my wife there was this big box next to the front door she told me to go bring the box into the kitchen and i did and i opened it and unbeknownst to me sophia had had someone at within d d connect her to jeff easley who painted all the cover paintings for the old players handbooks and dungeon masters guides and adventure modules he's one of the four horsemen just you know one of the great great great fantasy painters of all time and um she got in contact with him and had him paint my arkhan the cruel my my my dragonborn oathbreaker paladin of teammate she surprised me with this original jeff easley painting of archon in front of tmat like it was the cover of one of those old books but you know to be honest like there's there's a great d d memory every week in our games that's kind of the beauty of it something unexpected happens every week all right so that's it from me joe manganiello i want to thank the amazing artists and storytellers and writers dundas and dragons was really a fountainhead of creativity for me as a kid is where i learned how to build a character build a backstory where i learned long-form storytelling as it pertains to writing and producing and directing and really just sparked my lifelong love of telling stories so thank you so much for your questions i had a blast answering them and i hope we get to do it again someday thanks a lot
