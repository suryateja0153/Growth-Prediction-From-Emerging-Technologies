 all right welcome to the ask the expert azure iot from connected assets to connected environments with azure digital twin session of ignite 2020. we're going to talk a little bit about azure digital twins with you the audience in fact we're actually going to be taking questions from you where we will be having them answered live by our in-house experts and members of the actual development team behind azure digital twins now uh one of the things you're going to want to do here is understand how you can engage with us during this session so you will notice that within this team's live event there is a chat where you can ask questions and what we will go ahead and do is as you ask those questions we have a panel of moderators that are reviewing those and if the question is deemed good and also looks like something that we can share with the rest of the audience we will go ahead and approve them conditionally i would also like to inform you that if you have a question or see one that someone else has asked and perhaps you'd like to see the answer to it as well go ahead and upvote it using the thumbs up icon next to that question and that will allow us to get it a little bit higher up in the queue in terms of importance so that'll make sure that you get a better chance of having those types of questions answered in the allotted time that we have for today and we will bring the experts actually on camera so you actually see them live answering your questions just like it's face to face we're we are beating down covet 19 the best we can with teams technology and hope that you can take advantage of this with us and of course at the end of this session we will provide resources that you can all tune into to be able to find out more information about the azure digital twins topic that we will be presenting on now before we get started i do want to inform everyone that this session is very likely going to be recorded and stored in the annals of ignite 2020 history so do be aware that these questions that you ask are going to perhaps make history uh we do want to ask that all of our attendees please do not spam or post any inappropriate comments in the chat it creates extra work for us and really just you know there's enough problems already we don't need an additional one today um so and finally i would like to inform everyone that we will be adhering to the microsoft code of conduct and essentially what this means in a nutshell is please be respectful both to the audience as well as the expert panel that will be answering the questions as part of this session we want to make sure that this is a safe environment for all who attend and ensure that we have an excellent recording that can live on for additional attendees who might not be able to to attend the session live to view at their leisure so with that said we'll go ahead and start introducing the expert panel and while we're doing this uh please think about some of the questions that you want to ask we will lead in with a bit of an introduction to azure digital twins after this you'll have a little bit of extra time but for now let's go ahead and get started with our experts uh going up first is christian shorman who is the azure iot partner pm manager who loves to create music in a spare time and i'm curious christian what kind of music is that do you go for a particular style is there a particular instrument involved here tell us a little bit more about that yeah thank you anything between pop and minimal music and mostly with electronic instruments and guitar and so excellent so do you do you make the lo-fi type of coding music that that is so popular these days that people put on in the background is is that the style i'm hearing no no more more like traditional styles so excellent excellent well if you want to plug your soundcloud or wherever we can hear your music now's the time to do it um if you don't that's okay too uh so coming up next is aness khalifi the azure iot principal pm manager and interesting fact about an s she actually had a career as an international and collegiate tennis player uh i'm curious uh that because that is quite an accolade uh could you describe for us the the most intense match of your tennis career wow you've got you've hyped it up uh quite nicely there i did want to be a professional tennis player and spend a lot of time playing um hardest match uh it's hard to quantify i played college tennis so probably the hardest matches is when it you know it's down to your match and if you win the whole team wins and if you lose well the whole team loses and then everyone's kind of gathered around you and screaming and yelling so i think those are probably the the toughest toughest matches i've probably played yeah love it love yes those individual sports where you play with the team are so uh just just fulfilling when you're able to help carry the team across the line like that that's amazing finally i'll introduce myself really really quick i will be the moderator picking out the questions for our expert panel today i'm a principal cloud advocate working on our uh advocacy team uh specifically focused on iot at microsoft and my claim to fame is uh and you can you can look this up on whatever search engine you want probably by just typing in these words a once ordered starbucks from a commodore 64. and so with that we will go ahead and move into an introduction on what is azure digital twins um we'll kind of give a nice little overview to lay the framework here for those questions and once we've got that out the way we're going to start with the first questions that are coming from the audience yeah um i won't spend too much time on this i think maybe a lot of you have just watched the iot keynote by sam george but at high level yeah azure digital twins is really for us about you know creating the next generation iot solutions that really model the real world and there's obviously a set of core capabilities um that are part of azure digital twins that accelerate you know any customer business or partner for for bringing that you know uh physical representation to life digitally uh and there's really four key pieces one is our open modeling language so what you would use to describe whether it's the people the places the things everything you want to kind of bring to life and then we have the live execution environment so as you model things in the real world you want that to be represented you know in a graph and be kept up to date and live and that's really you know at the heart of the the core capabilities for azure digital twins and then um obviously you want to feed that graph and augment it with interesting inputs from from iot like iot hub or from other business systems you have other services that feed interesting data that you also want to be able to represent in a graph to get the best contextual insights that that you can for your business solutions and then you know as you build that graph and digital representation of the physical world you know there may be other things you want to do like a historian at analytics or ai or simulation and we have nice integration with various services uh where you can output the interesting things from the graph so that you can do more at depth with some of these other azure services as well excellent thank you for that introduction and s and now we're going to go ahead and open this up with our first question from the audience this first one which has gotten a ton of upvotes please keep up voting these questions this is 10 up votes probably going to be the high score but let's see if we can beat it so oliver asks i am about to embark on a digital twin platform creation next month and i have a ton of questions i'll ask one by one first can you integrate any hardware into this solution i.e can i use a microprocessor like raspberry pi pick stm32 it would be awesome if it's just a matter of use this library and integration just works so i know there's a pleasant answer to this question um and s uh christian would y'all uh who would prefer to take this one christian you want to talk about her hub so um adt basically is driven by data from devices through rest apis so anything that can make a rest api call you can integrate with adt quite easily and so um you can you know pick up messages from azure iot hub you know and and send the messages on to azure digital twins or you could um use an environment like um like logic apps to generate rest api calls into adt really anything that can make a rest api call can send a message into adt and drive you know like twin state excellent so in summary there if if it can make an api request you're in business basically if it can make an http call it can call us and if you use iot hub today for all your you know device uh telemetry at scale device management uh it's also yeah bring your own iot hub and augment that with azure digital twins and other data services and you're ready to go from a device perspective yeah absolutely excellent all right now in keeping with the rules here we're going to go with the ones that are voted the most first and uh we've got a new record here 12 and this again is from our friend oliver on the other side so this is and this is a great question by the way uh for azure digital twin how easy is it to integrate with 3d visuals for example using something like unity that's another great question so um so basically you know i always like to think of azure digital twins you know like if you're familiar with the model view controller paradigm mvc as a model component digital twins provides a real rich data model that provides lots of events whenever data flows through the system and when data changes and you can connect this with any sort of view that you you actually like so um many people use just dashboards as views where they basically represent state values coming from azure digital twins um in with controls and valves and gorgeous and and things like that other people take this data and apply it to a map and yet another set of people apply it to 3d data so through the event system in azure digital twins you can do push notifications for example using a service like signaller and drive data in push mode into an application like unity and then in your unity application you can use these events like you would use any other input event to make changes to your 3d scene change properties change visualizations and so on you can also use a pull mode where you run queries for example based on events happening in your 3d application where you run a query or a pull request from azure digital twins generally this is pretty easy the way how people typically do this is by keeping a reference to a twin and a 3d object and vice versa so that you basically have a bi-directional connection between a piece of geometry or a game object let's say in unity in your 3d scene and a twin on the azure digital twin side excellent well that's that's amazing that you can do that i want to say that sam's keynote had kind of an example uh that sort of sort of showed this with the mixer that we saw previously so um if you did catch the keynote there was a bit of an example of this that was that was sort of shown live there um so this is a great one i like this question because coincidentally we have a slide for it um so this one this and and that's i will go ahead and kick this one over to you because i think you can speak to this very well so what exactly has changed since the first version of adt aka the smart spaces uh implementation since it was first emphasized the notion of connected device devices um basically i think the gist of this question is what has changed since that first implementation of adt yeah oh great question uh we learned a lot from the the previous version i said at build we announced that we had the adt public preview refresh so we refreshed the capabilities and a lot of that was based on the learnings from that you know smart spaces focused version as was just asked i think the key differences really is around um flexible modeling so we talked about if he caught sam's keynote he talked about you know the digital twins definition language and while the previous version was very well suited for smart spaces um scenarios we did get a lot of feedback that customers wanted to model more they wanted to represent things other than buildings um so with this updated version we'll be using you know dtdl and the flexible modeling you can literally represent and model anything a people a place a thing a business system so that's definitely been one key piece of feedback that we did incorporate to again unlock a lot more use cases for customers and partners um and and then we also have feedback that the the tree the hierarchy to query for insights and uh in the tree was uh was maybe not sufficient for some of these other use cases that customers were seeing a lot of business value from so if you look at the refresh capabilities we now have a graph so it's more of a general you know flexible general graph topology and you can do you know more powerful queries with it as well to drive interesting insights for your business applications um another really good you know piece of feedback from developers was that um as you wanted to react to things that happened in the graph we had what we called user defined functions so you had to use javascript and you injected javascript you know into our api and that was the way to to basically set up set up compute we had feedback that you know developers wanted the language of choice they wanted better tooling better debugging for all these things so we have you know the refresh capabilities have a uh integration with azure functions so not only do you get the you know the same compute capabilities and you can write your business logic to react and respond to things as they happen in the graph but now you have first class support in terms of tooling language of choice debugging i mean everything that comes with azure you know azure functions from a developer experience perspective um another critical piece of feedback that you'll see with the updated refresh um developers customers love the fact that they could quickly get started but they wanted to do more with iot hub and they loved that it was feeding uh you know azure digital twins but they wanted to do the device management they wanted to do the command and control uh they wanted to do a lot more and we you know the previous version encapsulated the hub so it was not really accessible to to developers with the updated version we've moved to it bring your own iot hub model and that also means that for a lot of our customers who use iot hub heavily for all their device technology and device management ingestion at scale it's it's really an incremental step to take advantage of azure digital twins you don't have to start over and and that's been uh you know it's accelerated a lot of our you know customers who again not only wanted to quickly start with adt but also take advantage of all the the full power and capability of iot hub which the previous version prevented and then probably the biggest one is to our surprise or you know good surprise uh we had customers who were trying to go quickly to production i mean they were seeing great results and even though it was a public preview they really wanted to go deploy this to a lot of customers and they're driving a lot of great business and the the scale limits and targets we had at the time were not sufficient for you know the accelerated growth we saw from these customers and partners um so with the public preview refresh we've improved that you know leaps and bounds we have uh you know better architecture and we've we've published our scale targets uh in our public preview documentation but if you go take a look it is much much much better than what the previous version had and this refresh capabilities and this refreshed um product really sets up customers much better enough for going to production and actually deploying this to you know customers environments at scale so that's probably the biggest notable change from a you know production readiness perspective excellent and that was a that was a big answer of course a lot of different topics covered so if you do refer to the slide i think you can kind of pick out uh the majority of those topics that annes just covered here i think this one was kind of brushed on a little bit in your answer but maybe we can deep dive a little bit more um so michael hawkinson asks are there any plans to add azure digital twins as a selectable endpoint from the iot hub ah yeah uh great question christian or i guess i'll start yeah there's definitely um we do have on the roadmap plans to have um uh maybe uh better together integration for those some of these experiences so today it is already a great experience and you can pick the set of telemetry that you want from iot hub and you can use azure functions and other things to filter exactly what you need so you don't kind of spend your graph with a whole bunch of telemetry that you may not care about but we are looking at maybe adding a few more shortcuts again just to accelerate how quickly it is to connect those two services so that's something that's on our roadmap and we may end up doing it's a great feature ask question yeah i know christian if you wanted to add more i think you you answered that pretty completely excellent so uh we've got another good one here from dan um and i do want to proface this one let's let's try to be uh cognizant of any privacy concerns around any customers who this this story might be about but dan asks would you be able to share the most interesting maybe even unexpected scenario that you have seen digital twins used for hmm uh i think it was actually a customer at build and again won't share the the name but if i recall the most unique use case that i've heard about was the digital twin of a a human body because they wanted to kind of monitor the different implants and parts of the body whether it's like heart monitors or ear implants and yeah they wanted to create a digital swing solution of a human body including data from the various sensors that may be implanted in the body and again very interesting use case i that was a first um for me at least i don't know christian if you've heard more interesting anecdotes on them yeah for me actually the most interesting use cases that um people are starting to do are use cases that go beyond iot um where customers are starting to look at you know like um and actually sam um touched on that a little bit with the whole story you know from connected devices to connected environments where people start to use digital twins really as a design pattern to bring together data from all kind of different sources not just iot sources and model really fairly complex business processes and business relationships and all the real-time look on all of that and these use cases are super interesting because they go way beyond you know like the traditional ways to think about you know like streaming data from devices or anything like that and even the whole core idea of digital twins to contextualize data takes on a completely different meaning when you look at data you know like in a broader context than just iot so super interesting use cases in that word we have a customer who monitors cows with digital twins so the health of a whole cows which i find quite interesting and another customer is doing you know steel manufacturing so that's a case where pretty much every sensor measurement you get all of a sudden has temperatures you know like way beyond 2000 degrees which is kind of like fun to see when you see these dashboards yeah so christian's point uh we learn about new use cases every day so that's been the fun part of this journey that some of these capabilities are unlocking you know beyond um some of the more traditional use cases we may have thought about and that's been great to see that this technology is unlocking so many different business use cases um yeah excellent all right so we've got one here from uh george m uh or jorge i'm sorry if i'm if i'm mispronouncing that in iot device messaging at scale the use of more efficient data formats is often required for example avro and protobuf are commonly used instead of plain json are there any good examples of serialized format of the data in a digital twin interface so in in digital twins itself so because you know like the way how you drive data into digital twins is through rest api calls really um in the rest api call you basically make patch calls against uh digital twins so at that point you already will have resolved your device uh incoming format into into basically a rest api call and the format in the rest api call so at that point digital twins directly does actually not deal with the decoding of your on wire message formats that come from devices and when you interact with the azure digital twins apis basically the return data that you get is effectively json data that you get back from the rest api so again at the point where data arrives in digital twins it's already basically um jsonified if you if you will excellent that was that was a tough one there um i got another hard one for you so do you see use cases for azure digital twins v2 for creating simulation environments for deep reinforcement learning yeah that's actually something that we're seeing uh more and more and perhaps you have also heard about microsoft acquisition of bonsai um you know as a deep reinforcement machine teaching platform so um basically in in in that platform you do use simulation driven by um the machine learning system to basically figure out by throwing literally like lots and lots of input conditions at the simulator and then measuring the results from it how you actually get closer to the desired outcome and we see increasingly interest from customers to drive these sort of solutions through digital twins where digital twins basically takes the role of managing all the data transfer and the event handling that basically drives these simulations or drives bonsai to then in turn you know like drive the simulation environment and in the end the outcome of that process is often a machine learning model that then replaces some parts of the solution in operations open for efficiency and and cost effectiveness in in operations of it so um we're seeing this um more and more and we're definitely looking into that you know like to to make sure that all these use cases work very very smoothly for our customers yeah we also have uh send quick briefly mentioned ansys for example a great partner who is doing exactly that taking azure digital twins as that core layer that helps with all things modeling have a live graph keep things up to date and then leveraging their domain expertise on on simulation physics based simulation and kind of augmenting and leveraging adt to drive a lot of those scenarios yeah yeah and actually in exactly that scenario you can actually use something like bonsai as an intermediate platform where basically you drive a bonsai from data with data from digital twins and then that gets in turn basically simulated through ansys uh um so the ansys multiphysics simulator and uh so that you get really really interesting scenarios uh where you get highly optimized outcomes in the end so that is definitely very much a cutting-edge approach right now excellent and just for the audience out there if you are interested in learning more about this ansys solution there is a um a video on the iot show from olivier block where um he speaks with developers and they walk through that solution so uh try to look that one up we'll see if we can get someone to post a link to that in the announcements but um do tune in to the iot show if you are interested in more information on that particular implementation here's another interesting one this one is from anonymous uh will we have access to a graphical view of our digital twins environment so yeah we do actually have a sample application that is open source you find that under the name digital twins explorer in in github um that basically gives you a 2d visualization of the twins graph you have in digital twins you can run queries against that and play out with queries edit properties you can even create a twin scrap from scratch upload models to adt to you know customize your instance with your custom domain vocabulary and all these things it is a sample application so it's available fully in source code it's a javascript application um so it's it's right there customers and partners take it augment it contribute back so it's definitely it's open source and um yeah open to contributions and ideas and and how to make it better as well yeah and we're planning we're planning a lot of new work on this over the next few months so there will be lots of new stuff there excellent all right we got one here from yuri are there plans to allow the live execution environment into iot central yeah um that's a great question it's definitely on the roadmap and we'll probably have more to share in the coming months but again um having adt continue to nicely integrate all these various azure services is uh is critical based on you know customer feedback so yeah stay tuned nothing to announce today on that front but it's definitely on the roadmap yeah excellent um here's one that's that gains some popularity really fast uh eight up votes here uh do you consider geo redundancy and multi-region scenarios for azure digital twins short answer short answer yes so um we're looking at all these scalability and reliability scenarios so there's a lot of work going on in this yes yep [Music] oh wow we've got yet another one here uh from oliver uh where would you recommend that a newbie goes to learn all about azure digital twins like you're you're new to all this you don't know what it is where's the best place to start yeah um i think so the best place to start is um go to our azure docs um and we'll share the link um uh you know at the end of this session but we actually do have a great set of small you know tutorials how to's uh we have one really basic sample that again if you're just getting started it kind of walks you through some of the basic apis it lets you play around as christian talked about we have the adt explorer that's also a great tool to get started because it lets you also visually interact with the graph and see how things kind of come together and i think just you know as a developer looking at samples you know changing code here and there looking at it conceptually and visually as you're playing with the adt explorer sample those are what i would recommend as kind of the best place to start in addition to definitely go look at some of the customer stories because another place for getting started is people ask well what kind of use cases or business problems can i solve with this technology and those customer stories and some of the customer stories in the iut show are great concrete examples of what some of our customers and partners have built and it can really give you some really concrete ideas on the types of problems you can also go solve excellent see i i will mirror that and say that i think docs.microsoft.com the documentation is a great place to start but also if you're interested in an interactive way to learn all about azure digital twins i had the pleasure of viewing um pamela cortez has a deep dive iot series that features uh christian and if we can get a link to that in the announcements i thought that it was just wonderful it was an hour long it literally went through everything um answering quite a few of the questions the fact that have come up here so show the visualization how to get started how it all works under the hood really everything that you need to know so uh i do not know the title off the top of my head but we will try to get that published into the announcements so uh i do regret to inform everyone that we are coming at the end of time for our session um now i will leave you with a number of resources here if you do view the slide deck currently um there is a collection of modules that we have on microsoft learn where you can interactively learn about these topics for yourself uh similarly we've got links to the digital twins product overview which will give you a nice brief uh description on how to use all this as well as additional links out to relevant things like documentation if you're interested in learning about anything else pertaining to iot here at ignite we've got an excellent post up on the iot tech community that can be found at aka ms iot ignite 2020 and i'd like to plug pamela's deep dives yet again uh at the very end here you can find all of them at aka dot ms slash iot slash deep dive that includes the one with christian that tells you everything you need to know about azure digital twins so before we sign off here i just want to say thank you and ask and christian for joining us on on on ignite 2020 answering our questions live from our audience um in this virtual hangout of ours and again um we're so pleased to have you all attend here and really appreciate you taking the time to provide the questions so we can't wait to learn what you guys build with guys and gals build with the azure digital twin service and would love to hear all about it so feel free to tell us on twitter you know if you've got anything awesome that's in the works you can hit us up olivier block paul de carlo pamela cortez uh all of us are all constantly monitoring we'd love to hear what you're building so until next time we'll see you soon thank you bye everyone bye thank you
