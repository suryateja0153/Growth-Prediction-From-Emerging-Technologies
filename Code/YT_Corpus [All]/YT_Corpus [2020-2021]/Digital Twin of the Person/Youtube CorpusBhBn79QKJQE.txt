 [Music] well i would like to officially welcome everyone to this 14th live session in the covid advocacy exchange we are deeply deeply honored to be back together and to see how far we've come just since starting this program earlier this year um i will be honest preparing for today's session has really really affected me it's given me a deeper understanding of the ways that the issues we're going to talk about affect people and it has certainly helped me gain more empathy to the ways we are affected in these different areas and so before i turn it over to a man that i respect tremendously for his character and his work i would like to start by asking everyone a question if i may the question for you is how would you like things to be different after today and how would you like to be different as we go through these conversations i encourage you to please keep that idea in your mind because these will be some powerful and really authentic conversations and at the end before we wrap we're gonna have a specific call to action for the change that we want to see and we want to create together going forward so without any further ado i am deeply deeply honored to introduce john diamante who is the president of the bms foundation hello john hello dave and uh thank you and good morning and good afternoon and good evening everyone it's a real pleasure and honor to be able to uh take a few minutes to uh make some opening comments on this very important uh topic and you know i had a conversation i have twin 16 year old girls and um so i told them what i was doing today and they say well that's interesting um what are you going to talk about and i said well i'm actually going to talk about the lessons that we learned working on health equity over the past 20 years and they said you know that sounds like something old people would do and i said well you know i think you're right and actually you know i think i'm too old to have 16 year old daughters that's the problem so anyway what i'm actually going to do is exactly that i'd like to kind of go back and talk about some of the early lessons we learned working on health equity and health disparities um in sub-saharan africa in 1999 and the reason i feel comfortable going back to a time that fortunately isn't a time that we experience now um dealing with hiv on the continent is that you know we learned so many lessons early on that actually have fundamentally become um kind of like the foundation of what the bristol myers whip foundation does in all of our programming globally we never tend to veer from the concepts that we learned back then and if you just bear with me for five to ten minutes i just want to take you through some of those lessons you know actually as i had mentioned we started in sub-saharan africa in 1999 right so let's think back to what um hiv on the continent was like 90 um of all of the hiv cases were in sub-saharan africa um and unlike the develop world where we had multiple combinations of drugs and we actually were able to turn it into a chronic condition drug was just not available in sub-saharan africa so here comes the bristol-myers squibb foundation our company who was a global leader in in hiv decides that we are going to make a landmark commitment to really help support um sub-saharan african countries in the development of infrastructure and capacity to address hiv so interestingly enough here comes the bristol meyer squib foundation we have a commitment of 100 million dollars um over five years now doesn't sound like a lot of money in the face of an epidemic but if you think back to 1999 it was before the gates foundation was involved in global health it was before pepfar it was before the global fund and that hundred million dollars was actually the largest private commitment of its kind so we went to a part of the world that we actually did not have much experience in terms of the work the foundation was doing and unfortunately the way many of those countries and initially the five southern most african countries of south africa lesotho namibia botswana and swaziland now eastwatini were also not only the countries that had the highest hiv infection rates but also probably the most politicized so here we come 100 million dollars from the bristol myers squibb foundation and most of those countries would look at us and say um you know what um bristol-myers squib is not a philanthropy company it's a pharmaceutical company and what we really need is drug at affordable pricing not your philanthropy and it was a difficult discussion because they were absolutely right and while the company was working on the actual pricing of pharmaceuticals and hiv compounds so they could be more readily available in this part of the world and prior to then all the multilateral bilateral and national governments to be able to support it we were there to help build the capacity and to help really build infrastructure so when that drug was available it could be effectively delivered so what they were basically saying to us in a sense was do we really trust you or are you actually looking to create a market to spend to sell and expensive hiv products into so the first thing we started to do is at the end of the day the most important thing was to build trust with our constituents those were patients those were treating organizations community-based organizations those were especially the ministries of health of the five countries and what did we do to actually help move that along the first thing we did is that we hired completely colored and black african staffs to run the program this program we had decided was not going to be run from 345 park avenue in new york or princeton new jersey it was going to be run in sub-saharan africa it was going to be run by africans for african solutions and that whole forward-facing approach to having individuals from the local markets and the local organizations and the local countries being our lead and being the conveners and being the implementers went a very very long way to building that trust okay so i just take a look now if we fast forward where let's say bristol-myers good foundation is um with one of our new commitments the whole issue of trying to recruit diverse populations and minority populations into clinical trials in the u.s is quite a challenge and a lot of people are working at the community based level to really try to do that to make sure we have the right representation in trials the foundation said let's take a long-term approach because this whole concept of building trust with the individuals you have to interact right interact with is critical so we have just recently made a 100 million dollar commitment to train 250 diverse clinical investigators um in the united states over a five-year period and to also provide 250 underrepresented minority medical students the opportunity to be mentored by these young investigators the concept is we want individuals to build a trust and recruit patients who actually look like them it's a fundamental understanding of how we think about our programs whether it's in clinical diversity whether it's in our programs around the world is to really build that representation so first lesson make sure your organization looks like the populations you're looking to serve you know not exclusively but make sure you have that representation to build that trust part two of the whole african experience was the ability for us to try to really look at building a transparent program again a lot of suspicion a lot of mistrust um so we created like many of you do advisory boards and we went out and actually developed advisory boards on the community side on the treating side and especially on the governmental side those were some of the most difficult discussions we've ever had i mean they were very hostile at times um it's nothing you know presenting on panels or anything nothing like being shouted down in terms of your intentions and there was a lot of discussion at bristol myers squibb at the time to say you know what this is very difficult you know perhaps we should pack up the tents and maybe we should move to west africa where it won't be so politicized but the ability for us to stay there with local with local staffs and to start to build that trust went a very very very long way so i guess one of the things that's really interesting is you know where we were in 1999 in 2000 where the ministries were very suspect of who we are two years after that um at a world aids conference being on a panel with bristol myers squibb and our partners about how to build effective public-private partnerships so end of the day you know what lean into discomfort because when you want to move the needle you have to hear all the voices and be transparent one of the more important things that we learned early on back in the early days of secure the future as the program was called back then was the role that communities play um in a factory in effectively delivering um medical innovation and care right so it's interesting we had back in the day two distinct advisory groups one worked specifically on looking at the operational research and care for treatment and the other program on the other side of the room actually focused on community outreach and education we learned rather quickly that whatever those physicians and researchers came up with in terms of how do you effectively treat in resource limited settings never had any sort of traction unless the community was fully engaged in bringing that to their constituents you know we always kind of think about that whole concept we used to call it at the time you know the half hour in the clinic versus the 23 and a half hour of the person's day when they step foot out of the clinic and where the challenge begins and we all know that back in the day in the hiv side it wasn't a half hour in the clinic and the 23 and a half hours in the day it was the half hour in the clinic and the six months when they're in the community it was critical to actually develop community support structures that could actively and effectively work with the health care system so that individuals can really benefit i mean many many times in sub-saharan africa it wasn't the fact that they wanted drug they'd rather be able to eat than actually take medication and we all knew that on those medications you actually have to be able to eat so how do you really start to think about community-based gardens and mobilization and bringing those non-traditional players to the table fundamentally if you take a look at the bristol meyer squib foundation work over the years it all comes down to the same thing how do you think about bringing down the barriers that exist within a health system right so health system strengthening and how do you effectively tie that to community mobilization and support and understanding at times that you know what the medical community doesn't always effectively understand how to speak and work with community health they know how to treat individual patients but how do they treat communities and that's a lot of investment that we have to put in but it's really essential when we think about health disparities and and health equity how we bring those two together and in many cases having to invest in the development of human resource capacity to make that all work early on many of the organizations we were working with on the ground were nascent organizations many had trans kind of kind of evolved from the apartheid side and they weren't very strong organizations institutionally but they were passionate they were smart and they were integrated and for us in many cases you could have easily walked away from those organizations and said you know what i don't think i can fund this organization internal audit's going to be going off the wall but the thing is we actually put the resourcing into those organizations those non-sort of traditional organizations to do it and i think one really needs to think about where we are on covert vaccination and we think about covet acceptance we've gotten good news about that happening but there's also a lot of resistance about about vaccination and i think it's the whole concept that we need to think about now with all our partners regardless of the therapeutic areas you work in that you really need to think about vaccination acceptance and how we could bring those non-traditional players to the table it'll be the pharmaceutical industries and the research centers that'll discover the drug or the vaccine it'll be health care practitioners developing the vaccination it has to be the community that's going to open the door so those individual patients can walk through it and that needs to start now not when it's ready to be delivered in six to eight months so again communities are essential to everything the other thing is be realistic in goal-setting you know when we started off early i think we tried to do a bit too much and i think we sort of disenfranchised a number of partners that we were bringing along so the thing is you know basically be focused be focused around what's realistic in your strategy and you know what if you're going to fail fail early fail quick change course and get on with it i mean all too long people want to drag things out because they made public commitments hoping they can correct things if you can't correct it cut your losses realign and get going again and then finally you know one of the things that we always continue to understand as we continue to learn um as we go forward so you know always seek to understand and engage on the structural barriers that really stand in the way of health equity i think 2020 brought to light more around what structural issues around institutional racism can actually have on the on the how should i say it on the sustainability of what we do we can run you know multi-year sort of demonstration programs with the intent that we're actually going to be able to demonstrate that these could be effectively picked up by government by hospital systems but if we're working in a system where we see inherit racism how far do these programs go i mean is it just that we've invested all this money and all this m e and all this advocacy to help 250 people in a study um or are we really going to take a look at what stands in the way of making that successful you know i'm going to just finish up by saying that you know i also have responsibility at the bristol myers squibb company for patient assistance and one of the things we have is a patient assistance foundation and if you come to the patient assistance foundation and you cannot afford your drug you will get that drug free of charge for as long as you need that that product and that's pretty much consistent among most pharmaceutical companies in the u.s we had a patient at an advisory board meeting talk about his sort of journey to get to a patient assistance foundation i mean the bottom line is just having a mechanism like a patient assistance foundation does not actually guarantee access you have to think about all those structural barriers that stand in a patient's way to actually even get to the front door of that of that foundation to make a request for drug or that individual's doctor think about those structural barriers make sure you challenge your partners on those structural barriers who are the partners that are saying they can actually help you do that what do they look like internally you kind of go back to the second point about leaning into discomfort and um and some of these difficult discussions have them it's going to make a huge difference and i just want to say in closing that you know like many of you we spent much of our time over the past 20 years um working on supporting community health workers um and frontline workers on all of these issues and i just want to kind of point out that it's sort of heartwarming living in new york city that during you know the covet peak here in manhattan to actually hear people cheering on frontline healthcare workers so they're the best invest in them pray for him and let's do our work so i thank you for listening to my rants for a while and let me turn it back to dave thank you john very much um what you you said that really touched me is the leaning into discomfort that's the heart of authenticity and i know that i was raised to be you know polite and not rock the boat too much and with these issues we have to be open to those conversations and leaning into discomfort and i just love how well you said that thank you so i'm going to turn it yeah of course thank you john i'm going to turn it quickly to our next speaker uh perry hokitis who is the director of rutgers center for health identity behavior and prevention studies uh perry i will let you go right into the important stuff you're going to share thank you let me mute myself um kristen let's not start the slides quite yet i actually just wanted to reflect on a couple things that john said because i um um unlike dave i actually i was raised to be polite too but you know as a child of immigrants i was learning to also to be forceful and to speak my mind so i want to just reflect on a couple things that john said i think that as we challenge the systems that we're all facing with we have to first and foremost own the fact that our that our health care system has been rooted in white cisgender male patriarchal hierarchy for decades centuries since six you know for 401 years and unless we change how the power is shared in health care in pharmaceutical industry in schools of public health nothing's going to get better and it's not our job to like bring care to people and just dump it on them but it is our job to work with communities as equal partners they know as much about their communities know as much about their health as we do and so one of the things that we have been proposing at the school of public health where i'm also the dean is a a modern public health paradigm which marries the work of industry with community with government and with academic public health to actually affect the change because unless folks are all at the table together having a conversation we're going to continue to have the problems whether it be coping 19 or hiv which by the way in our country hiv still affects 40 000 people a year mostly black men you know who are gay so the the structural barriers the structural inequities are perpetuated not just in continents beyond our own but certainly in our own in our own country and you just don't need to look very very far to see even in my hometown here in newark of what's going on with health with health issues so i i challenge my students every day to be at activists and i challenge you to be activists it's not enough to be an academic it's not enough to be a scientist it's not enough to be an educator in this particular moment it's time to be an activist because as we have seen over the course of the last four years politics shape public health and if if we don't challenge the politics that continue to marginalize and oppress we're not going to see an improvement in anybody's health in this country blast point kristen and i dr krauss and i i'm sorry about that kristen dr krauss and i are going to be talking about lgbtq health issues in covet i just want to start also by saying let's um i also challenge us to stop thinking about people living in one box because gay people are black people and black people are immigrants and immigrants are people from new york city and people from new york city are stall like everybody has intersectional identities and so to assume that everybody fits squarely in one box oh here's the lgbtq people and their this is their reality you know it's different from the black people and here's their reality it's like this very very it reminds me of those schools that continue to have cultural awareness months instead of undoing social studies so that every culture is praised and honored all throughout the year as my wonderful husband is doing in new york city teaching social studies to middle high school to middle school kids okay so i'm done with my tirade now now we can go to the slides and so we're going to talk to you today about our research center chips which has been you know which was a center that i founded at nyu some 20 years ago i was at nyu for 20 like 19 years and i've been here at rutgers for the last three and a half years my blood has changed from you know velvet what is it violet to scarlet and so i am fully embedded in our new you know my new institution and the center that we have founded uh is is is a really critical element of the work we're going to talk about today we're going to also talk about lgbtq people in general and their health talk about a study we've just enacted you are the first to see the data from the study and let me just say this as an applied statistician as somebody who's a phd in applied statistics i just want to say we're going to show you very simple simple simple data today there are more sophisticated analysis to be done so so just you know this is the first pass-through that we wanted to share with you go on christian so our center the goal of our center is to improve the lives of those people uh affected by multiple intersecting health problems including hiv substance use using both social science and public health research approaches and next slide we work with with and for the population so at the school of public health we have adopted a slogan keeping the public in public health because i will tell you very honestly when i first arrived at rutgers about three and a half years ago public health is being done behind computers and that's not the way i do public health uh public health needs to be done actively with advocacy and activism in the community and so we work with and for the communities and populations that we study and i use the word both communities and populations because i think populations consist of communities and people can can be in many communities and in many populations and again this intersecting notion of all of these things and the work that we do is highly translational so you know while we do everything we can to get our work out into the scientific literature we also write up ads and go to meetings and like go to to go to events where we share in real time like this event right here what's going on with our studies next slide please um the the program that we've developed also and kristin is the deputy kristin starts working with me at nyu and then she is paul eventually came with me to rutgers and just finished with her phd so she's uh my first graduate from rutgers um a big part of the of what we do is develop the next generation of scholars and so i'm almost 58 years old and so i don't know how much longer i'm going to be doing this but i know what my responsibility is and what my responsibility has been over the last 20 years which is to make sure that that that i as best as possible create a new generation of scholars who are going to take the work to a whole other level and hopefully do it even better than i'm doing it right now next slide please so we currently have three studies that we're doing related to covid19 the first that we're going to talk about today are lgbtq cobot survey which completed last july a study called chronicle which is a study of um individuals living with hiv with regard to their experiences of covet and tapping into a resilience versus a deficit model trying to understand how hiv-positive people are living with through this era which where some people as christian will tell you is for them as the second pandemic in their lives and do they have the tools from their first pandemic to manage the second it's all very interesting and as all of you know very well the literature about covid19 and hiv and entry virals is really complicated and is it protective is it not protective it's a very complicated situation for hiv but i will say to you that what we are seeing is that hiv positive people who we might have think who we have might have thought were highly vulnerable to covet 19 into mortality are not manifesting in the way we had expected at the beginning of the epidemic and finally a study on serial prevalence of antibodies in newark in essex county where we are doing time space sampling and doing testing at bodegas and supermarkets and big box stores to look at antibody presence uh given all its limitations and we know there's limitations with antibody testing um in the population to get a better sense of exposure next slide please so um you know i'm building on also what john said and i think this taps into it very very well you know too often the work we've done has been rooted in a biomedical perspective the smart doctors come and help the people right and my perspective is rather a biopsychosocial perspective which believes that any disease absolutely has a biological basis but it also has a social structural basis and a behavioral psychological basis and if we think about hiv in particular we can think about coping 19 too if hiv was purely a viral viral pathogen then it would equally affect every population in the united states but it doesn't and those who are most marginalized because of their race or their sexual orientation are the ones who are most affected and the same pattern emerges for cobia 19. so in order to affect the change uh in a really really important way in the health of people you have to attack the virus you have to attack the disease on all three fronts much like we attach attack hiv with a triple combination treatment next slide please the other thing that i really believe in and hold dear to my heart is this notion that diseases don't exist separate from each other so where you see covet you see hiv and where you see hiv you see addiction where you see is extremely mental health burden disease we try to treat people like this so they have only one disease but in fact people have what we have talked about in literature for 40 years as comorbidities i call it syndemic and this endemic is an idea that that the health conditions coexist and they exacerbate each other and when you have one health condition it makes the other health condition worse next slide please and finally and importantly this notion of intersectionality which divides all the work that we do recognizing that the people we study yes our research center is focused mostly on lgbtq plus individuals and in fact krishna will tell you that we were recently asked to write an article about the health of the population i said i need i need six chapters i don't need one chapter the chapter on l is different from the chapter from g and b and t and q and so um i i say that also trying to to point out the fact that in this lgbtq population there's there's not it's not a monolith so folks across their sexual orientation and gender identity are not the same and they also bring to the table their race their culture their ethnicity their nation of birth all of these issues that define who they are and so focusing on the role that intersectionality and healthcare delivery is really key next slide please and so kristen's now going to take us through uh just a brief summary about the health of lgbt population and then we're going to dive right into the study findings for you and i'm going to highlight the word brief so this is also stuff we can discuss further in the breakout rooms but thank you again for having us um and i can't control my own slides go figure um so one of the one of the challenges that we have within this field of lgbt health sexual and gender minority health whatever you want to call it is that today we we don't have an accurate estimate um both here in the us and and more important globally of how many lgbtq people there are um this is for many reasons one of the biggest is that especially here in the us um questions around good questions around sexual orientation and gender identity are not included in these massive surveys such as the census and the american community health survey um so what we're often then forced to do is kind of compile these other surveys like breakfast the behavioral health surveys and and we're kind of compiling all these numbers together and what we believe is an estimate so you know according to gallup our most recent estimate is that there's close to 11 million lgbt individuals in the us uh i'm sure perry and i would would argue that this it's it's much more than that um also contextualizing the fact that you know any identity within this umbrella that we're talking about lies on a spectrum and so folks don't necessarily fit into one box or another um at one point in their life and and may transform their identities over time and so with that um within this community as a whole we see that there's many different health conditions that perry has already mentioned that tend to are more exasperated so within um lesbian gay and bisexual men and women we see that there's overall you know self-rated health is is less compared to their heterosexual counterpoint counterparts we see higher levels of different chronic illnesses um a a younger age of onset for disability and this is you know this is a common theme weaved throughout all of these these subgroups that we mentioned um and specifically for our trans folks and trans non-binary folks there's a whole other set of issues and again it's important for us to to contextualize that sexual orientation is not the same thing as gender identity even though we it often gets thrown into this umbrella um sexual orientation is is rooted in attractionality and gender identity is rooted in an individual being and identifying with your sex assigned at birth so for our trans folks we see health challenges around use of hormones we see increased prevalence of an incidence of cancer often associated with biological gender but often associated as well with any type of hormone replacement therapy gender transition we the the data is still very slim on that um and many of these other mental health and psychosocial challenges substance use depression anxiety higher levels of sti so many things that you would think would impact these communities definitely are and so when we think about how this relates to kovid there's been a slew of advocates including perry and myself and many of our colleagues around the country in the world you know really concerned about what the impact of kovid is is having on on our communities and so we put together this survey um back literally almost two weeks after the onset where we started planning it and i'm going to turn this back over to perry in a minute but we really wanted to do our best to get a you know a represented representative u.s sample um looking very briefly at behavior around sexual behavior substance use um employment testing all of that kind of stuff in relation to covid so i'm going to turn this back over to perry so he can introduce the study a little bit more yeah and we did so thanks kristen and you know we did a study after the pulse shootings also in a very similar way where we were able to really see that the pulse shootings actually made lgbtq people much more afraid of their for their safety and their well-being something that we publish that is accessible to all of you um you know um so we come to this work you know with this you know very clear notion again this is the syndemic that that covert 19 cannot be thought about in the lgbtq population separate from all of these other issues like stis and co-infections and malnutrition mental health and violence and what have you um and that all of these all of these health problems are fueled by these structural inequalities including food insecurity and poverty and homophobia and you know lgbtq people are not rich you know there's this notion that somehow lgbtq people are rich but lgbt people are often people who work in service industry who have who have um you know you know minimum wage paying jobs who have been affected by cobit 19. and again the diversity exists within the population so that it is not this the experience of a white gay man who is a who is a dean of a school of public health and you know at you know at a university is very different from the experience of somebody who doesn't have all of those benefits and all of those privileges and so again really important to think about the structural inequities that exist not only in the population at large but in the population of lgbtq people sexual and gender minority people more broadly next slide please and so we did a very very very very we turned it around really quickly we did two waves of data collection and i'll tell you why we did two waves because in the first wave because we were incentivizing people we identified bots who were taking our survey which we've seen since cleaned up so we we we cleaned up that data and then we did another version in june from june to july to be in our study individuals had to be over 18 identify as lgbtq and live in the u.s or u.s territory which were able to verify we did a really decent job in the stretched out united states here um it's really stretched out isn't it uh and it stretched out united states here to get everyone from almost every state except which one kristin some red state wyoming yeah except for one but wyoming um but we did a very good job in getting people from almost everywhere as you can see from here we ended up with 1090 participants diverse in terms of their age less diverse unfortunately in terms of their race ethnicity but there wasn't we really tried really hard and diverse in terms of these other issues with you know close to 40 from the northeast 11 12 from the midwest 20 from the south 10 from the mountain area 16 from the pacific and 3 from the non-contiguous united states so a snapshot there of what we accounted so again you are the first people to see this so we asked them a set of questions and what you see at the bottom is have you had a pcr test have you had an antibody test were you a p were you pcr positive and were you antibody positive and you see pretty consistently that there's no differentiation across race both for pcr and serology there is a trend towards significance for the pcr positivity with latinx people you know indicating um a higher rate of infection at 19 similarly in terms of antibody positivity again bearing in mind that antibody positivity unlike most people my antibodies continue to persist nine months into it for some reason most people lose their antibodies at the time of testing of these individuals uh black folks and you know had a and and white folks about equal proportions of antibodies present showing exposure of the disease across all aspects of the population and i want to say something also here that i think hearkens back to hiv at the beginning of the hiv epidemic we saw a disease in the united states that was spread along the socio-economic spectrum that but since that time in 40 years has lodged itself at the low end of the socio-economic spectrum i i i think that that the kova 19 is doing that at a much much more accelerated rate just like it's killing people at a much more accelerated rate next slide please in terms of sexual orientation we also asked them about whether they tested and what their results were and what we find here is that gay and the gay and lesbian population have not only had a higher uh higher chances of testing for antibodies but significantly more likely that pcr positive results and when you break it down you disentangle the gay from the lesbian it actually turns out that it is this number of 15 for pcr positive is being dominated primarily by gay men next slide please we also looked at differences in terms of gender identity and here we see once again a tendency of gay men and trans women to more likely to have had an antibody test than others next slide please and in terms of hiv serial status not surprising hiv-positive people who are very very very very conscious of their health because they have to be conscious of their health slightly elevated rates of pcr testing significantly more serology testing because they wanted to know if they'd been exposed and with this with this data that's coming out about about cd4 interactions whether it's cd4 diminishing or cd4 activating i think heavy positive people have an area for a particular concern with regard to covet 19. next slide please and in terms of nation of birth what we see here and here's how it plays out again in terms of you know immigrant immigrants in the united states and in terms of you know likely what their jobs are what we see here is that non-us individuals more likely to have 12 pcr testing in serology testing probably because they're more likely to have frontline workers this is an interpretation that we will have to bear out through the analyses and in terms of geography here again the north this at the time of our survey the northeast was being was the parts of the world that we were most talking about more likely to have a serology test next slide please and in terms of employment status here also what we found is that people who were employed full-time again hypothesis here that these individuals are full-time workers frontline staff not just healthcare providers right but ups ups workers and united states postal service workers and delivery people the people the unforgotten the forgotten heroes because we tend to like we bang the pots and pans for the doctors but we don't bang the pots and pans for the post for the post people and i think we need to bang them for all of those people but they are testing they're having pcr testing and serology testing at higher rates likely because they are more likely to also more likely to have been exposed next slide please and here is a breakdown of the cisgender gay men in our study almost 20 percent reported having a pcr positive test one in five gay men in this study reported being pcr positive which as you will know from the the prevalence data in the united states is much much higher close to 40 percent reported having antibodies so gay men see of all the populations and trans women to some extent within this sample to have been the most affected and most um impacted by covenant 19 and this again has to be borne out and we need to figure out what the reasons are that it's actually manifesting this way in this segment of the sexual and gender minority population a lot to like chew on here so one of my other favorite things that we started to look at is we looked at section drugs um after and before uh coven 19 and we mark march 13th as the beginning as the as demarcation point um we're not going to show you sex data but i'm sad to report that there's less sex um since march 13th um sorry but there's more drug use and so what you see here in this chart on the left and the green and yellow is that um 82 percent of individuals reported alcohol use in the past year but um if you combine more and the same about 79 more are the same with close to um uh with close to a third of the popular of the sample indicating was they were relying on alcohol much more before the in since since copen 19 than before a phenomenon that also next slide plays out when we look at tobacco use another drug that we tend to forget here i'm looking i'm looking at the state-sanctioned drugs here because we always talk about cocaine and meth and all that other stuff right all that bad stuff but in fact when you look at hiv and other things alcohol is one of the biggest facilitators of hiv transmission it's not just meth you know um what we see here is you know you know close to 40 again more tobacco use in the next one um close to 40 more marijuana use you know since the onset of the pandemic so i think what you are hearing in the literature is very true to what we're seeing here which is that folks are turning to substance use in the absence of other you know strategies in order to be able to cope and would certainly playing out in the lgbtq population um you know i it will be interesting to see what's happening with the other drugs i think it is much harder probably to access other drugs that are not state sanctioned because of having to go out on the street to get them or have them delivered to your home and how that is interfered by because of the um um of the um of the pandemic but um we'll we'll look at that analysis too i just wanted to add one more thing before i turn it um over to kristen which is you know i think it's really critically important as we continue to like i just did a whole thing with nj spotlight about thanksgiving uh could you all like to stay home please and like not stop spurring the disease that's my first request to you and number two um the vaccines are going to work effectively and get to people who need it if the administration that is currently in the white house continues to like delay their transition to the new administration so every day that a delay happens more americans die last but not least it is my great hope under a new federal administration that we will actually have um demographic data on whether what somebody's gender identity and sexual orientation is i went to a meeting a few months ago and said oh somebody said to me oh sexual education that's a social determinant and i'm like no it's a demographic so we need to shift our mindset to gather data on sexual orientation and gender identity like we do age and height and weight and race and everything else and so i encourage all of you to fight for that because we need to look at what the intersections are that actually affect the health of the population i'll turn over to kristin thank you um so he stole my next slide so i'll skip over that but okay um but you know just some general implications and again we can talk about these more in the breakout rooms but um really understanding what the the impact in the intersection of coven 19 with with every other health outcome and disparity that impacts these communities and really making sure that healthcare providers and practitioners are are tending to a holistic perspective of health and not just a mental health or physical health um and as perry kind of just alluded to there's very inconsistent collection of demographic information on cova testing forms and so if you're not even asking folks what their sexual orientation or gender identity might be or sex assigned at birth we have no absolutely no way of telling on a from a 10 000 foot view epidemiologically what the impact is on on these communities christian and i worked really hard over the course of the summer like we like strike as we sweated it out to get to get health care in you know in if you go to new york city which is like you know my birth place and that place that i go back to on the weekends um you and you go to the doctor they they assess your sexual orientation and your gender identity at the doctor's office we're not doing that in new jersey except for a few places so we need to push really really hard to do this in new jersey too because i think what we're going to see in another state that we're doing right now is that a lot of folks in new jersey who identify as a sexual gender minority are going to philly in new york to get their care because they don't think they can get their care here in new jersey and we need to normalize it okay keep going chris well this is this is countrywide too so when i wrote a commentary this summer only seven states had been had implemented any type of widespread rule and regulation for this so again this also kind of comes back to the census and american community survey you know it's really unfortunate that now we have to say like maybe in 2030 um because that's 10 years from now so um but more more to come on that so we just wanted to make sure that folks had some of our favorite resources the fenway institute for those of you who aren't familiar is one of the leading uh you know high-level research policy organizations uh involving all things lgbtq health um and some additional resources but i'll let perry talk about this this little gem of ours real quick so yeah very quickly so and a shout out to bms for their support of this also so two years ago kristen and i were sitting but so i don't know where we were sitting we were but we were bemoaning the fact that there was no public health journal focused on lgbtq health there were a lot of psychology journals and stuff you like humanistic journals so you know what do you do when you have like you know all the time in the world which we don't is you create a new journal and so we have and we launched it last year and its first volume has been a huge success and um it is available for free it is free available to for free for everyone for the first two years and thanks to the efforts of paul shea and others through the support of bristol meyer squibb we are going to continue to be able to work on this journal we have a coveted issue coming out in issue 4 in the next month i also have this really cool editorial in this one about politics and public health that i encourage you to read and then last but not least when i first came to the school also i gathered my faculty in the and i said well can we think about an lgbtq health concentration so because you know or uh uh um sorry not a certificate knowing that you know the issues of lgbtq people are complex and very and they came back and said no we don't need a certificate you don't need you can't learn everything in two classes or the four hours most medical doctors get about lgbtq people but you actually need a whole concentration so we have the world's first lgbt concentration in public health so please spread the word about that um and um thanks to everyone um and here's our oh that's my old bitmoji girl uh anyway so here's our bitmojis here's how you can get to us thank you very much for the opportunity to be here with you it's been it's been awesome oh my god perry kristen i'm just going to echo the power of the comments um your presentation is incredible um we are going to make a change to the agenda because there's more here than we can give justice to in the amount of time so let's go right into um our next uh panelist and patty if we could just have you say hi and then i'll let everybody know what the change is after we do a couple more intros sure sure hi everyone and thank you so much dave and the grit team and of course our colleagues at bms for inviting me and john to be part of this um i'll be hosting a breakout today along with steve kramer talking about health equity which really has three definitions that we're going to be paying attention to one is certainly outcomes that optimal health has achieved for all people but how do you get there so also assuring the conditions that will allow for optimal health and then finally i think what has now become much more broadly understood and embraced is the social justice aspect that everyone deserves a fair and just opportunity for optimal health that it's not fair that many people are suffering unnecessarily with completely preventable certainly reducing the you know disease burn that could be much less if we really just committed to quality health care for all and great public health as well stephen can we have you say hi and introduce yourself hello my name is stephen with a v for victory i'm a pharmacy student at st louis college of pharmacy i'm learning sign language to better communicate with the deaf and hard of hearing uh four years i'm really excited to be here and be a part of everyone coming together four years ago i had the opportunity to work with an 11 year old his biological family wasn't able to give him the support he needed as a deaf person so for the first 11 years of his life he had no language he couldn't read write talk sign liberty he didn't even know his name obviously no language means no friends and it was just really devastating to see a human being in that state just live like that thankfully he was adopted by another family and all seven of them learned sign language to communicate with him and it completely changed his life it was just so exciting he knew he learned his name he was able to make friends and just i had the opportunity to watch his transformation over the course of the year and it was just so exciting and my desire is to make sure that happens to all of my patients as a future pharmacist it's steven with the v for victory where uh the e before the v stands for educate i want to educate health care providers on accessibility for people with disabilities and then the second e stands for empower i want to empower people with disabilities to be advocates for their health and to do that i invite people from the deaf community as well as people with disabilities to give presentations and that i kind of wanted to show i brought my posters i have these around the campus so they come and educate the pharmacy students on ex how to better advocate for people with disabilities and then i collaborate with snafus student national pharmaceutical association with in partner with centers for independent living and we go out into the community and then educate and empower the community with what we learned at the school so yes i'm really excited to be here yay thank you oh yeah what you say is true so this is the sign for applause so yay [Music] stephen you are the embodiment of collaboration and co-creation we didn't know each other a couple of months ago and you are a new miracle in my life i was scrolling through facebook trying to see how do i do uh virtual health fairs because of covid and then on facebook it popped up and it was like come to the covet advocacy exchange and i was like oh yeah that sounds exciting so and i reached out to dave i attended uh one of his covert advocacy events and then we met and i told him my story and he was like yes let's collaborate and i'm so yes as i said i am very excited to be here that's wonderful and kami we're going to change the format so please don't feel any need to rush at all just go right in and do your introduction okay i was wondering that as well but um hi everybody my name is kemi ocean dina and i have the wonderful privilege of working at bms uh with many of my colleagues on the call today and i work on our u.s oncology patient advocacy team working with representatives from organizations similar to many of you on the call today so really honored to to speak on this call today and talk about this important topic um you know uh i'll be co-leading a breakout well i'm not sure if we're still having the breakouts but the topic of our breakout was copic 19 specifically the impact on racial and ethnic uh minorities and how those disparities among underserved communities have really exacerbated coban 19 and i think as dr perry said it's really the second pandemic on top of everything that has going on in 2020 this year with kovid and the racial unrest so that was the topic of our discussion um and myself personally you know actually started my career out with the bms foundation with john and patty and specifically in south africa so global health and health equity i'm an immigrant from nigeria myself so global health and health equity has always been a passion of mine and really having a firsthand experience with my father and my grandmother in nigeria who didn't have access to the medication that she needed at the time so really passionate about the theme of our discussion today and taking action to address health equity so thank you thank you so much coming and then dr fields there's so many screens are you with us dr fields yes i am can you hear me of course perfectly hi i'm anthony fields and um it may be obvious from my name that i'm my father's namesake and um not only am i his namesake but on his legacy and his dream and every day i am grateful for what he's instilled in me the grit thank you dave for that amazing name humility compassion um and um also i'm passionate about collaboration so i work in global strategic collaborations at bristol myers squibb and um being in strategic collaboration i firmly understand that it's the wellspring that is that will bring about innovation that will address all of the world's uh complex problems um also i'm enveloped in the sphere of stem since third grade and i'm having my phd microbiology and immunology my goal at this point similar to our guests have been to inspire mentor and the next generation so that they can rescript the narrative and reclaim their possibilities and the hopes um in hopes that they can find a cure for diseases such as pancreatic cancer that you know prematurely shorten my dad's life um so i'm thrilled to be here with this group which you play an incredible important role in how we pull together and innovate to bring great solutions that will change the complex problems such as health equities um so thank you so much dave for this opportunity oh my gosh yeah um so um because of how powerful this is and also how short our time is together i don't think we can rip each other apart i think this is a really important moment to be together also our technical vendor dropped the ball and they won't let us do breakouts right now so we're gonna stay together so is everybody okay if we stay together okay okay so so let's stay together and i believe there are no coincidences so um at the end of this conversation i love it thank you at the end of this conversation we were going to ask everyone if you would like to be involved in each of these areas going forward and our intention is to create working groups to make real change in each of these areas so with our three groups lgbtq plus accessibility issues and optimal outcomes and racial and ethnic disparities if any of you want to in the chat function right now write a one a two or a three if you want to spend more time having conversations and really creating outcomes together so write a number one for lgbtq plus if you want to be involved in changing the future for the better number two if you're interested in accessibility and optimal outcomes for all people and then a number three if your passion is racial and ethnic disparities and changing those all right so our team is going to grab all these oh my gosh oh my gosh all right so what's that coming thank you so we're going to send a survey out this is how we were going to capture this initially because our plan for 2021 is to move beyond conversation to action and start to create the change that we want to see in each of these areas so everybody that's put this number will reach out to you and share more about that and then the survey that goes out please share that with anybody else that wants to be a part of it and so we will move from this conversation today into creating working groups with outcomes and providing resources and expertise in 2021 to work on that together so thank you for everybody who jumped in on that and also for being flexible on the change of the approach um i can feel that there are people that need to contribute to this conversation so who would like to jump in and just just go with where we are right now anybody please hey dave this is perry i don't want to jump in but i just need to tell you all that i have to i have to go because the paparazzi is calling and you know when the paparazzi calls you know i i tend to respond uh no seriously i i'm sure it's another interview about not having thanksgiving which i'm totally fine with but i loved being part of this and i'm honored to have been part of this conversation and i leave you in really amazing hands with kristin and we're not letting you get away perry so we'll be back thank you thanks perry please anyone go ahead um contextual factors that influence patients outcomes and particularly for the lgbt community and we know that the social conditions in which people are born people grow up work experience life these are all um significant and influence their health outcome however what we have seen is that there's a clear differential when it comes to access to care along the race and ethnic lines and um even when we look at downstream analysis of patient outcomes it reveals that disparities accumulate across that entire health uh healthcare continuum and this is only compounded when we're looking at using like an intersectionality framework and looking at additional dimensions such as economic status and even when analyzing health outcomes along the diversity dimensions like let's say sexual orientation worse outcomes are observed along race and ethnicity line so now when we are considering how organizations across disciplines and sectors attempt to formulate solutions those traditional models of addressing these disparities by engaging just underrepresented minority communities those fall short um they fall short because those uh health equity those health outcomes are not changed in a meaningful way and by working separately and then this is what's wonderful about this opportunity to bring together this very diverse group of people by working separately and focusing downstream of the patient journey a lot of resources expended to catch and reduce health disparity and we don't get the outcome what we know is that um that if we can focus the interventions upstream on um structural and social determinants of of health those will have more and also by advancing those interventions collaboratively either in multi-sector multi-disciplinary manner um that will and and also what we're doing is bringing together our complementary uh tools and resources then that's going to deliver the greatest benefit if any of our other panelists want to share what you're going to jump right in or anybody it's an open floor i think um this is patty i'm definitely interested in hearing from the participants how you feel the opportunities to advance health equity to address some of these disparities take the holistic approach how is it starting to show up in your work or has it already been there what do you see as some of the most important things to do going uh going forward you know it's been really i think affirming to see that because of the the understanding that's really been created about health inequities how severe they are how they really do exist and they end up with loss of life and much greater suffering by certain populations as we've seen with kovid um you know that that new awareness that new consciousness i think in folks who have maybe been on the bench uh on these issues or who have not understood them before they get it now they know that it's important so just be interested to hear from from the the folks who have joined us just in the patient advocacy space and the patient supportive service space um what are some disparities you'd like to work on and um and ones that you've seen that that you'd like to set aside and any any work that you're probably many of you probably are doing great things so any work you're already doing in this space would be wonderful to hear thanks steve patricia i'll just make a oh sorry go ahead no tina marie please oh sure hi hi patty um for everybody on the call my name is tina marie duff i am the dawn which is disability uh differently abled workplace network uh erg lead at bristol mars square i'm a caucasian female middle age and i'm looking very disheveled today with my hair pulled back in a ponytail to do a visual descriptor thank you to the asl interpreter as well so patty one of the things that um representing the disability community and i had the opportunity to speak uh with at the grit forum so thank you dave and team that i am seeing is um kind of like the next step for the disability community beyond ada which is this call for economic and employment equity and i think that looking at the connection and the intersectionality with the disability community as well as communities of color there's a lot um lgbt community there's just a lot of intersectionality and once we see a closing of some of the gaps of employment and we know that only 30 percent of people with disabilities are actually have employment and that's common around the the g10 countries um we'll start to close some of that gap on the health inequity health inequities that we're also seeing so i applaud the financial community that is having a call to action for more disability employment and the corporations that are putting in initiatives like bristol mars web of having an intense focus on the disability inclusion and hiring practices and also more and more uh organizations like disability and aapd that are also raising the bar and kind of creating a benchmark for organizations to look at where they're at today and move forward because i think this is one way we can start to address that gap that's great thanks to you i i just wanted to to bring up what i think is a really important point something that perry said that you know this there are as he put it there uh there are black people there are gay people there are gay black people this is a a whole issue for everyone and um separating these groups and recognizing that you know that was just part of the breakout and then we would come together at the end and look at crossover between the groups as well as kind of key points that we need to address for specific groups i think that's a key point um one of the things that i that i wanted to recognize is that within our hospital system it's become much much more driven by profit and because of that it's very hard to to get access for all people um one of the things that i recognize a lot of especially in the community i live in inner city hospitals have closed down because they're not as as profitable hospitals have moved out to the community um i'm sorry into the suburbs and that's a huge issue i imagine stuff like that is happening across the country where hospitals that serve minorities and serve the underrepresented aren't able to to stay in business without support from these larger academic institutions things like that kind of these basic points where we need to increase access we need to improve quality of healthcare for everyone but access is a huge point that we need to strengthen our national efforts our coordination but also our state efforts and our local efforts and within our individual communities there's really these cross points and there's also specifics that we need to learn so you know what are the things that we need to understand about the lgbtq community that really speak to their needs and their individual needs as well or about the black community for instance understanding clinical trials and the the lack of confidence that a lot of black people have in our health care system because of a a long huge history of systemic racism and and problems and and and uh and clinical trials run without their knowledge so there's all these key points and we want to bring those all together as dave said and have key working groups in the specific areas but also have a working group that addresses all these cross this this crosstalk these areas where we overlap so i just wanted to say that and thank you everyone for being here and appreciate you guys um doing with the technical issues so i did want to this is anthony so i didn't want to um talk about clinical trials because um i'm not sure who is in the audience but um i don't think it's an overstatement to say that the lack of diversity in clinical trials is as much of a moral issue as it is a scientific one and um just to level set for those who may not understand how you know these quote-unquote human experiments fit into the treatment landscape like they don't they don't just benefit the company or the institution executing them but they serve as a critical part of the patient journey that expands options when the standard of care and the normal sequence of medication interventions have been exhausted so it it literally gives people a more time and that's additional time to get another hug to impart a lasting wisdom to make more memories um and and that should be accessible to all and and dealing with some of the trust issues is something that we're continuing to work on as well however at bristol myers quib we've been able to do we've executed a forum where we had best practices thought leaders come in to share best practices and if there is if you're directly approaching the patients and and the message is coming from a trusted voice they will participate the black community will participate in clinical trials so that is definitely a focus of ours as well um i'm not sure if this is the correct place to be i'm asking this or if there are any other um students i'm not um a pharmacist just yet i'm a p3 at southern illinois university school pharmacy uh my name is chen allison i'm also the mental health chair for snafa the student national pharmaceutical association um so um so um we do our organization does focus on the underserved and those a lot of populations who are i'm living like below the poverty line and don't have um you know access to um all the resources that are available to a lot of population um and so you know recently we do a lot of um like flu clinics that go to areas that just don't have the availability of the access to those kinds of things um and like i was saying um i don't know if there are any other educators out there or preceptors or anybody who has that kind of experience but i've noticed that um our membership's kind of um dwindling a little bit i know it's it's you know a lot of it is covered um but also at the same time i wonder if you guys have any like ways of letting your message get out to you know other students out there or potential you know people in this field um to really get them impassioned into you know what we're trying to do for the community um because you know me being a member and me going out there and actually making a difference in these communities i can see what i do and we can take the pictures we can do um you know like our testimonials and things like that um but i was just wondering like what other things do you guys you know do to really get other people involved in this movement um and yeah i mean i don't know it's just it's just something that you know i was thinking about you know while we're talking about this and just trying to like get more momentum within the students i don't know if this is the right place for that but it does affect like our future you know practitioners and our future um you know patients that we're able to to help you know that's great i mean just uh something that i will offer first it's so exciting to hear about the amazing work that you're doing as a student i know this is going to carry throughout your whole career but i think a lot of organizations right now are just getting clear on this so maybe working with um snap i think is the name of the group here just to state that this is a priority for you and then maybe think about what are you all good at what are the things that you regularly do really really well and then with your group kind of put a health equity lens on it say you know who do we reach now where where's the next group that we have to reach or what are the issues we work on now what are some other ones that we need to get involved in maybe we need to get more involved in not just medical solutions but social justice solutions and become like an anti-racist organization as an example so i think that's i mean always starting at home like you have great strength you have a great group of people and just think about for my platform how can it be mobilized against these issues and sort of revisit that and see the things you can do and then and then the other thing is that porsche is a lot of movement and this is a great group to be involved in there's a lot of folks on the phone and are part of this community who are also taking actions so you can also survey to say is there somebody who we can also you know hitch our wagon to or put our efforts alongside so that you know as much leverage as much good use of resources that we can get is really really great so i think i would just start that why that way it's just know that you have strengths that can be used against this and just you know do a little bit of thinking about all right what are the three things we're going to try and do in this next year but most importantly we're going to let the world know we are very concerned about this this is a priority for us we'll be applying you know our activities and goals against this and then creating some areas for action i think might be a way to start yeah i think patty brought up a really really good point as far as collaboration in this space and i think anthony was talking about it earlier as well that it's really there's so many different stakeholders when it comes to health equity and we can't all work in silos or we're not going to achieve our goals here so really being vocal and intentional about your goals and your commitment to health equity and underserved populations um even if you're not addressing everything but identifying what you do want to focus on and then finding partners and collaborative collaborators or allies in that space and i think the groups on this call are a great example um so i don't know if folks are shy today or they don't want to speak up i wanted to hear a little bit more examples of what is everybody doing or have you been able to achieve or maybe you tried something and there were challenges i think there's great things that we can learn um from the challenges and lessons learned and how to improve improve going forward as well so feel free to chime in i'll i'll speak um i'm on the great team doing social media but i have a son who's 13. and he listens to jacksepticeye who's a youtuber who happened to have been very who was very active he closed down his um he closed down his gaming for a day for black lives matter and he had a message that said there's too much important in the world for us to be thinking about games and then all of this money he donated then my son started to become more interested and i'm thinking um i'm thinking that this is us the television program and the young and the restless both have been doing health issues in their programming so you know while we're cross-pollinating i think i think we need to find out who are uh accessible gamers and youtubers and and writers um because i think people are not listening to people in authority anymore and people are also not listening to advocates as much because of their um lets us all separate um what am i trying to say i think there's a way in which people can hear information through stories that is not yet fully tapped out and i'm hopeful that we can find additional ways in addition to everything here to help support the gestalt um having more information in subtle ways then i'll be quiet thank you that's a really good point you know really impactful stories that are culturally competent and going to the right audiences wherever that may be um i think tv shows like you said and then youtubers social media influencers like there's so many avenues definitely yeah it's one of those things at the bristol myers club foundation we spend a lot of time on on monitoring and evaluation and metrics and data because you know at the end of the day we're trying to advocate for change in policy and treatment outcomes and you can't move the needle on that without you know without the data however in every one of those data outcomes we're always asking our partners about the stories of how it impacts an individual because that's what gets people mobilized you know payers make it mobilized by data people will get mobilized by stories of human interest and how what you're doing is impacting an individual absolutely and also the non-traditional partnerships that foster it's the non-traditional partners that are fostering innovation and have the ability and the potential to disrupt current models and bring about new outcomes so um you know i think everyone going back to the cell phone and how you had all of these new different um sectors that could combine together and then most recently you know i was just looking at social media and there was a collaboration between beyonce and peloton and how they're going to use the digital access they're going to provide digital access to hbcu students and then so that's going to impact the health of a new generation in supporting their continued um you know health healthy lifestyle so again it's to try to find that connection and if you can pull a few people together you'll you'll be able to identify what that commonality is and that non-traditional partnership is going to really make some you know good disruptive change so i think that that's wonderful hi my name is monique i am a global lupus advocate and also an ambassador and i do i really do focus a lot on how do we improve the health disparities and the gap in the access of care for those with autoimmune diseases and it's really been an interesting time for a lot of us during the past few months and the access to uh certain medications as we know plaquino hydrochloroquine and we've seen how that's impacted underserved communities as well and one of the things i'm just wondering if any of the panelists from the breakout groups if you might be able to share i've been really trying to um delve in to figure out how i as an advocate as an ambassador can be more sensitive to increasing health literacy and we understand that that's a an additional social determinant that impacts how we understand health information how we digest it how we share it and it's different for all groups just as perry was talking about communities and populations that's different and i'm just wondering if any of you have any takeaways that might help us to increase that health literacy within those groups so we know how to better inform them so um as a result of the the covert it was evident that you know misinformation and discrimination was rampant negatively impacting communities of color black and latinx communities and so we leveraged um a partnership with a a particular community group and what they're doing is developing a communication campaign for us to address some of the [Music] misinformation disinformation and so what we're pulling together is a community partner with um trusted voices in the form of thought leaders experts who again um look like the community that we're talking to and also have the expertise behind them to and then using that social media platform to disseminate the information prior to that you know we partnered with a company that an organization that delivered um a 22nd a 20 it was a 20 second or more which was a simple guide on hand washing and the importance of hand washing 20 seconds of hand washing and so dougie fresh and then just tapping into that one resource dougie fresh they were able to pull the community organization that pulled this together they were able to pull and tap so many different artists and the way that that information disseminated was primarily through the individual artists disseminating that information on their instagram so sometimes it's identifying that one person and um one of our speakers someone said just mentioned that the traditional ways of communicating particularly to the younger generate generation is changing so social media getting in touch with um one person and having them disseminate the information um for you and cascading that that's what we found very um like very uh effective hope that helps hi this is devin i work as a communication access professional and i help disrupt barriers at the hospitals and doctor's offices and i do that by providing sign language making sure they provide sign language interpreters one other thing you can do to prove improve communication is to always have information there on your website like videos with interpretation provided automatically and captioning and the sign language interpreters already there in the deaf person's natural language as a way to access the information easier there's also ways that you can add qr codes and you can have a different catalog of different signs listed on your website as well you can have different you know access services listed for pharmacies pharmacists and pharmacies you know you can have other things that are common questions you can have those recorded as a video so that you could show that to people for um you know making sure that there's more access for deaf folks um and so again this is devin speaking not mabel that was devin hi this is elizabeth iglesias with lupus and ally diseases association um i just wanted to contribute to the conversation and let everyone know this is just so very important um john uh i really was focused on your talk because at lupus and alley diseases we just did um health equity and diversity inclusion and we developed a work group and we've revamped to take a look at ourselves and make sure that our organization looks like the the people that we're working with and um we've we've revamped our our statements and and we're taking a look at ourselves and really making sure that we are like our disease you know really servicing the um the the communities that are disproportionately affected by lupus and and looking like the people we are serving being transparent and so that was very very wonderful karen thank you kristen i mean thank you so very much for your presentation along with patrick because uh uh that was just amazing um when with regards to the socio-economic disparities that um people are are facing with regards to not being able to access um wi-fi or being able to have language barriers um when we when we have these new um new technologies and being able to access telemedicine this is this is becoming an access issue for people and in when when dan said about access this is my thing what can we do to provide access to these people that are having these social economic problems because i'm finding that this is this is a real deal problem for latin latin people for black communities that you have barriers that are existing that are so socio-economic problems that are causing access issues to care because we are improving technology but our people are just not up up to the coming up to where they should be is there one more person would like to jump in before we wrap i'll just elizabeth brought up a really good point this is tina marie speaking um and access is a huge issue in in many forms um whether it's digital access or physical access and one of the things i'm seeing and even in our own company is a a greater reach into the communities that are most impacted by by access whether it's um you know building more clinical trials in smaller uh cities or cities that may be impacted economically i see that kind of shift the other thing i just want to point out is a call to action and perry perry alluded to it and many others have too it's the concept of not for us without that without us and that's the cry of many communities including the disability community that used to be related to policy but as we're trying to sit around a table and solve for this without having people that represent what you're trying to solve for and there's many times i've been pulled into conversations to try to help an employee who is deaf and they see through face masks are not working for this employee or review a website that is geared to a certain disease state right my first question is who have you brought in that is being impacted with this to help remove the barrier to to address the the solution because many many times people know what they need the other thing and i can't remember who was saying that before it might have been devin uh and thank you devon for all your good points is we are always looking and auditing from a disability perspective how the community is engaging with us and one of the things that we have quickly remediated is our external facing websites right are they ycag which is website content accessible guidelines so that individuals who are using screen readers and are part of the disability community can they find jobs right the first thing is can they find a job at bms can they access information about our drugs um and so forth so not only is there all these other very tactical things but sometimes you have to go all the way back into the very beginning and find out how are you engaging with the community you want to engage and and start to remove those barriers and think about it as we're removing barriers no we're not trying to fix a problem often we take a medical community approach to a disability of oh we want to fix it where it's really we just need to remove the barrier so i just want to thank the team and lots of great points here i'm loving being part of these conversations thank you thank you tina marie um i don't know what i could summarize to convey how powerful this is um the only thing that comes to mind is that in one of our prep conversations this week um kemi and anthony's i think i started yesterday crying um because i asked one of our speakers how they wanted the audience to feel after our conversations and the person said that if you're a person of color that you feel acknowledged and heard and cared for and that if you're in any minority group you feel part of the conversation and if you're not if you're someone who isn't part of those groups that you feel like you have brothers and sisters who want to create the change that we all want together and i'm so glad we didn't break out into different groups today i think it needed to happen this way so just two things i'll leave us with to please continue this really important conversation um the first is tomorrow and saturday is our global virtual cancer conference uh it's an event that we created with bristol meyer squibb as our founding partner our opening presentation tomorrow is by an artist named benjamin shoyer and he is a cancer survivor and will sing about finding your voice and one of his new songs is called i am samantha and it is the story of a trans woman and what her experience is like um he is such a powerful artist i encourage you to join tomorrow and saturday um we have several sessions on health equity and would love everybody here to be a part of that you can find it just google global virtual cancer conference and the last thing to leave everybody with is um lodi are you on is the survey going to go out on the 17th it is dave it'll go out next week on tuesday thank you thank you so much yeah so um in the survey we want to know what issues are most important to you because that's how we're going to create the groups next year to really focus on change so everybody that put your number in the side will keep those and follow up with that and really start to create some working groups to make change in these areas um i'm speechless and don't know what else to say other than thank you we'll see everybody again very soon [Music] you
