 -My big, new diamond ring keeps throwing off my balance. -Oh, good for you, Bev. Oh! Whoo! That must have cost your wife a pretty penny. -You wouldn't believe the disgusting sexual perversion I had to perform to get that -Oh, I think I would. Meet the twins. Ha! -Yes, ma'am! Oh! Karen Walker. I thought I smelled gin and regret. -Beverley Leslie. You look more like a woman every time I see you. -Karen Walker, so nice to see you. -Why, Beverley Leslie, if you'd sit on a phone book it would be nice to see you, too. [ Both smooching ] -I must have died during surgery 'cause the devil herself is performing. -Why, Beverley Leslie, I thought they'd torn down all the corroded old Confederate statues. I wish I had a handsome man visiting me at work. -Well, well, well. Well, well, well. Well, well, well! Well, well, well. -Instead, I have the world's oldest girl. [ Laughing ] Aah! Get off of me, Tattoo! Get off of me! Ah! [ Laughing ] Ah! You bitch! [ Both grunt ] -It just breaks my heart that you don't have a partner for the spotlight dance. Such a pity a bottle of rum can't waltz. -Actually, I do have a date. Yes, I was just on my way to meet him by the punch bowl. Or as you would call it, the swimming hole. -This gown is going to the Smithsonian tomorrow. It's going to be put into their permanent collection -Oh, how exciting for you. A dress in the Smithsonian and your parents in the museum of miniatures. -Karen Walker in the flesh Whose flesh is unclear. Why, Beverley Leslie, what are you doing later tonight, honey I'm having a few friends over for a game of Monopoly, and I'm missing one of the pieces. -You. -Oh! Oh, good Lord, you scared me Shouldn't you be in your tree making cookies? -I am so sorry I missed the ceremony, but tell me this, darlin' -- do they still say, "Till death do us part," when the bride is a vampire? -[ Laughs ] That pasty, pretentious eunuch Beverley Leslie is coming over to play pool. -So cancel. -Honey, no, he's my dearest friend!
