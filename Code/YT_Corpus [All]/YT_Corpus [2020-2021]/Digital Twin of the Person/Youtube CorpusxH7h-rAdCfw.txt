 everyone Daniel here from twin bites with another quick video for you this time with the covered 19 going out and everyone's panicking businesses are getting shut down and some people are being forced to get laid off or if you can work from home then you can actually keep your businesses going so I'm going to be talking about that in this video a little bit so in case even your boss doesn't even realize and they're thinking that they're gonna lay you off you could probably sell them on the idea of how you could still keep providing value to their business and keeping the business alive while they can work from home so I'm going to be covering the basics in this video and a few other things you might not have even considered so stick around [Music] so the first thing is email so a lot of people they're using their computer you have an email program of some sort maybe you're using webmail already and in that case you already know that you have webmail but some people don't even realize that it's web-based and that you can access that from anywhere in the world on any computer even having it on your phone you would think that's a clue that you could have it with you anywhere but I've actually got a client that they still think that opening up a web browser is a program and that's the program on their computer it's tied to that computer they don't realize it's web Basin that you can access it from other computers so I wondered how many other people don't know that it's web-based so even if you're using a program like Outlook which is very popular for business you can still access your emails remotely every email address has web mail capability you just may not be using it if you have like for example your website like we've got twin bites dot C a so as an example of that one you would just add possibly to the beginning of your domain name which in my case a domain name is twin bites dossier it would be mail dot and then your domain name so mail dot twin bite CA or mail google.com it could be web mail dot and then whatever it is or it could be twin bite CA slash web mail or twin bite CA / mail whatever your website address is and then add a slash to it and then mail or web mail so you may have to find out from your hosting company what the addresses and how to access that if you're not sure who your hosting company is you can go to who is comm slash who is type in your domain name so again Google com but you're not Google so it would be your company name com like twin by CA and then it will tell you who is your host so then you can actually go to your hosting company and they may have a link straight from there to access webmail and then from there you would go into your webmail account and you could put in your email address and your password for your email and you now have access to your emails online the second thing here is web-based tools a lot of the tools you might have would be accounting programs contact management collaboration tools online meetings which is already online but you would have an in-person meeting that you can now have online and there's tons of software out there for different online meetings now a lot of the software's already been developed to be online and web-based for years now so it's nothing new if you're already set up to be in the cloud then you don't need to think about remote access to the computer or working at the office you could be just signed in through your web browser all you need is your username and password and sign into your accounting online or any of those other tools and have full access exactly the same as you would have while sitting in the office even online mediums are incredible I've had so many different business meetings that I would have been going to since this outbreak happened with the koban 19 but they are all online now even my Toastmasters club which of course we couldn't meet in person but for the first time our Club hosted an online Toastmasters meeting the third thing is remote access so that's what we were leading to here if you don't have easy access on the web through these other things that I mentioned already you could just simply remote into your computer and have full access to it just as if you were sitting in front of computer then whether the programs and documents are in the cloud or local on the computer you would have access to everything so there's a few options out there there's actually quite a few but some of the more popular ones I'm going to mention here so we got things like logged me in they are basically offering at four hundred and fifty dollars a year for two computers and that works out to about $19 per computer for a month comparing that to $35 a month per computer for GoToMyPC which seems to be also owned by the same company there are two the more inexpensive options a third one here is TeamViewer which for business use is $58 a month and that's for one user one session and it seemed like it was more initially for tech support because at those prices it's a basically double what these other two services are so because it's more for tech support but they do offer a free version with TeamViewer and they're the only ones that offer free the other ones are only paid bought TeamViewer and I confirm with them that is for personal use only which means home to home so if you're a home user that wants to help a family member with their computer you can connect into their computer remotely and help them out and that's free but if it's for business use they can't they have algorithms in place that will determine if you're using it for business and then it will shut you down and kick you out so if you just needed temporary access to your office remotely you can certainly try that they do offer a free trial as well and if it works for you great but it's probably going to recognize if you're in there all day every day consistently working remotely using the free version of TeamViewer they're probably going to kick you out playing your account so you would have to purchase the license but honestly looking at that if it's a one-to-one you'd have to look at how many computers you have and if you're doing them as a group between all employees it may change who's cheaper in this case and what's more reliable while between these they all seem to be the top three tools in my opinion that are well-known reliable trustworthy and really it looks like overall if you have only one computer you want to connect to go to my PC would be the cheapest but if you have a minimum of two computers to connect to remotely then LogMeIn would work out to be cheaper while still having a license to make sure that you're doing everything legit working remotely in summary here is really even without having a global pandemic like what we're having now with the Komen 19 it helps the environment because you're cutting down on traffic you're cutting down on fuel emissions in the air you're keeping your employees happy and cutting down on costs there's probably a whole host of other benefits here that I'm not even thinking of also on a slightly related note it's always a good idea to practice safe practices anyway regardless if there's a human virus outbreak or not washing your hands using hand sign it sanitizer and all that stuff just so many people that don't even wash our hands after they leave the washroom and I can't believe that but if we were to practice safe practices on a regular basis when there isn't an outbreak then we could have reduced at least if not prevented this massive spread of the code 19 currently had we been practicing these safe measures to begin with why did so many people wait until there's an outbreak and then they make a mad rush to the store to clear the shells wine all the hand sanitizer and toilet paper and all this stuff and vitamin C even is it's gone I went to buy some because I just I needed to get some more and I just wanted to buy one bottle shelves are empty so why wait until there's an issue and then you want to start taking preventive measures measures it's not really preventive so much anymore it's already too late stuff is out there so you got to continue to do this so I'm curious if after this whole pandemic is over and everything kind of goes back to normal are people going to revert back to not washing their hands again after they go to the washroom and things like that or are they gonna continue to practice more safe practices hope you're still watching this video to the end thanks so much don't forget to subscribe if you haven't already and give it a thumbs up if you found it helpful or entertaining even at that and be curious to find out what's the shelves in your local stores look like are they empty do you still have vitamin C and hand sanitizer there the time you're watching this video maybe this whole outbreak is over but I'm curious about the stock levels how is this gonna continue anyway appreciate your comments below and until next time stay safe my friends bye for now
