 welcome to introduction to privacy engineering did you know that 87% of the US population can be uniquely identified by the combination of their date of birth zip code and gender hi I'm Daniel ranky and I'm very thrilled to be teaching this course I got my PhD from UC Berkeley for work in artificial intelligence during my studies I identified a lot of algorithms that could give a lot of strength try to infer and identify individuals and then I got me thinking maybe we can use AI for the other side of the coin maybe we could use AI to protect the identity and information about individuals in this course we will be discussing these topics we will discuss the different risks that arise in privacy situations from confidentiality to anonymity to inference we will build models that achieve protection against these risks and we will implement algorithms that implement those models by the end of this course you will be able to describe these models you'll be able to critique their strengths and weaknesses you will be able to implement them in your software systems and you will be able to keep up with the state-of-the-art in the field of privacy I'm very thrilled to start this course so let's start you
