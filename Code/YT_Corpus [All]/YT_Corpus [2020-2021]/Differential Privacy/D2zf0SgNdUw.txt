 [Music] hi everybody I'm Andy Chang product manager and Google's cloud security team I'm joined here by dan I'm a Danny male and with Capital One and I perform in our cloud governance and compliance space for our multi cloud environments and dan and I will be splitting the presentation duties I'll do the beginning part Dan will talk about Capital One's experience living this in the cloud and then we'll wrap up sure when I start I'm gonna maybe ask you a question I had got last that question now what's in your wallet so I'll start with actually a cautionary tale so stay tuned for that and you're gonna see a slide that you're probably not used to at Google presentations of this type thank you for having cool so you're in SEC 209 shared responsibility what this means for you as a C so and I think hopefully you're benefiting for some of the comfiest chairs for any of the talks much better than the ones in the large stage area so you know as you've probably since you've been into a few of these sessions we're also taking questions in the Dory and so go to your app if you have questions that come up as we're talking please enter those in and we'll handle them towards the end we'll be covering a few things you know the overall one of the questions that I get talking to customers is what is the exact split on the shared responsibility model how do I understand it how do i leverage that how do I make sure that the cloud provider is doing what they supposed to do and that my own company's doing what we're supposed to do so I talked a little bit about perceptions of what customers care about in security the understanding that shared responsibility division focusing on visibility and control and then ultimately focusing on a quick architecture example then I'll turn it over to Dan to kind of talk you through the lived experience at Capital One how they've been successful on multiple public clouds and then we'll wrap up with questions and answers so when customers talk to me things I hear that folks care about are really that the right data is delivered to the right customer at the right point in time for the right purpose each and every time and that's some of the core of security the right thing and only the right thing happens when it's supposed to happen in addition given as we all see the current threat environment and the activity of threat actors increasing it's important not just to react wet situations but also to to be able to anticipate and innovate ahead of through these threats addition many of you are in regular to regulated environments so it's important partner to be able to essentially enable you to deliver on your responsibilities while running your businesses in the public cloud and lastly and really the focus of this is understanding and having a clear understanding of possibility model I think we're gonna switch over to it's here okay so now we're I think this is - sorry folks give us one second to get this straight now okay all right so this is better cool all right so we're gonna technical difficulties cool alright can you guys hear me okay we're gonna go with that hand mic and see if how this goes thank you so we're gonna you know the focus of this talk is really on the understanding enabling you guys to understand where that split is from a shared responsibility standpoint and really ultimately for you as CISOs as you as folks part of the security part of the organization enabling you to actually accelerate your company's business velocity with enabling your stakeholders to have and understand really what is the controllable and acceptable amount of risk so really focusing on this area at Google the way we think about the shared responsibility model is really around two key items security of the cloud and security in the cloud and we'll talk about how we divvy those things up in a moment from a core principle standpoint security at Google is done defense-in-depth we have at least two layers of protections that are independent from each other between anything of interest anything you want to protect and any kind of bad activity or threat actor at scale so as you can imagine Google I think other folks have said we're twenty five percent plus of the internet our traffic standpoint things done at Google for security or for other things have to be done fully at scale and work at scale and by default right how do we enable our developers how do we enable the system so that the controls that are necessary required are enabled by default and so that folks can run at the core underlying this is really the use of strong cryptographic credentials and identity and what that means is that whether it's a machine whether it's a human whether it's the data whether it's the code whether it's the underlying service they all have unique cryptographic identities that we can compare against what should be happening and provenance the ability to establish through a hardware root of trust that the underlying hardware the low-level software the OS software the applications that are running are all fully attested to at each stage and that we're writing running and write the right code at the right time the other part of this is that you know at Google we think Trust isn't gained just through technology but also through transparency and really what that means to you and to customers in general is thinking about reducing what we call the unverifiable trust surface what that means is minimizing the amount you actually have to trust us as a cloud provider having you being provided enough information so you can make a decision on of your own to verify the claims that we're making and that's a core part of what we're trying to do ultimately we're interested in providing customers the capabilities to help you build secure applications and fulfill your part of the shared responsibility model when we think about the controls that are in place we really think about them in three kind of areas underlying control things that really help you protect the data visibility the ability to classify the data and monitor the actions on that data and then detection response the ability actually validate the controls running and detect essentially things that are non-compliant activities that could be threats or from bad actors and for each of these areas we have technology that we provide to enable that when we think about the shared responsibility model it's important to understand that the boundaries of that share responsibility vary based on which types of services you're using and for many of our customers they're using a spectrum of services which is why it's not surprising that as you because a CSO or as a part of the security team the details of for what service in which part can add to additional complexity and so it's important to understand where those divisions are when you're running on premise where everything in the blue represents the customer so when you're running on premise you own all of your hardware stack your relationships the underlying software running so not surprisingly the full responsibility is really on you as the customer when you're running as an infrastructure of service which is essentially running your own virtual machines on our platform but installing your own images setting up your own network architectures the responsibility for us is to provide you the ability to log in audit the things that are running on the system the network the underlying hardware and infrastructure the pieces that you're building on top of so that the services we provide to you are secure and then you're responsible for putting those things together in secure architectures when are you writing a platform as a service like bigquery or App Engine one of those things now really you're providing us code that you're running and we're responsible for delivering the underlying services that execute that code in a safe and secure way and when you're using software that we've provided now we're responsible as well for the code so if you're using Gmail or drive or Docs that code is then become part of Arc's responsibility and then the thing that you focus on is access to those applications access to the data that you provide and then the data that you're loading into those applications that's kind of a quick summary of the different levels and we'll go into some of this in more detail so as we talked about from a Google perspective we think about security of the cloud and in the cloud of the cloud is the core about the core infrastructure that you're then using and the core services to build your products and applications for your consumers for Google we're responsible for security of the cloud and we think about it as again defense-in-depth at scale by default we model kind of the underlying architecture that you're running on top of in nine layers everything from the hardware all the way through the underlying low-level software the applications and ultimately to usage and everything that we do at Google is rooted in a hardware root of trust which is the titan chip that you've heard of through last couple kind of next conferences it's a purpose-built chip that we've built and it sits on our compute cards or processor cards and establishes on boot a cryptographic identity for that piece of hardware and verifies that all the underlying pieces of software that are meant to boot are doing so in the right way that the hardware components are correct and in configured the right way and if any of those things fail that card or that compute instance does not actually boot and be entered into the fleet and that allows us to make sure once something goes through that it's in a known good State and it can be put into the rest of the fleet and start serving customers and those that becomes the underlying piece that drives our servers our storage our network and then ultimately our data centers and what that allows us to do then is reduce the threat for folks injecting either malicious hardware malicious software into our systems in combination with that as we talked about at the beginning it's important for us at Google that we have the ability for the code that we write for the to define that the right identity access is the right machine is authorized by the right code accessing the right data and it's in the right time and context and that's done through a cryptographically secure identities so not only users have identities machines and services have identities devices have identities and then code and data have identities and checking all of those things when we run a Google service is a core part of our underlying platform here's a stack a little more detail of the different pieces within Google that come into play to secure each layer you'll see that there's at least two items at each layer that are put together to provide redundancy and really defense in depth whether it's the purpose-built underlying infrastructure or the fact that we from a boot standpoint cryptographically sign all the pieces of our boot software from an operating system and hypervisor standpoint we use our own version of KVM where we stripped out very lot of parts of the virtual machine monitor reduce its attack surface and risk surface we've also then added sandboxing in so that further creates a level of isolation from an OS standpoint we use our own curated operating system for our host side we also make that available as the container optimize OS for you as a customer to use if you're using our container optimized OS you can also enable automatic updates which will patch the container optimize OS so you can leverage and benefit from the same type of security controls we have when we run on our host side from a storage and network standpoint unique to cloud providers all services all data is encrypted at rest and in transit at Google the logging of kind of both internal Googler access as well as providing audit logs for your users and your systems what they do in your systems an identity access management system that allows us to do fine-grained permissions and then really managing those keys that are core part of encryption at scale from a networking side we have one of the world's largest private networks what that means is that from when your data or your service is touched by a customer from outside our network it basically travels wholly on Google owned private networking private fiber to the server in our systems and that gives you not only performance advantages but gives you a single threat to choke from a network security standpoint there are no additional actors in the end the underlying hops from an application standpoint both from the whole software lifecycle from static analysis to the patching and checking of the packages that are loaded in we have control over that we also cryptographically sign each piece of software as it goes through a development stage and then check before it's deployed that the manifest has all the right policies applied that's something external eyes to customers as a part of binary authorization so if you want to adopt that same model that you can run vulnerability checks various types of patching checks static code analysis and then as long as code passes that create a cryptographic signature and have that check before the code is deployed able to do that through our binary authorization product this once the applications are up and running they're protected by our own global front-end and the web capabilities and DDoS capabilities around that and then we provide as well our own security scanning for l7 web application vulnerabilities that we use inside of Google as a product called cloud security scanner for you to use as a customer when things are deployed at scale we were very fond of saying that your first users are typically abusers so whenever we deploy a service we see a lot of attack traffic therefore the built-in DDoS for our own services the ability to be our own CA so it's very hard for folks to forge anything related to kind of connecting to Google and that all services provider Google are at full TLS finally from an operation standpoint not just trusting us but having third parties do compliance checking the ability to do live migration which enables us to do patching of live running VMs without taking your services down allows us to on a continuous basis do that level of patching and keeping things up is of highest level security and then we have full sock threat analysis and the ability from a user standpoint to connect to our services through beyond Corp as your trust type network as well as the will for them to do a hardware base second factor for a security key and that is the structure for every service created at Google and used it's Google and the tools in which you would then build on top of when you use one of our services we think about enabling customers we do this providing the same type of set of services either in the dark green as products you can consume in the light green as either products that you can use from Google or that you can get from partners or in the case of the dark blue core things we still do by default for you when you're running on Google cloud platform we're going to talk and highlight some of the key differentiators on Google cloud platform that it will help you do your job better and fulfill your part of the shared responsibility from a visibility and control side so one of the core things which we announced two general availability this morning is the cloud security command center that's that central pane of glass that you can bring in detections from Google native products third-party products or ones you've written yourself for vulnerabilities and threats all in one place and see those in context with your assets and the business context of those services and the sensitivity of the data gives you one place to look for visibility one thing for you to then query understand your data and then the ability to trigger prevention detection in action in addition what we feel is is part key partly to understanding the attack surface is understanding where your data is and what sensitivity level that is done what we provide is the same service we used within Google for the classification our cloud dlp API which is designed to work at data at exabyte and petabytes scales which allows you then to number-14 data sitting in Google Cloud storage or data sitting in BigTable bigquery tables to classify at scale sensitive data either through our built-in classifiers the ability use regular regular expressions or to express this in terms of data sets that we can train our models on once you've identified that data you would then have the choice of multiple D identification options simple things like substitution encryption more intricate things like format preserving encryption or transformations that allow the data still to be usable in analytics but still potent parallel pervert preserve privacy in addition unique to Google as we provide access transparency which means that we provide you in our audit logs notice every time a Googler accesses your data and for what region the reason what region that Googler was from and the case number in the case of customer initiates support events that triggered that access this is a this is across the wide range of Google services and unlike some of the other providers not just restricted to a small set of the provide services also at next we're very excited to announce access approvals which now allows you to prevent Googlers from access to the data in real time for a subset of the data so not only will we notify you if a Googlers trying to access data you can actually get the ability to say you will not allow that and grant that access and the Googler will no longer have access to that data and will note and will not start having access to that data the results of these are surfaced in cloud security command center also through the audit logging aap is one of the key parts we talked about earlier was trust through transparency and so part of that is there's a lot of things that we've told you about our technology and how we do things but you don't have to just trust us we go through twice a year set of certifications you'll see some of these here and that those certifications go on an ongoing basis working with your sales teams and with your account teams you can get access to some of the reports of these things so you can see for yourself that whether its overall global standards or country specific standards how we do against the requirements and certifications you need to run your businesses we move to control one of the key things that's unique to Google is an emphasis on providing out-of-the-box top-down logically central but globally distributed controls we were the first of the cloud providers to provide organization level viewpoint a top-down resource hierarchy that also is an iam boundary and also is a network boundary so you have the ability to start your systems and your developers in a safe mode where they have by design restricted access that you then can explicitly only grant through the IAM roles from an IAM standpoint we have over 300 curated roles so out-of-the-box the separation of duties are built in by those products requiring explicitly grants for folks to use that we have hierarchy and inheritance in our resource hierarchy so if you're given something at a folder level that person then can have the underlying roles in each of the products projects below that but if you're at a project level you can't go up the chain unless you're explicitly granted that type of access in addition we have org policies that you can define at the top level that can be enforced across all your organization regardless of the underlying pieces and then we're going to talk about two other things that affect your communication pattern VPC service controls which provide you the ability to find service perimeters so unlike the traditional l3 l4 networks which are based on routes and IPs and restrictions of based on IPs as you move to micro services services then have unique identities and you have the ability to block services access to particular types of sensitive data or projects and those can be applied to Google services as well so that you can block for example Google Storage writes or reads from particular set of resources only unless that those services have either belong to a particular access level or have a particular set of permission groups in addition we also provide a similar set of capabilities around your l3 l4 level networking so we have the ability for you create what's called a shared VPC and in that shared VPC define all the firewall rules that apply to all the tenant v pcs so you have again one logical choke point where you can provide the administration of your overall network and separate and independent from the underlying administrators of the other life projects both of these concepts are designed to provide you logical bottlenecks and choke points for control but not cost you anything on the performance side because they're implemented in globally distributed ways and those are unique to Google V PC service codes controls as I talked about is really defining service level perimeters which allow you to put that around specific sets of sensitive data allow you to define access levels and those access levels allow you to put policy requirements for example of what kind of geographies that the data can be accessed from what kind of restricted IPs what tichel device characteristics are needed to access that data those access context levels apply not only to infrastructure controls like this but also back into your G suite access to Doc's in Gmail so in one construct access levels you can define a set of controls that apply across both G suite and GC P similarly from a key management standpoint as I talked about by default your data is encrypted at rest and in transit but we know for some of our customers they have additional either regular retire requirements or views of their threat model or risk that require greater control of their keys so we provide a full spectrum from the left default encryption you don't have to do anything your data is encrypted at rest cloud key management system which allows you full control of creation of keys destruction of keys rotation times and periods full logging iam roles on those keys so you can demonstrate to your regularly and others that you have full control of keys cloud HSM which can is a hardware back solution so that you can have the route of trust for those kms keys be in hardware and it's a fifth level three Hardware Clovelly distributed cloud HSM system you can also if you need to have the key the root keys be sourced within your own org you can use cloud essentially this customer supplied encryption keys which allows you to push the encryption keys to us when you need something decrypted we do not store that key it stays only in memory for the live operation and therefore you have not only the root of trust in your own hardware system and we have no access to those online keys you can also have essentially the ability to stack HSM your own HSMs in our coalos if you want that further level additional control on essentially customer supplied encryption keys so depending on the risk parameters of your business you have a full spectrum of capabilities available to support data encryption and before I turn it over to Dan I'm gonna talk through now how the various controls get put together when you think about a secure architecture so first most customers start with a clean slate they have an existing on-premise or other cloud installation they have identity setup typically not a Google identity out of the box from an enterprise standpoint local compute gateways and then data so the first thing to do is to essentially connect to cloud I daddy which lets us federating identity service and now brings those identities to be used in cloud in Google cloud platform then through the groups and the underlying individuals a sign out the I am roles in policies did you want so that folks have the correct separation of duties the ability established upfront org level policies that apply regardless of the underlying pieces across your whole organization for example that VMs cannot have publicly facing internet addresses then the ability to fine again from l3 l4 level and overall control of your firewall rules and networking through shared V pcs breaking out from an H a standpoint and a disaster recovery standpoint the various regional pieces do you want to allocate within each of the regions the zones the resource allocation and then the underlying subnet connections by default and unique to Google our networks are global by default so you're able to make those connections very straightforward you don't have to pair between the different regions our V pcs are global by nature and you're able to therefore set up you know H a and D are very and very straightforward way next thing you want to do ultimately is you have data sitting your on-prem and you want to bring it securely into GCP or take the data that we compute and bring it back to your on-prem so common to combining cloud router firewall rules dedicated secure interconnect either through our own peering or through partner peering allows you to bring the data in and out of your area securely also we have VPNs to allow you to do that as well next piece then is from an application standpoint protect your application once you serve it from the typical attacks like DDoS so you can either use our default global load balancer which as long as you put that in front of one of your GCE services will take advantage of our global front-end you can use one of our managed services which has DDoS built-in or you can use the cloud armor product which gives you additional availability and the ability to write your own rules to fine-grained manage your DDoS and woth next piece then is you want to turn on logging so that you have the monitoring and evidence of things that might happen allow us to do detections and audit logs are turned on by default you can also look at VPC flow logs firewall logs and then general logging then you want to turn on the monitoring learning and detection pieces which include the cloud security command center security health analytics the ability to look at stackdriver monitoring running security scanner on your essentially at web applications and then if you want to dump the data into bigquery for additional processing you then create a service project which allows you to kind of create that boundary of control for the services you want to run and then create kind of a secure perimeter using VP service controls around that so that you can restrict which services can access that underlined data and then ultimately bring those data back through into GCP through either private access cloud dns and cloud matting so you can either replace your kind of subnets into GCP or push our subnet pieces out so in summary those are kind of the steps that you take to pull things in and are the building blocks of you building a secure service on GCP and some of the pieces we give you to fulfill your part of the shared responsibility model so with that I'm going to turn it over to Dan to talk to you about Capital One's journey great thank you okay Andy thank you for opening the stage and allowing me to present and open the windows on what's actually going inside going on inside of Capital One so I promised you a cautionary tale and this little creatures name is Altria Altria is a rescue dog that my 12 year old daughter picked up from the Richmond Animal League in Richmond Virginia what does this dog have anything to do with the topic of shared responsibilities compliance and controls on the cover probably absolutely nothing but take a closer look take a look at what's around her neck so here's the tale it happened shortly after Google 18 about a week after Google 18 this little dog Altria love her to death she has no malicious intent whatsoever but she's a runner she was trained as a hunting dog she's an American hound so on one particular night this was probably after v escaped from the homestead we live on a parcel out in the country we kept talking about let's put in a security fence an invisible fence and we kept holding off because the price was too high so I'm one particular event she left around 8 p.m. she has free run in the neighborhood we live in this river canyon on the James River we're about a mile on either side there are no fences and you can run from the Chesapeake Bay all the way to the mountains on this particular day it was about 11 p.m. at night we were exhausted we couldn't find her we came home and as I was planning to go around the house to check things out I felt this immense pain in my leg and I jumped and wondered what the heck happened so I looked down and on the corner of the eye there was a copperhead snake unfortunately that take that snake took advantage of the opportunity and as you know later that day I was in the the paramedics box I was at the hospital I was being treated for a copperhead snake bite so as you know in everyday life there are risk scenarios everywhere this is a very good example had we actually put in the security fence we would avoided Altria from escaping from our private domain out into the public so as a result we implemented this control it's a shot-caller so as you approach the fence she gets a really enlightening experience if she's able to go beyond that barrier into the public domain there are some other controls that we've implemented so what you might not know about the risk rescue dogs is that when you receive them you receive them with a chip so if they are if they are captured in public there's a way to identify those we also added a a collar or a tag the tag used to have only our home phone number but she runs so much that we actually had to put a cell phone number because we would get phone calls at home when we're actually out in the field looking for her so as you see now it has a lot to do with with cloud controls I'm sorry with controls with shared responsibilities it's the whole community so let me take you into the capital one journey I'm gonna open the window for you for a moment you won't see this often and I'm going to tell you and share with you a few nuggets on how we made our journey into the cloud successful so Capital One today has a significant need for cloud because it enables us to operate with the speed and agility required to succeed in the digital age our agile sprint teams work in two weeks cycles and according to then infrastructure must not be an impediment as a result of them moving to the cloud there are some stats and these are real numbers we've moved from a development environment build time of three months down to 30 minutes new product features which used to take a month now take two days with unparalleled visibility into our environments we have overall improved security posture I'm going to talk back on security in just a moment our current cloud status is this we have over 8,000 production applications and services 6,000 additional services and applications are in non production and nearly 100% of our production and development and test servers are in the cloud additionally moving to the cloud has increased our ability to secure and manage massive volumes of data of high quality data operating at a higher speed with greater resiliency faster recovery and at an extraordinarily lower costs with cloud our technology organization is free to do what we do best build digital breakthrough experiences for a customer if you are a customer of Capital One feel comfortable and knowing that we have your back and we are doing our very best using state-of-the-art technologies and best practices to protect your sensitive data to make this happen to make the security posture happen we've implemented a methodology around controls and compliance a lot of organizations might call this cloud governance or a governance function so essentially that's what it is it's an enterprise function at Capital One that balances the need of of compliance of cloud controls objectives and the needs of various stakeholders from our board of directors to executive management to the enterprise Kim like operations engineering and security and cyber all of the communities that come together to help enable our security capabilities in the cloud and most importantly then our divisional customers these are our lines of business our banking community were auto finance community our card community these are the application builders and consumers of cloud services another way to look at cloud control and compliance is it's the set of totality set of policies and procedures that help an enterprise move towards its goals while minimizing risk and conflicts so for us our journey here our goal is all in on the cloud and that's just about where we are so let's go back to then what is this cloud compliance function what I'm going to share with you is a best practice press practice example that is aligned very closely with the cloud security alliance methodology so think of this as a box of cake mix where you flip that box on the back side and it gives you all the ingredients these are all the ingredients to make it happen these are the best practices you have to include all of these in my opinion in your program for cloud compliance to have the maximum benefit to ensure that you're doing the appropriate level of due diligence for your environment I'll go by these one by one and then I'll give you some more detail on what they actually mean so first off you must document and maintain a catalog of control objectives these objectives are partially derived from NIST 800-53 or Fed met rep moderate they're also a compilation or a derivative of your internal security policies and procedures secondly for every single service that our cloud providers offer we perform a security control assessment using a selected set of security control objectives in that catalog and for now our current state is about for our catalog of about 300 controlled objectives we use about 50 of those that are directly applicable to cloud as it relates to our shared responsibilities and of those 50 15 of the control objectives are mandatory requirements meaning that if they if the service provider Google provides a service to us and it doesn't meet any of the 15 that's a showstopper so we'll just tell Google we're not ready yet we need some more features before it's safe for us to consume that service next once you've done the risk and the security assessments you move into the phase of performing the risk analysis on the gaps that you've identified relative to your control objectives so depending on which industry that you're in you may have a different set of objectives than what Capital One has as a financial service provider today we're using a composition of qualitative and quantitative methodologies we're looking very closely at probabilistic risk analysis which means that there's a probability in a risk scenario of an event happening over an annualized time period causing a loss of money in a particular range so now that you've identified your gaps now it becomes a tough part this is a continuous process on risk management control implementation control compliance control exception processing you have to implement your controls you have to monitor your controls for compliance and you have to allow application owners to make exceptions against using the services that might not have all the controls or for which you're not able to meet all of those not a requirement but the next one is the divisional governance advisor and what we've done is we've assigned a technical subject matter expert like myself to support a particular line of business that translates everything that we've talked about into terms that they consume and most importantly as well training that the associates to perform that perform in this function need to have background as a subject matter expert in the cloud provided environment back to shared responsibilities component of this and he talked ad nauseam about this this is really great so I won't go into any detail here but I wanted to share with you that we understand this well and I'll just move on to the next one which is a payout slide this slide basically says for capital one we look at shared responsibilities from both a platform perspective and an application perspective let's take the application perspective first I'm sorry the platform perspective so my team working in cloud governance we do everything that we talked about before we assess the services we ensure that they're they they meet our security requirements we work with cloud engineering teams and we provision the services and make those available to our consumers that leverage those services by way of applications so we're accountable for then assuring that we implement platform Identity and Access Management that we deploy the operating systems appropriately meaning that we provision system images rather than using the cloud provider images we provision our own so that we appropriately harden them to meet our internal standards we're accountable for what we put into the cloud so we take full responsibility for that one particular example of a control related to this is a notion of rehydration so as a virtual machine ages it takes on vulnerabilities because the vulnerability aging process and so we have a requirement to rehydrate every 60 days if you go beyond that bells and whistles go off if you go past 90 bigger whistles go off if you go to 120 the cannons go off and so forth so I think you get that so our cloud governance functioned from a centralized perspective is we make controls and scripts available that either we can run on behalf of the development community or that we can give that give it to them and they can actually run it for example there might be a requirement to apply labels or tags to all of your resources if the development community forgets to do that they can run a script to make sure they're compliant to that let's move on then to the application if you build it you own it that's the mantra at Capital One so if we offer a service to you you're golden you can use that it's been wait-listed the controls are in place but you have some accountability I'll talk a bit more about that accountability so wire cloud control is important I wanted to make sure that you had full visibility to that for Capital One it's our mission and our fiduciary responsibility if you take a standard document classification or information handling matrix you will find that your proprietary or confidential data is probably your most important asset and requires a level of protection beyond those that our company or public so what we do and how we've bifurcated this is we look at the controls in the in the cloud control catalog in three three particular areas as technical operational and management and I'll show you on the next slide how we codify those but most importantly the controls have to always be on the windows have to always be locked so that means security protocols public accessibility data encryption identity access and PCI there is no opportunity there is no tolerance for control being off so where do cloud controls originate I mentioned to you a bit earlier that they might originate from cybersecurity frameworks nest FedRAMP and so forth here's a particular small matrix of the the 14 control categories in the NIST framework where I bifurcated those by technical operational and management so we take our cloud control catalogs we look at a service that Google has provided we perform that security assessment the diagram below or the colorful green red blue chart is the actual detail of the questions that we might ask and incidentally I have to say that Google has been an extraordinary partner in this Google has our scripts they know what we choir they know when a service is ready to meet the more the higher bar for financial services industry and so they are embracing that they're working very diligently to say hey Capital One we've got this new service and they know what our requirements are so they know when to actually make the ask and finally we complete the service assessment we deliver the package now it's important to note here under item C that it's a cross-functional team we include governance we include engineering resources cyber resources architecture I am architecture and also our identity I'm sorry our information assurance third party management function where we we fully validate we have an auto-fill trail that our regulators and our internal auditors can go back and say did you ask that question google tells a lot of good things about their services but we firmly believe in trust but verify so this is the final slide I've got about 15 seconds or so and then we'll save time for QA but here's the payout and this is what what resonates with shared responsibilities from an application owner perspective here's what it means if you have an application let's take a basic multi tier architecture application where you you're going to need a load balancer a web server application server or database and file storage that application or the type of application may require that you adhere to an enterprise architecture standard there may be a defined architecture already the architecture might even say in order to meet the requirements for the architecture there are certain cloud services that you are mandated to follow so the application owner defines the application they choose the architecture they select the cloud services that are approved this is by no means the only list of what's approved at Capital One so we could put dot dot dot after you select the approved services then you become more aware of an application owner of what your actual requirements for controls are so if you pick a compute engine if you pick storage you will have some requirements for identity access data encryption and so forth so this is really the whole story there's so much detail here feel free to reach reach out to me on LinkedIn if you have some follow-up questions and we'll actually go to back to Andy to close it out for us thank you Dan so kind of in summary throw one last slide so security of the cloud is something the cloud provider secures security in the cloud is something that the cloud customer secures for their data and their content Google Cloud we look to empower you as a customer with the visibility to control and secure the things that you're responsible for and as dan talked about customers can be successful in cloud using a very thoughtful process structure and clean separations responsibilities within their own or [Music]
