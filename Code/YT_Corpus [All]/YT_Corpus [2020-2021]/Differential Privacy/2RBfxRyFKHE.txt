SO I'D LIKE TO CALL UP JASON  DEVINE AND CYNTHIA HOLLINGSWORTH TO PRESENT ON  PROPOSED 2020 DATA PRODUCTS PLAN. ^^ GOOD MORNING, I'M JASON  DEVINE, AND I AM LOOKING FOR MY COLLEAGUE CYNTHIA DAVIS  HOLLINGSWORTH. SHE DOES THE SECOND PORTION, SO  MAYBE AS I GET THROUGH SHE WILL ARRIVE.  SO, AGAIN, I'M JASON DEVINE, I WORK IN THE POPULATION  DIVISION. CYNTHIA DAVIS HOLLINGSWORTH  WORKS IN THE DECENNIAL DECISION, WE'LL UPDATE YOU ON  THE 2020 PROPOSED PLAN. DURING THE FIRST NAC  PRESENTATION IN THE SPRING WE DISCUSSED PROPOSED DATA  PRODUCTS FOR 20 AND CHALLENGES WE FACE, IMPLEMENTING A NEW  METHOD FOR DISCLOSURE AVOIDANCE THAT UTILIZES DIFFERENTIAL  PRIVACY. THIS PRESENTATION WILL BE A  CONTINUATION OF THAT DISCUSSION.  THE CENSUS BUREAU HAS A LONG HISTORY OF PROTECTING  INFORMATION PROVIDED BY RESPONDENTS, OVER THE DECADES  MORE AND MORE GRAINS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED.  ADVANCES IN DATA SCIENCE, POWERFUL COMPUTERS HAS  INCREASED RISK OF IDENTIFYING INDIVIDUALS FROM PUBLISHED  STATISTICS. TO MITIGATE NEW METHODS WILL BE  EMPLOYED FOR THE 2020 CENSUS. OUR GOAL FOR THE 2020 CENSUS  DATA PRODUCTS REMAINS TO MEET DATA USER NEEDS WHILE  IMPLEMENTING NEW DISCLOSURE AVOIDANCE METHOD.  THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES. IN THE PRESENTATION TODAY WE'LL  DISCUSS 2020 CENSUS DATA PRODUCTS THAT WILL BE SUPPORTED  BY THE CURRENT DIFFERENTIALLY PRIVATE DISCLOSURE SYSTEM,  DEVELOPING SYSTEMS FOR PROTECTING 2020 CENSUS PRODUCTS  THAT INDUCE TABULATIONINGS TO PROVIDE COUNTS BY RACE AND  HISPANIC ORIGIN GROUPS, TRIBES, POPULATION BY HOUSEHOLD FAMILY  TYPES. THOSE PRODUCTS NOT SUPPORTED,  WE'RE CONDUCTINGOUT REACH TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE MUST HAVE  TABLES ARE IN TERMS OF DEKALE AND GEOGRAPHY.  STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK COMBINED WITH REVIEW OF ACCESS RATES,  FEEDBACK WAS COLLECTED THROUGH JULY 2018 NOTICE.  ADDITIONAL OUTREACH HAS BEEN CONDUCTED TO OBTAIN INPUT FROM  DATA YOURSERS. A 2010 DEMONSTRATION DATA  PRODUCT FILE HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AND RELEASED THAT IS ALLOWING  EXTERNAL DATA USERS TO EXAMINE IMPACT ON ACCURACY OF  DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY. WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THIS  PRODUCT AND OPPORTUNITIES IT PRESENTS FOR EXTERNAL DATA  USERS, A NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCE WORKSHOP IS PLANNED AND  CYNTHIA WILL PROVIDE MORE ON THE DEMOGRAPHICS, DEMONSTRATION  PRODUCT, 2010 DEMONSTRATION PRODUCT, OUTREACH AND WHAT IS PLANNED.  STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK COMBINED WITH REVIEW OF TABLE ACCESS  RATES, SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT KNOWLEDGE IS INFORMING THE  DEVELOPMENT OF THE 2020 DATA PRODUCTS.  THE 20 DATA PRODUCTS WILL INCLUDE INITIAL SET OF PRODUCTS  MADE UP OF LEGALLY MANDATED PRODUCTS, PRODUCTS WITH TABLES  EXPECTED TO BE SUPPORTED BY THE CURRENT DIFFERENTIALLY PRIVATE  DISCLOSURE AVOIDANCE SYSTEM. A LATER SET WILL INCLUDE TABLES  PROTECTED USING OTHER FORMAL PRIVACY SYSTEMS.  THE DESIGN OF THESE PRODUCTS WILL BE INFORMED BY FEEDBACK,  INFORMATION WE ALREADY HAVE, ADDITIONAL FEEDBACK THAT WE RECEIVE.  ALL THE PRODUCTS WE'LL DISCUSS INCLUDE DATA FOR THE 50 STATES,  DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, PUERTO RICO.  WHILE WORK, ON DATA PRODUCT PLANS FOR PERFECTION AND VIRGIN  ISLAND AREAS THEY ARE NOT COVERED IN THIS PRESENTATION.  IN THE SPRING NAC MEETING WE WENT OVER PROPOSE THE DATA  PRODUCTS FOR 2020 AND HOW THEY FOLLOW STRUCTURE SIMILAR TO THE  2010 CENSUS. THIS SLIDE THE PROPOSED 2020  DATA PRODUCTS ARE LIST INNED THREE CATEGORIES, AT THE  CURRENT DISCLOSURE SYSTEM EITHER SUPPORTS OR IS BEING  EXPANDED TO SUPPORT, INCLUDING TWO LEGALLY MANDATED PRODUCTS, APPORTIONATE PRODUCT,  REDISTRICTING FILE, PL 94-117, THE STATE COUNTS ARE KEPT AS  THEY WERE ENUMERATE. THIS CATEGORY ALSO INCLUDES  DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILES, DEMOGRAPHIC AND HOUSING  CHARACTERISTICS FILE, CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT  DEMOGRAPHIC AND HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS FILE.  NEXT IS TABLE AND PRODUCTS WHERE WE INDUSTRIAL TO DEVELOP  OTHER FORMAL PRIVACY ALGORITHMS, ALSO BASED ON  DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY, THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR RELIEF,  INCLUDING DETAILED RACE AND HISPANIC ORIGIN TABLES, SOME  FAME TABLES IN SUMMARY TABLE 1 IN 2010, SUMMARY FILE 2,  AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVE SUMMARY FILE, PUBLIC  HUGHES MICRODATA SAMPLE FINAL. FINAL CATEGORY IS TWO PRODUCTS  WE DO NOT PLAN FOR 2020, MUCH DATA INCLUDED IN THEM WILL BE  AVAILABLE ELSEWHERE AND THESE INCLUDE SUMMARY OF POPULATION  HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS CPH 1 AND CPH 2.  DURING THE PRESENTATION WE'LL FOCUS ON THOSE PRODUCTS THAT  THE CURRENT DISCLOSURE AVOIDANCE SYSTEM SUPPORTS OR IS  BEING EXPANDED TO SUPPORT. THE APPORTIONMENT PRODUCT IS  THE FIRST RELEASE OF THE 2020 CENSUS, RESIDENT POPULATION  PLUS OVERSEAS FEDERAL EMPLOYEES, DEPENDENTS LIVING  WITH THEM. APPORTIONMENT PRODUCT IS  PRODUCE THE PRIOR TO DISCLOSURE AVOIDANCE BEING APPLIED, NOT  IMPACTED BY METHOD USE. REDISTRICTING FILE SATISFIES  PUBLIC LIFE 94-171, PROVIDE DATA TO GOVERNORS AND  LEADERSHIP AND PUBLIC BODIES RESPONSE FOR REDISTRICTING IN  EACH OF THE 50 STATES FOR REDISTRICTING PURPOSE, WILL BE  THE FIRST FILE RELEASE THAT WILL INCLUDE DEMOGRAPHIC AND  HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS ABOUT DETAILED GEOGRAPHIC AREAS.  PROFILES WILL PROVIDE CRITICAL DEMOGRAPHIC AND HOUSING  CHARACTERISTICS, LOCAL COMMUNITIES, SOON AFTER RELEASE  OF REDISTRICTING FILE AS POSSIBLE.  DEMOGRAPHIC AND HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS FILE, DHC WILL  INCLUES TABLES PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED IN SUMMARY FILE 1.  CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT DEMOGRAPHIC AND HOUSING  CHARACTERISTICS FILE PROVIDES A RETABULATION OF THE  DEMOGRAPHIC AND HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS.  I'LL GO INTO DETAIL AS I GO THROUGH THE PRESENTATION.  THE REDISTRICTING FILE WILL BE THE SECOND PRODUCT RELEASED  FROM THE 2020 CENSUS, COMING AFTER RELEASE OF THE  APPORTIONMENT PRODUCT, DETAILED GEOGRAPHIC AREAS.  DATA IDENTIFIED BY STATES IS REQUIRED FOR REDISTRICTING  UNDER 94-171, INCLUDES DATA AT THE CENSUS BLOCK LEVEL ON  VOTING AGE POPULATION, RACE, HISPANIC ORIGIN, OCCUPANCY  STATUS, GROUP QUARTERS POPULATION FOR SEVEN MAJOR GQ  TYPES, MUST BE RELEASED IN ONE YEAR OF CENSUS DAY.  ONE UPDATE FOR THE 2020 REDISTRICTING FILE IS ADDITION  FOR SEVEN TYPES, PROVIDED IN A SEPARATE PRODUCT IN 2010 TO  MEET NEEDS. THE PROTOTYPE WAS MADE  AVAILABLE IN MARCH, THE FIRST 2020 CENSUS PRODUCT USED IN NEW DISCLOSURE AVOIDANCE  METHODOLOGY. 2018 PROTOTYPE IS AVAILABLE ON  THE WEB PAGE, ON CENSUS.GOV, AND PROVIDES DETAILS ABOUT WHAT  INCLUDED IN THIS PRODUCT. HERE'S A SCREEN SHOT OF WHAT  THE COVER OF THAT DOCUMENT LOOKS LIKE, AND I'M NOT GOING  INTO DETAIL BUT THEY WILL ALLOW US TO FOCUS MORE ON THE DEMOGRAPHIC AND HOUSING  CHARACTERISTICS FILE AND WILL INCLDE TABLES IN SUMMARY FILE  1, AGE, SEX, RACE, LATINO ORIGIN, HOUSEHOLD TYPE, FAMILY  TYPE, RELATIONSHIP TO HOUSEHOLDER, SOME SUBJECTS WILL  BE PROVIDED BY MAJOR O ANDB RACE, ETHNICITY GROUPS, GROUP  QUARTERS, HOUSING OCCUPANCY, HOUSING TENURE, AND DATA IN DHC  AVAILABLE FOR MANY LEVELS OF GEOGRAPHY, DATA AVAILABLE FOR  ALL THE GEOGRAPHIES AT AND ABOVE THE LOWEST LEVEL THEY ARE  RELEASED FOR, IN MANY CASES AT THE CENSUS BLOCK LEVEL.  DHC WILL NOT INCLUDE TABLES THAT PROVIDE COUNTS BY DETAILED  RACE, HISPANIC ORIGIN, TRIBES TRIBES, DUE TO DIFFERENTIAL  PRIVACY FOR PRIVACY PROTECTION BUT WE'RE DEVELOPING SOLUTION  FOR PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE THESE TABLES.  DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILES WILL PROVIDE CRITICAL  CHARACTERISTICS ABOUT LOCAL COMMUNITIES FROM SELECTED DHC,  SOON AFTER RELEASE AFTER REDISTRICTING PRODUCTS AS  POSSIBLE, SUBJECTS INCLUDE FIVE YEAR AGE GROUP, SEX, RACE,  HISPANICS OR LATINO ORIGINAL, RELATIONSHIP TO HOUSEHOLDER,  HOUSING OCCUPANCY AND TENURE, AVAILABLE AT THE PLACE AND MINOR CIVIL DIVISION LEVEL.  REDISTRICTING FILE IN THE DEMOGRAPHIC AND HOUSING  CHARACTERISTICS FILE INCLUDE A LOT OF DEMOGRAPHIC AND HOUSING  DATA WITH MUCH BEING AVAILABLE AT THE CENSUS BLOCK LEVEL.  THIS SLIDE WE SHOW WHAT WILL BE AVAILABLE AT THE LOWEST LEVEL  OF GEOGRAPHY PROPOSED TO BE AVAILABLE FOR, IN MANY CASES  TABLES REPEATED BY MAJOR RACE, HISPANIC ORIGIN GROUP, ASTERISK  ALLOWS YOU TO SEE WHICH TABLES THESE ARE.  CENSUS BLOCK LEVEL TOTAL POPULATION, URBAN RURAL  DESIGNATION, SEX, RACE, HISPANIC OR LATINO ORIGIN, SEX  BY FIVE YEAR AND OTHER AGE GROUPS IT RATED BY RACE, SEX BY  SINGLE YEAR OF AGE UNDER 20, RELATIONSHIP TO HOUSEHOLDER,  HOUSEHOLDS BY HOUSEHOLDER CHARACTERISTICS, AGAIN ITER RATED  BY AGES, TENURE, SIZE, GROUP QUARTERS POPULATION BY SEX AND  AGE FOR MAJOR TYPES, MEDIAN AGE FOR VARIOUS GROUPS.  YOU CAN SEE ASTERISK INDICATES WHERE REPEATED BY MAJOR RACE  GROUPS. POPULATION BY SINGLE YEAR OF  AGE, HISPANIC OR LATINO ORIGIN, BY PRESENCE OF CHILDREN, COUNTY  LEVEL HOUSEHOLD SIZE BY TYPE, PRESENCE OF CHILDREN, AGE OF  HOUSEHOLDER, PEOPLE OF SPECIFIC AGES, STATE LEVEL A GROUP  QUARTERS FILE WITH MORE DETAILED BY SEX, BY AGE, BY MAJOR GROUP QUARTERS TYPE.  PRIOR TO THIS MEETING WE PROVIDED YOU WITH THE PROPOSED  DEMOGRAPHIC AND HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS FILE PRODUCT  SPECIFICATIONS, THIS SPECIFICATION ALLOWS YOU TO SEE  LIST OF TABLES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN DHC, CROSSWALK FROM  2010 SUMMARY FILE, TABLE NUMBERS TO 2020 DHC TABLES AND  NUMBERS, LIST OF TABLES NEW IN THE DHC, SHOWS TABLES IN SF 1,  NOT IN DHC, SHOWS TABLES PROPOSED FOR INCLUSION IN  DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILES, AND PROVIDES EACH OF THE TABLES  PROPOSE AND LOWEST LEVELS OF GEOGRAPHY.  AND WE'VE ADDED A FEW THINGS, I'LL GO OVER THAT, FROM VERSION  OF THIS SPREADSHEET FOR CSAC, EXPANDED TO INCLUDE INFORMATION  ON DEMONSTRATION PRODUCTS SO YOU CAN LOOK IN THE CROSSWALK  FILE AND SEE WHAT TABLES WILL BE AVAILABLE IN THE  DEMONSTRATION PRODUCT MADE AVAILABLE TO EXTERNAL USERS.  THIS SLIDE PROVIDES SCREEN SHOT OF KEY TAB AND DHC TABLE CROSSWALK.  LET ME LOOK BACK REAL QUICK. THIS IS THE OLD SCREEN SHOT OF  THE OLD VERSION OF THIS CROSSWALK FILE BUT I'LL WALK  YOU THROUGH WHAT'S AVAILABLE AS IT CURRENTLY EXISTS, THAT WAS  THE FILE MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU WITH THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION  IN IT. SO, CROSSWALK FILE HAS BEEN  EXPANDED FROM FIVE TABS PREPARED AVAILABLE IN THE CSAC  CROSSWALK TABLE TO INCLUDE SEVEN TABS NOW, INCLUDES READ  ME TAB, TWO TABS SHOW WHAT'S AVAILABLE IN THE PL PRODUCT,  TABS THAT LET YOU SEE WHAT'S IN THE DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE, MORE  DETAIL ABOUT THE TABLE FROM DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE, WHAT'S  AVAILABLE IN THE DEMOGRAPHIC AND HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS  FILE, LIST OF TABLES, AND THEN MORE DETAIL ABOUT WHAT'S  AVAILABLE IN THOSE TABLES. YOU CAN SEE IF YOU LOOK AT  CROSS THE WORK SHEET THERE'S THE TABS THAT LET YOU SELECT  DIFFERENT OPTIONS TO SEE WHAT'S IN THE PL PRODUCT, OR DHC, OR MORE  DETAIL ABOUT WHAT'S IN THOSE TABLES.  THIS SCREEN SHOT SHOWS THE FIRST FEW TABLES, IF YOU  LOOK AT -- SCROLL DOWN, THROUGH THE FIRST FEW TABLES, P 7,  YOU'LL SEE NOW THAT TABLE IS -- THE NUMBER, IT'S GONE  FROM BEING BLOCK LEVEL TO COUNTY LEVEL TABLE.  THERE'S SOME INFORMATION THAT CAN BE GAINED BY LOOKING AND  UNDERSTANDING, I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT SORT OF THE FORMAT OR THE NOMENCLATURE THAT  PROVIDES THAT INFORMATION. AND AGAIN YOU CAN SEE EXAMPLE  OF TABLES NOT INCLUDED IN THE DEMOGRAPHIC AND HOUSING  CHARACTERISTICS FILE PROVIDED IN FILE 1 IN 2010, IN THE  SECOND COLUMN WITH NA, NOT AVAILABLE IN DHC BUT THEY ARE  AVAILABLE IN THE PL PRODUCT, SO WHILE THEY ARE NOT INCLUDED IN  THE DHC, THEY ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PL PRODUCT SO  YOU'RE STILL GETTING THAT INFORMATION AT THE BLOCK LEVEL.  AND ALSO SHOWS WHAT LEVEL OF GEOGRAPHY, LOWEST LEVEL IT'S  AVAILABLE FOR. AND IF YOU'RE TO SEE THE NEWER  REVISED VERSION, THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL COLUMN WHETHER OR  NOT THIS WAS INCLUDED IN THE DEMONSTRATION PRODUCT.  THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF IF YOU LOOK AT THE CROSSWALK AND FIND  THE TABLE YOU'RE INTERESTED IN, YOU CAN LOOK AT THE NUMBER,  DESIGNATOR FOR THAT TABLE, GO TO THE NEXT TAB AND YOU CAN  LOOK AND SEE MORE DETAILS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO BE PROVIDED.  IF YOU LOOKED AT THE FIRST COLUMN, FIRST TAB, WERE  INTERESTED TO SEE MORE ABOUT WHAT WAS IN P3, WENT TO THIS  TAB, YOU CAN THEN SEE THIS WAS THE UNIVERSE FOR THIS TABLE WAS TOTAL POPULATION, AND  PROVIDED COUNTS AT THE BLOCK LEVEL FOR THESE RACE GROUPS. JUST AS IN 2010 THE TABLE  NUMBERS ALSO TELL YOU WHAT THE LOWEST LEVEL THE TABLE LEVEL OF GEOGRAPHY WILL BE  AVAILABLE. P MEANS POPULATION TABLE  AVAILABLE AT THE CENSUS BLOCK LEVEL.  PCT POPULATION TABLE AVAILABLE AT THE CENSUS TRACK LEVEL, PCO  IS COUNTY LEVEL, PSD STATE LEVEL, H IS HOUSING TABLE AT  THE CENSUS BLOCK LEVEL, HCT IS HOUSING AVAILABLE AT THE TEN  SUSS CENSUS TRACT LEVEL, LOOK FOR  YOURSELF AT THE TABLES THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED AS PART OF THIS  INITIAL SET OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE BEING PROTECTED WITH THE EXISTING DISCLOSURE AVOIDANCE  SYSTEM. SOME TABLES ARE REPEATED,  TABLES WHEN REPEATED BY THESE GROUPS ARE IDENTIFIED WITH THE  LETTERS A THROUGH I, SAME MAJOR RACE AND HISPANIC ORIGIN GROUPS  REPEATED FOR 2010. THESE INCLUDE WHITE ALONE,  BLACK, AFRICAN-AMERICAN ALONE, AMERICAN INDIAN ALASKA NATIVE  ALONE, ASIAN ALONE, NATIVE HAWAIIAN OR PACIFIC ISLANDER  ALONE, SOME OTHER RACE ALONE, TWO OR MORE RACES, HISPANIC OR  LATINO, WHITE ALONE, NOT HISPANIC OR LATINO.  THIS SCREEN SHOT SHOWS DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE TAB, WHAT  TABLES FROM THE DHC WILL BE INCLUDED IN DEMOGRAPHIC  PROFILES, AS WITH DHC YOU HAVE ALSO THE TAB THAT  LETS THAT LETS YOU SEE WHAT'S  AVAILABLE IN THE DEMOGRAPHIC TABLES.  THIS WAS A PLACE HOLDER WE HAD ON THE EARLIER VERSION OF OUR  PRESENTATION, AS WE WERE UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE TIMING OF  THE RELEASE FOR DEMONSTRATION PRODUCT, AS I SAID WE HAVE  RELEASED THAT PRODUCT AND THAT IS AVAILABLE NOW FOR THE  PUBLIC. SO OF COURSE WE WILL STILL HAVE  OTHER ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS, THESE WILL INCLUDE CENSUS  BRIEFS, CENSUS BRIEFS WILL PROVIDE SUMMARIES OF POPULATION  HOUSING DATA, DISPLAY DATA THROUGH MAPS, GRAPHS, FIGURES,  POPULATION HOUSING TABLES, WHICH WILL PROVIDE POPULATION  DATA COMPARISONS TO PREVIOUS CENSUS, AND SPECIAL REPORTS  WHICH WILL PROVIDE MORE IN DEPTH ANALYSIS OF POPULATION  HOUSING DATA, NOT AVAILABLE IN OTHER DATA PRODUCTS.  AND THIS SLIDE SUMMARIZES WHAT I'VE JUST GONE OVER.  THE FIRST SET OF TABLES, APPORTIONMENT PRODUCT,  REDISTRICTING, DEMOGRAPHIC AND DHC WILL BE SUPPORTED BY  CURRENT DISCLOSURE AVOIDANCE SYSTEM.  THE APPORTIONMENT PRODUCT IS NOT IMPACTED BY DISCLOSURE  METHOD USED. TABLES THAT REQUIRE COMPLEX  PERSON HOUSEHOLD JOINTS, AMERICAN  INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVE TRIBES AND GROUPS WE CONTINUE TO WORK  ON WAYS TO INCLUDE THESE TABLES THAT WILL MEET USERS NEEDS AND  MAINTAIN DATA CONFIDENTIALITY. NEXT SET ARE SOURCED FROM OTHER  TABLES, WE CONTINUE TO DISCUSS RELEASE OF 2020 CENSUS PROMISE  FILE. LAST TWO TABLES ARE TABLES  WE'RE PRODUCING NOT TO PRODUCE. THANK YOU.  I'LL TURN IT OVER TO CYNTHIA WHO WILL COMPLETE THE PRESENTATION. ^^ THANK YOU, JASON.  GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE. SO, I WILL TAKE THIS  OPPORTUNITY NOW TO UPDATE YOU ON OUR OUTREACH ACTIVITIES THAT  WE'VE BEEN CONDUCTING SINCE WE LAST SPOKE TO YOU BACK IN THE  SPRING. WE'VE CONTINUED TO PARTICIPATE  IN SEVERAL MEETINGS AND CONFERENCES PROVIDING UPDATES  ON OUR DATA PRODUCTS PLANNING, AS WELL AS IMPLEMENTING THE NEW  DISCLOSURE AVOIDANCE METHODOLOGY.  THESE MEETINGS INCLUDE PAA, PANEL ON PRIVACY PROTECTION,  MOST RECENTLY PRE-SENTING AT CSAC, CONSULTATION WITH  AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVE.  PARTICIPATING IN THE TRIBAL CONSULTATIONS, FOR EXAMPLE,  HAVE PROVIDED IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR FEEDBACK ON  HOW THE TRIBES USE THE DECENNIAL DATA PRODUCTS AND TO  ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS REGARDING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF  NEW DISCLOSURE METHODOLOGY. AS PART OF OUR MOST RECENT  CONVERSATION WITH CSAC, WE WERE ABLE TO QUICKLY IMPLEMENT ONE  OF THE SUGGESTIONS THAT WERE PROVIDED TO US, WHICH WAS A WAY  TO PROVIDE A ONE-STOP SHOP LOCATION ON THE WEBSITE WHERE  ONE CAN GO TO AND FIND ONE COHESIVE LOCATION OF GETTING  UPDATES ON WHERE WE ARE WITH THE 2020 DATA PRODUCTS  PLANNING. AND HOPEFULLY IF WE HAVE ENOUGH  TIME, I HOPE WE CAN GET TO THE WEBSITE AND I CAN WALK YOU THROUGH THAT.  I WANT TO POINT OUT IF WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME, WHENEVER YOU  GO TO WWW.CENSUS.GOV, IN THE SEARCH BAR, IF YOU WOULD JUST  TYPE IN 2020 DISCLOSURE AVOIDANCE, OR 2020 CENSUS DATA PRODUCTS, OR  2010 DEMONSTRATION DATA PRODUCTS, IT WILL GET YOU TO  THE WEB PAGE WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO GO TO TO FIND THAT INFORMATION IN ONE PLACE. AGAIN, HOPEFULLY WE CAN DO THAT.  IN ADDITION TO PARTICIPATING IN CONFERENCES AND MEETINGS WE  RELEASED INFORMATION REGARDING IMPLEMENTATION STATUS OF 2020  DISCLOSURE AVOIDANCE SYSTEM, WHAT WE REFER TO AS THE DAS, CODE BASE FOR  2018 END TO END CENSUS TEST, SAMPLE RUNS ON A THE 1940 DAY.  JOHN ABOWD MAY SPEAK TO THIS LATER IN HIS PRESENTATION THIS  MORNING. I WANT TO ALSO HIGHLIGHT THE  EXPANSION OF THE 2020 CENSUS MEMO SERIES, TO NOW INCLUDE  FORMAL DECISIONS ON THE DAS IMPLEMENTATION FOR THE 2020  CENSUS DATA PRODUCTS. AS REMINDER, THE MEMO SERIES  DOCUMENTS SIGNIFICANT DECISIONS, ACTIONS, AND  ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE 2020 CENSUS PROGRAM.  TO DATE, WE HAVE THREE MEMOS THAT HAVE BEEN RELEASED, AND  CAN BE FOUND AT THE LINK PROVIDED ABOVE.  THE FIRST MEMO IS THE DECISION ON THE DAS PARAMETERS RELEVANT  TO THE 2018 END TO END CENSUS TEST WHERE WE PRODUCED  PROTOTYPE PL94. AS JASON MENTIONED, THE  DECISION THE DAS WOULD RUN AFTER THE APPORTIONMENT DATA  ARE RELEASE THE. AND MOST RECENTLY, RELEVANT TO  THE PRODUCTION OF THE 2010 DEMONSTRATION DATA PRODUCTS, WE  JUST RECENTLY RELEASED DECISION MEMO ON THE DAS PARAMETERS AS  WELL AS PRIVACY BUDGET FOR THAT DATA PRODUCT.  AND THEN THE VERY LAST BULLET ON MY SLIDE HERE, THIS IS  REGARDING THE TWO-DAY WORKSHOP ON THE 2020 CENSUS DATA  PRODUCTS, SCHEDULED TO BE HELD ON DECEMBER 11 AND 12 OF THIS YEAR.  IT WILL PROVIDE AN UNIT TO CONTINUE DISCUSSION WITH DATA  USER COMMUNITY, SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND THEIR NEEDS AND USES  OF THE DECENNIAL DATA. THIS WILL INFORM US IN MAKING  FINAL DECISIONS ON THE 2020 DATA PRODUCTS.  SPECIFICALLY, WE WILL BE DISCUSSING THE ASSESSMENT OF  THE 2010 DEMONSTRATION DATA PRODUCTS, AND HOW IT IMPACTS  THEIR NEEDS AND THEIR USES. MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE SPECIFIC  WORKSHOP IS AVAILABLE ON THE CN STAT WEB PAGE, ACCESSIBLE FROM  THE 2020 CENSUS DATA PRODUCTS PAGE, AGAIN I HOPE WE CAN TAKE  A LOOK AT THE WEBSITE TO GET YOU THERE.  AT THEY HAVE PUT OUT A CALL FOR  INPUT NOW. I WANT TO ENCOURAGE FOLKS TO  GET THERE SO YOU CAN GET REGISTERED AND WAYS FOR YOU TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS WORKSHOP.  SO BACK TO THE 2010 DEMONSTRATION DATA PRODUCTS  THAT WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT, REFERRING TO, WHEN WE FIRST  DEVELOPED THESE SLIDES WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE PLAN TO  RELEASE, BUT AGAIN WE'RE HAPPY TO REPORT LAST TUESDAY, OCTOBER  29, WE DID IN FACT RELEASE THE DEMONSTRATION DATA PRODUCTS.  THEY REPRESENT TWO PRODUCTS SPECIFICALLY, THAT IS THE PL94,  REDISTRICTING DATA, AS WELL AS WHAT WE'RE NOW REFERRING TO AS  DEMOGRAPHIC AND HOUSING CHARACTERISTICS FILE.  I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS FILE REPRESENTS ONLY  SELECTED TABLES FROM THE PROPOSED DHC, AND IT WAS BASED  ON WHERE WE STAND RIGHT NOW WITH THE CURRENT DAS  IMPLEMENTATION. IF WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY AND,  SORRY, I UNDERSTAND WE STARTED A LITTLE BIT EARLY SO I DIDN'T  GO OVER TO THE TABLE TO ASK IF WE WOULD BE ABLE TO GO TO THE  WEBSITE LIVE, DOES THAT PRESENT A PROBLEM?  IF IT DOES, IT'S OKAY. I CAN KEEP GOING.  CENSUS.GOV. AWESOME.  SO IF YOU GO TO THE SEARCH BAR, TYPE IN 2020 CENSUS DATA  PRODUCTS, IN THE INTEREST OF TIME, AND SCROLL DOWN TO THE SEARCH  RESULTS, JUST A LITTLE. HOPEFULLY IT'S THE VERY FIRST  OPTION. YES.  IF YOU WOULD GO TO THAT PAGE .  THANK YOU. SO, THIS IS A START OF WHERE I  ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GO TO, TO GET UPDATED STATUS ON WHERE WE  STAND WITH 2020 CENSUS DATA PRODUCTS.  ON THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE UNDER RELATED INFORMATION, YOU CAN  ALSO GET TO THE -- ANY INFORMATION REGARDING THE  DISCLOSURE AVOIDANCE. BUT I WANT TO FOCUS ON THIS  PAGE RIGHT HERE, SO IF YOU SCROLL DOWN YOU'LL SEE RECENT  PUBLICATIONS, NOT AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST BUT JUST A START.  SCROLL DOWN A LITTLE BIT MORE YOU WILL SEE THE TAB FOR THE  2010 DEMONSTRATION DATA PRODUCTS.  SO, WHILE IT MAY NOT LOOK LIKE, IT IS A CLICKABLE LINK.  THERE WE GO. IF YOU WOULD GO THERE.  THIS DESCRIBES THE PURPOSE OF THE DATA DEMONSTRATION  PRODUCTS. GO DOWN MORE.  THE WAY THAT WE'RE COLLECTING FEEDBACK IS THROUGH THIS E-MAIL ADDRESS, DCMD .2010. DEMONSTRATION.DATA.PRODUCTS@CEN  SUS.GOV. YOU'LL FIND A COPY ON THE NAC  WEBSITE AND THE CROSSWALK THAT JASON HAS BEEN REFERRED TO AS  WELL AS BEFORE YOU GET TO THE DATA WE GIVE YOU A READ ME FILE  SO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW THE DATA WORK.  WE HAVE TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION THAT ACOMPANIES DATA, OBVIOUSLY  WE GET YOU TO THE FOLDER WITH THE DATA.  WE'VE RELEASED FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS, SO TO HELP GUIDE YOU  IN UNDERSTANDING HOW TO USE THE DATA, THE PURPOSE, AND TO GIVE  YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION.  AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST I WOULD LIKE TO CLICK ON THE BLOG WHICH  IS THE ACTUAL ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE DATA RELEASE.  AND THIS BLOG WAS WRITTEN BY JOHN AND TORY.  THANK YOU. AND WITHIN THE BLOG ITSELF  AGAIN IT GOES INTO WHY WE DID THIS, AND ITS PURPOSE, BUT IF  YOU SCROLL DOWN THERE IS IN THE VERY LAST SENTENCE I THINK,  THERE IS TEXT AROUND THE TWO-DAY WORKSHOP, AND IT DOES  PROVIDE THE LINK TO CN STAT. IF YOU WOULD CLICK ON THAT.  AND JUST RECENTLY I BELIEVE IT WAS LAST THURSDAY OR FRIDAY, CN  STAT RELEASED INPUT CALL FOR THIS WORKSHOP.  SO IF YOU LOOK UNDER UPCOMING EVENTS, IN THE MIDDLE, SCROLL DOWN CALL FOR INPUT WORKSHOP ON PRODUCTS, AND LEARN MORE, AND REGISTER.  THAT'S WHERE YOU WOULD GO TO SEE THIS SPECIFIC ANNOUNCEMENT  AROUND THE WORKSHOP, AND PROVIDE -- IF YOU COULD CLICK  ON THAT -- AND PROVIDE A WAY TO REGISTER. AND THAT ENDS MY PRESENTATION.  THANK YOU. ^^ STUART IS OUR DISCUSSANT, HE WILL GO, AND THEN WE'LL HAVE OUR QUESTIONS.  WE ALREADY HAVE A FEW NAME TAGS UP FOR THOSE.  ^^ I'VE BEEN ASKED TO BE THE DISCUSSANT, THIS IS STUART MICHAELS.  I'M GOING TO FIRST OF ALL -- THANK YOU, JASON AND CYNTHIA FOR THIS.  THIS IS OUR SECOND PRESENTATION.  AND I WAS ASKED TO BE THE DISCUSSANT THE FIRST TIME.  I WONDER WHETHER I'M THE RIGHT PERSON, BUT I SAID YES, AND I  THINK IN A CERTAIN WAY I AM THE RIGHT PERSON, BECAUSE I HAVE --  I'M SORT OF IN THE MIDDLE. I HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF  EXPERIENCE. I'M A RESEARCHER, SORT OF I  WORK WITH DATA, I DON'T USUALLY WORK DIRECTLY WITH CENSUS DATA,  BUT MUCH OF THE DATA THAT I DO WORK WITH IS IN SOME WAY  DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY RELATED TO CENSUS.  AND THE CENSUS DATA FOR DATA USERS AND RESEARCHERS LIKE  MYSELF STANDS AS A KIND OF INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT  SORT OF GOLD STANDARD MAY BE TOO STRONG A WORD BUT IT GOES  BEYOND ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE ABLE TO PRODUCE IN TERMS  OF DETAIL AND LEVEL OF GRANULARITY, SO IT'S IMPORTANT  FOR UNDERSTANDING EVERYTHING ELSE.  WHEN WE DID A SURVEY OF THE POPULATION, ET CETERA, WE USE  CENSUS TO CALIBRATE OUR RESULTS, TO CORRECT, ET CETERA.  SO THIS IS A LONG HISTORY, BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHER USERS, SO  I JUST GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS I THINK WE'RE GOING  THROUGH A HUGE CHANGE, THIS IS A REALLY INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT  PERIOD OF REALIZING THERE ARE CHALLENGES FACED BY THE CENSUS BUREAU, AND TO  PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE DATA THAT THEY COLLECT  THERE'S SOME -- AND BUT THAT HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE  OUTPUT, THE DATA THAT IS AVAILABLE AND PRESENTED.  AND I THINK THE NAC IS A GREAT PLACE FOR DISCUSSION OF THESE  PROBLEMS BECAUSE WE REPRESENT MANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF USERS  WHO HAVE DIFFERENT INTERESTS. AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS I  WANT TO SAY, I MEAN, IT'S TAKEN ME A WHILE SO I'M IMAGINING FOR  SOME OTHER PEOPLE GETTING YOUR HEAD AROUND WHAT'S GOING ON AND  WHAT THE ISSUES ARE IS A PROCESS.  WE'RE GOING TO ASK -- TO HAVE A DISCUSSION LATER ABOUT  DISCLOSURE AVOIDANCE BUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING UP FRONT, IN SOME  WAYS MAYBE FOR US THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING, WHAT ARE  THE IMPLICATIONS, WHAT PRACTICALLY IS THIS GOING TO  MEAN FOR THE WORK THAT WE ALL DO.  I WOULD SAY THIS IS ANOTHER REASON I'M UNCERTAIN WHETHER I'M THE BEST PERSON.  I THINK WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS AND USES.  I REALLY HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED. I'VE BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE FOR  A LONG TIME NOW, 5 1/2 YEARS, THAT I HAVE HUGE RESPECT FOR  THE CENSUS BUREAU, AND I REALLY APPLAUD THEIR  COMMITMENT TO PROTECTING THEIR DATA AND SERVING -- MAKING THAT DATA AS PUBLICLY USEFUL AS POSSIBLE.  SO THERE'S A CERTAIN LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY THAT'S GOING ON  HERE, WHERE WE'RE BEING TOLD WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS ARE.  SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO GET YOUR HEAD AROUND WHAT THEY ARE, BUT  -- AND THE OTHER THING I WANT TO UNDERLINE RIGHT AT THE  BEGINNING, BECAUSE THIS IS MY -- ALMOST MY TAKEAWAY, IS THAT  I THINK THIS IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT MOMENT.  AND ACTUALLY IT'S A MOMENT WHERE THE NAC COULD PLAY A  REALLY IMPORTANT ROLE. IN OTHER WORDS, THESE DECISIONS  ARE IN PROCESS. I HOPE THAT WAS CLEAR FROM THE  PRESENTATION THAT THERE ARE A SET OF PRODUCTS WHICH WILL BE  PRODUCED FROM 2020, MANY OF THEM, A NUMBER OF THEM, BECAUSE  THEY ARE MANDATED, AND THEY HAVE TO BE PRODUCED.  BUT THEN THERE'S THE USUAL SET OF PRODUCTS THAT WE'VE BEEN  USED TO OVER THE YEARS, AND THAT PEOPLE USE IN VARIOUS WAYS  THAT SOME OF WHICH WILL BE AVAILABLE AND SOME OF WHICH  WILL NOT. AND THEN I DO WANT TO UNDERLINE  FOR PEOPLE THAT THERE'S THEN A WHOLE SET OF OPEN QUESTIONS.  RIGHT? THERE ARE FUTURE DECISIONS.  THIS IS AN ONGOING PROCESS. AND SO AGAIN THAT'S WHERE I  THINK WE HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY, WITH OTHERS, IN TRYING TO  UNDERSTAND AND INFLUENCE THOSE DECISIONS AND HELP THE CENSUS  BUREAU MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS POSSIBLE.  SO, I THINK I'VE SAID EVERYTHING THAT WAS ON THIS  SLIDE. I DON'T KNOW -- YOU KNOW, I  THINK WE'RE COMING AT THIS FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE, AND I  MUST ADMIT, YOU KNOW, THIS TURNS ME ON IN A CERTAIN WAY,  THE NERD PART OF ME GETS KIND OF EXCITED, BUT I ALSO VERY  QUICKLY REALIZE THAT THIS STARTS TO GO WAY BEYOND WHAT  I'M USED TO AND WHAT I CAN REALLY UNDERSTAND.  SO, I GUESS WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS SORT OF PUT THIS IN ENTER -- PERSPECTIVE, WHAT I FEEL  LIKE HAS HAPPENED, I'M USED TO COLLECTING DATA AND PROTECTING  INDIVIDUALS' PRIVACY AND DATA. BUT BECAUSE WE DO THIS ON SMALL  DATA SETS, OR WHAT FOR US FEEL LIKE LARGE DATA SETS, THAT HAVE  NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SCALE OF A COMPLETE CENSUS DECENNIAL OR  EVEN THE ACS AND SOME OF THE OTHER MAJOR SURVEYS THE CENSUS  BUREAU DOES, THE ISSUES ARE REALLY DIFFERENT.  WHAT I'M GETTING, I HOPE -- AND I LOOK FORWARD TO BEING  CORRECTED IF I'M WRONG, IS THAT WHAT IS DRIVING THIS IS A NEW  CONCERN, WHICH IS THAT THE ACTUAL DATA TABLES THEMSELVES,  BECAUSE THEY ARE SO MASSIVE AND THERE'S SO MANY OF THEM, THEY  ACTUALLY PRODUCE UNDER NEW CONDITIONS THE POSSIBILITY THAT  YOU CAN FIGURE OUT, YOU CAN RECONSTRUCT THE INDIVIDUAL  DATA. AND THAT'S TAKEN ME A WHILE TO  GET MY HEAD AROUND. SO-- BUT THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT  WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, WHICH IS WHY THE QUESTION OF THEIR  LIMITATIONS TO PROTECT THE INDIVIDUAL DATA ON THE ACTUAL  DATA TABLES, THERE ARE LIMITATIONS.  SO I WILL SAY, AND OUT OF RESPECT TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO I  DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU ARE IN UNDERSTANDING AND LISTENING AND  HEARING ABOUT THIS, THIS PROCESS, THAT THERE IS DEBATE  ABOUT THIS. THERE ARE DATA USERS,  ESPECIALLY I THINK SOME ACADEMICS, BUT THERE MAY BE  OTHERS WHO ACTUALLY THINK THAT MAYBE THE CENSUS BUREAU IS  GOING TOO FAR. AND SO I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT.  WHEN I FIRST HEARD THIS, I ACTUALLY WAS -- THAT SOUNDED  RIGHT TO ME IMMEDIATELY, BECAUSE WE'VE HAD THIS DATA,  WE'RE SO DEPENDENT ON IT, IT'S BEEN AROUND, NOTHING  HORRIBLE HAS EVER HAPPENED. I TALKED TO PEOPLE MORE SOPHISTICATED  THAN ME ABOUT THE CAPABILITIES. PART OF THIS PROBLEM IS THAT WE  NOW HAVE COMPUTATIONAL ABILITY IN TERMS OF MACHINERY AND  SOFTWARE THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO DO THINGS THAT WERE TOTALLY  INCONCEIVABLE BEFORE. AND THAT'S THE CONCERN, AS I  UNDERSTAND IT, THAT'S DRIVING THIS.  AND SINCE I BELIEVE THEM AND TRUST THEM, AS UNDERSTANDING THINGS MUCH BETTER THAN I DO,  THEY BELIEVE THAT AND ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IT, I'M NOW  SORT OF BROUGHT BACK TO THE MIDDLE WHERE I THINK THERE ARE  REAL CONCERNS AND I BELIEVE THEY ARE BEING ADDRESSED, AND  WHAT I'M VERY, VERY CONVINCED OF, FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD AND  DISCUSSIONS THAT I'VE HAD WITH PEOPLE HERE, IS THAT THEY ARE  BEING DONE AND THESE DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE WITH GREAT,  GREAT CARE. BUT THEY ARE DECISIONS.  THERE ARE CHOICES. THAT'S THE OTHER PART THAT I'M  VERY SORT OF IMPRESSED WITH AND PROUD OF IS THAT THE CENSUS  BUREAU IS INVITING THE FEEDBACK THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THESE  DECISIONS NEED TO BE MADE WITH INPUT FROM PEOPLE WHO THEY  CAN'T REPRESENT. BUT THAT I'M INFORMING US THAT  WE PARTIALLY REPRESENT AND THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHERS.  AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE HERE IS THAT  THE CENSUS BUREAU HAS BEEN GOING AROUND, AND I BELIEVE  THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE AND MORE INVITATIONS TO FEEDBACK  AND DISCUSSION, CERTAINLY IN THE RESEARCH AND ACADEMIC  COMMUNITIES, BUT I THINK MANY OF US REPRESENT SORT OF -- I  DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS -- END USERS WHO HAVE VERY SPECIFIC  NEEDS. AND SO, YOU KNOW, I THINK PART  OF OUR JOB IS TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND AND FOR US TO GET --  INFORM OURSELVES ENOUGH ABOUT WHAT YOU GUYS NEED, WHAT YOUR  ORGANIZATIONS AND PEOPLE YOU REPRESENT NEED, AND WHETHER OR  NOT IT'S THERE. AND SO THE OTHER THING IS THAT  I THINK THAT THERE ARE -- IT'S AN INTERESTING PROBLEM HERE,  WHICH IS THAT WE KIND OF HAVE TO UNDERSTAND A CERTAIN AMOUNT  OF THE TECHNICAL SIDE BUT I THINK WE ALSO HAVE TO PAY  ATTENTION TO WHAT THE SUBSTANTIVE NEEDS ARE.  AND CREATE A KIND OF BALANCE, I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO  SPEAK MOSTLY ABOUT THE SUBSTANTIVE NEEDS.  YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET AN ENUMERATION AND COUNT  OF THE COMMUNITIES AND WITH THE DETAILS THAT YOU NEED, THEN WE  GOT A PROBLEM. AND THE CENSUS BUREAU IS VERY  AWARE OF THAT. AND THERE ARE SOME MECHANISMS.  THIS IS WHERE I MUST ADMIT THERE IS SOME CONFUSION ON MY  PART, AND IT'S SORT OF THE GENERAL THING I WOULD LIKE SOME  HELP UNDERSTANDING BETTER, IS LET ME SEE, I THINK I TRIED TO PUT THIS UP SOMEWHERE.  SO, I GUESS THIS IS ONE VERSION OF THE POINT, IS THAT WE'VE  SEEN THAT THERE ARE A BUNCH OF TABLES THAT HAVE ALWAYS EXISTED  THAT EXIST AT VERY DETAILED LEVEL AND/OR MANDATED THAT WILL  BE AVAILABLE, BUT OTHER TABLES EXISTED TRADITIONALLY WHICH  WILL NO LONGER EXIST. A NUMBER HAVE TO DO WITH THINGS  WE'RE PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN.  SO, RACIAL AND ETHNIC ORIGIN GROUPS, AND TRIBAL GROUPS, AND  OTHER DETAILS ABOUT THE POPULATION, AND THEN OF  INTEREST TO ME ARE SOME OF THE ISSUES AROUND HOUSEHOLDS AND  FAMILY TYPES. IT'S THOSE THINGS AT VERY FINE  DETAIL THAT BECOME PROBLEMS BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF  CATEGORIES, AND THEY MAKE COMPLEX TABLES, ET CETERA.  SO WHAT I UNDERSTAND HERE, BUT I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT  THE MECHANISM IS, AND HOW TO THINK ABOUT THIS, SO IS THAT  THERE ARE OTHER METHODS. SO THERE'S A PRIMARY SYSTEM OF  BASICALLY GENERATING AND AGREEING TO A SET OF TABLES,  AND HAVING THE DATA THAT'S BEHIND THEM AVAILABLE FOR  PEOPLE TO WORK WITH IS I THINK HOW THAT WORKS OR AT LEAST  EXISTS, AND THEN BEING ABLE TO CREATE TABLES THAT ARE UNDER  SOME OTHER ADJACENT SYSTEM. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE  NEED TO UNDERSTAND BETTER, SO WE CAN BE MORE INFORMED.  I MEAN, I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT FOR US TO  SORT OF DEMAND OR FOR PEOPLE TO DEMAND SOMETHING THAT IS SORT  OF -- DOESN'T FIT WITHIN THE SYSTEM, BUT I BELIEVE THE  SYSTEM IS BEING DEVELOPED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THERE CAN BE A  BACK AND FORTH ABOUT THOSE THINGS.  SO THAT'S A MAJOR CONCERN THAT I'M BRINGING TO THIS.  AND THAT I WOULD LIKE SOME BETTER UNDERSTANDING.  AND THEN I THINK I BASICALLY AM SAYING THE SAME THING, SO I  GUESS THIS IS MORE LIKE I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD OR WAS JUST  UNWILLING TO DO MY DUE DILIGENCE, BUT I JUST WANT TO  GIVE YOU GUYS BACK THE REFLECTION THAT IT'S HARD TO  GET YOUR HEAD AROUND THIS, THAT THIS GETS INTO A LOT OF DETAIL,  AND WHAT I STARTED TO DO WAS LIKE TRY TO THINK ABOUT, YOU  KNOW, WHAT THINGS HAVE EXISTED, LIKE I WENT THROUGH THAT MASTER  TABLE AND STARTED LOOKING AT WHERE DID THINGS SUDDENLY JUMP  FROM THE BLOCK LEVEL, WHICH I ASSUME EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS,  EXTREME FINE GRAINED, AS GRANULAR AS YOU CAN GET, AND  YOU CAN BUILD UP ANY OTHER GEOGRAPHIC LEVEL FROM THAT,  WHERE SOME THINGS HAVE JUMPED FROM BEING BASICALLY WE USED TO  GET THEM AT THAT LEVEL, AND NOW WE'RE SUDDENLY AT THE COUNTY  LEVEL. I THINK THAT'S TRUE FOR SOME  THINGS AROUND SPECIFIC GROUPS THAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN.  THAT'S A BIG CONCERN. THE COUNTY LEVEL IS WAY TOO  HIGH, I'M SURE, FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE'S NEEDS FOR SOME OF  THOSE THINGS. ON THE OTHER HAND, I THINK  THERE'S BASICALLY SOME INDICATION THAT IN SPECIFIC  CASES THAT COULD BE MADE AVAILABLE OR WILL EXIST IN SOME  WAY OR ANOTHER. BY THE WAY, I JUST WANT TO SAY  ONE OTHER THING BECAUSE IT'S ONLY DURING THE MEETINGS THAT I  TALK WITH PEOPLE AND THOUGHT ABOUT THIS MORE THAT I BEGAN TO  REALIZE THIS. RIGHT NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT  THE DECENNIAL CENSUS. YOU KNOW, THE DECENNIAL CENSUS  IS REALLY THE MOST BASIC DATA, BUT IT'S VERY, VERY FEW  QUESTIONS. I MEAN, IT'S SEX AND AGE,  RACE/ETHNICITY, AND BASICALLY I THINK THE TYPE, YOU KNOW,  OWNER/RENTER KIND OF THING. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ONE OR  TWO OTHERS, BUT THERE ARE NOT MANY QUESTIONS.  BUT THIS PROBLEM AND THESE ISSUES ARE EVENTUALLY BUT NOT  IMMEDIATELY GOING TO BE APPLIED TO ALL CENSUS DATA, ESPECIALLY  THE MOST USED CENSUS DATA, IN MY WORLD, WHICH IS THE AMERICAN  COMMUNITY SURVEY. SO, YOU KNOW, BEGINNINGS OF  THIS DISCUSSION WE NEED TO BE HAVING, OKAY, IT'S EASY RIGHT  NOW, RELATIVELY EASY BUT YOU CAN ALSO SEE HOW COMPLICATED,  HOW MULTIPLE THE TABLES ARE AND WHERE -- FIGURING OUT WHERE WE  LOST SOMETHING OR WHERE WE NEED SOMETHING.  SO, BASICALLY I REALLY SAW MY ROLE AS TRYING TO HELP FRAME  WHAT THE PROBLEM IS HERE, BECAUSE I REALLY THINK THAT  IT'S THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND THE DIFFERENT  KINDS OF NEEDS THAT PEOPLE HAVE THAT NEED TO BE BROUGHT TO THE  TABLE SO WE CAN HAVE A PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSION.  AND I THINK IT'S VERY EXCITING BECAUSE THERE'S AN OPENNESS TO  HEARING OUR FEEDBACK. THIS IS ONE OF THE TIMES WHEN  WE'RE RELATIVELY EARLY IN A PROCESS, AND I THINK WE CAN  HAVE AN EFFECT. BUT THIS IS GOING TO BE AN  ISSUE WE'LL BE DISCUSSING FOR A WHILE.  THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT MORE DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS.  AND SO I REALLY INVITE MY COLLEAGUES ON THE NAC TO EXPAND  AND EXPRESS WHAT YOUR NEEDS AND CONCERNS ARE ABOUT THIS.  THANK YOU. ^^ GREAT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH,  STUART. JOHN ABOWD HAD A RESPONSE TO  SOMETHING STUART SAID AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO OUR QUESTIONS FROM THE NAC MEMBERS.  ^^ THANK YOU, AND THANKS FOR THOSE EXCELLENT COMMENTS. THANKS TO JASON AND CYNTHIA,  PRETTY GOOD AT THIS PRESENTATION.  I WANT TO TRY NOT TO GO TOO DEEPLY INTO THE WEEDS, BUT ALSO  GIVE YOU A SUBSTANTIVE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTIONS, THAT'S GOT  ENOUGH TECHNICAL DETAIL IN IT SO YOU CAN APPRECIATE WHAT'S  GOING ON. SO, THE CENSUS BUREAU HAS MADE  A COMMITMENT TO USE FORMAL PRIVACY METHODS FOR ALL  PUBLICATIONS FROM THE 2020 CENSUS EXCEPTION  APPORTIONMENT NUMBERS, I'VE BEEN ASKED TO SPEAK TO THAT  EVERY TIME I SPEAK SO I LEAD WITH THAT NOW.  WHAT PLATTERS HERE IS THE ALGORITHMS THAT YOU USE TO DO  THAT. THE ALGORITHMS CHAIN TOGETHER,  SEQUENCES OF PROGRAMS, EACH OF WHICH HAS TO SATISFY CERTAIN  CONSTRAINTS IN ORDER TO MEET DEFINITIONS OF FORMAL PRIVACY.  THE ALGORITHMS THAT OUR TEAM WAS INITIALLY ASKED TO DEVELOP  HAD TO PRODUCE MICRODATA SUMMARIES THAT COULD BE SENT TO  THE PREEXISTING TABULATION SYSTEM IN ORDER TO PRODUCE  DISSEMINATION QUALITY TABLES. SO THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF  INFRASTRUCTURE THERE, CYNTHIA IS EXTREMELY FAMILIAR WITH  THIS, JASON HAS BEEN ONE OF THE PERSONS AUDITING THESE THINGS  FOR A LONG TIME. THERE'S A LOT OF INFRASTRUCTURE  THERE THAT THE MAIN TOP-DOWN ALGORITHM, TDA, WAS DESIGNED TO  PLUG INTO. IT TURNED OUT AS WE DEVELOPED  THAT, THAT WE WERE ABLE TO SHOW  MATHEMATICALLY CERTAIN KINDS OF TABLES WE USED TO PRODUCE  DIDN'T FIT INTO THAT PARADIGM. THEY ARE THE ONES THAT STUART  CALLED OUT, DETAILED RACE AND ETHNICITY, TABULATIONS THAT  TELL YOU ABOUT CHARACTERISTICS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING WITH A  HOUSEHOLD OF A PARTICULAR CHARACTERISTICS, TECHNICAL TERM  IS JOINED TABLE. IT WAS NOT WITHIN THE REACH OF  THE ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY IN THE TDA TO PRODUCE MICRODATA  THAT WOULD DELIVER THOSE TABULATIONS ALONG WITH THE  ESSENTIALLY BULK OF THE OLD SF 1, NOW CALLED DHC.  SO A LONG SERIES OF EXECUTIVE-LEVEL DISCUSSIONS  ENSUED, IN WHICH WE ASKED, WHICH OF THE CONSTRAINTS CAN WE  RELAX, IF WE CAN'T RELAX THE MICRODATA CONSTRAINT, THEN A  MUCH MORE LIMITED SET OF DETAILED RACE AND ETHNICITY,  AIN AND JOINED TABLES MIGHT BE POSSIBLE WITH ENGINEERING.  IF WE CAN RELAX THAT CONSTRAINT AND DEVELOP A SEPARATE SET OF  DIFFERENTIALLY PRIVATE ALGORITHMS THAT DON'T HAVE TO  PRODUCE MICRODATA, THEN WE CAN EXPAND THE SPACE OF PRODUCTS  THAT WE CAN PRODUCE. SO WE DECIDED TO DO THE LATTER.  WE HAVE ALREADY WRITTEN SOME OF THE CONTRACTS TO IMPLEMENT  THAT. BUT NOW YOU CAN SEE WHAT THE  ISSUE IS. THERE ARE OTHER PIECES THAT ARE  MISSING AGAIN. SO OUTCOME PROTECTED TABLES BUT  THERE'S NO DISSEMINATION SYSTEM THAT INGESTS PROTECTED TABLES  AND DISTRIBUTES THEM IN A FORMAT YOU'RE LIKELY TO SEE.  SECONDLY, THOSE TABLES OF NECESSITY WON'T GO DOWN TO THE  LEVELS OF DETAILED GEOGRAPHY THAT YOU'RE USED TO SEEING.  THERE WERE 100 BILLION LINEARLY INDEPENDENT STATISTICS IN SF2  AND AI/AN. YOKE  I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO GO BACK TO HIGH SCHOOL ALGEBRA TO  UNDERSTAND THAT MAKES AN EQUATION SYSTEM THAT HAS  SOLUTIONS THAT WILL PICK OUT THE PEOPLE THAT YOU WERE  TALKING ABOUT. THAT'S JUST TRUE.  SO, WE ASKED OURSELVES WHAT CAN WE DO IN THIS SITUATION TO  IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE DATA PRODUCTS RECOGNIZING THAT THE  DISCLOSURE LIMITATION WAS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT.  THE ANSWER TO THAT IS TO USE THE STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY  THAT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST DECADE  IN PRODUCING HIGH QUALITY ESTIMATES OF DETAILED  GEOGRAPHIC AREAS USING COMBINATION OF DIRECT ESTIMATES  AND MODELING. SO THERE'S NOW A TEAM BEING  DEPLOYED TO DO THAT, AND THE GOAL OF THAT TEAM IS TO DELIVER  DATA PRODUCTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY AS GOOD IN QUALITY AS THE ONES  THAT WERE DELIVERED FROM 2010, BUT THEY ARE NOT ALL WHAT WE  CALL DIRECT ESTIMATES. THEY ARE MODELED ESTIMATES.  ALL OF THAT SAID, THIS IS A VERY EARLY STAGE OF  DEVELOPMENT, JUST AS YOU POINTED OUT, IT IS OUR  INTENTION TO ENGAGE THE USER COMMUNITY AS EXTENSIVELY AS  POSSIBLE, AND IT'S ALSO OUR INTENTION TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT  THIS ACTIVITY REALLY REQUIRES THAT THE USERS HAVE A LOOK AT  PROVISIONAL PRODUCTS, DEMONSTRATION PRODUCTS, TESTS,  AND GIVE ACTIVE COMMENTS. SO IT MIGHT TAKE A LITTLE  LONGER TO GET THOSE PRODUCTS OUT THAN WE WOULD ALL LIKE, BUT  THIS ITERATIVE PROCESS OUGHT TO DELIVER BETTER QUALITY DATA  PRODUCTS THAN WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE COME OUT.  SO WE DON'T WANT TO OVERPROMISE.  I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE  BECAUSE OUR AGREEMENT AMONGST US IS THAT WE WON'T COMMIT TO A  PRODUCT UNTIL WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN DELIVER IT AND THAT IT  HAS THE QUALITY THAT OUR USERS EXPECT.  SO I GOT A LITTLE BIT INTO THE WEEDS, BUT TORY AGREED WE  SHOULD GET THIS OUT IN THE OPEN NOW SO THAT WE CAN DISCUSS IT  ALONG WITH THE OTHER THINGS FOR THE REST OF THE MORNING.  SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PATIENCE.  ^^ CAN I ASK ONE -- ADD ONE QUESTION, WHICH I FORGOT TO  MENTION. I THINK ONE THING THAT WOULD BE  HELPFUL HERE, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN DO IT RIGHT NOW, BUT  ALSO IT WOULD BE HELP FOLLOW HAVE A LITTLE BETTER  UNDERSTANDING OF THE TIMELINE OF DECISION MAKING BECAUSE I'M  SORT OF THINKING ABOUT FOR THE NAC AND FOR OTHERS, THEY WOULD,  YOU KNOW, -- AND SOME OF IT MAY NOT BE KNOWN, SOME IS PUSHED  OUT, BUT JUST TO START TO GIVE US SOME IDEA ABOUT THAT, I  THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL. ^^ THIS IS JOHN ABOWD AGAIN.  I'M NOT GOING TO HAND THIS QUESTION OFF TO CYNTHIA BECAUSE  I THINK WHAT YOU WANT IS A DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCESS.  SO IF YOU GO TO THE PAGES THAT CYNTHIA -- AS WE MAKE  DECISIONS, WE WILL PUT THEM OUT THERE.  SO, WE HAVE COMMITTED TO THE TIMELINE FOR PL94-171 AND  DHC TABLES ON THE LIST OF PRODUCTS JASON AND CYNTHIA JUST DESCRIBED. WE'RE TRYING TO COMMIT TO THE  GENERAL TIMELINE THAT THE CENSUS BUREAU ANNOUNCED SEVERAL  YEARS AGO FOR DATA PRODUCTS, OUR ABILITY TO DO THAT WILL  DEPEND ON OTHER FACTORS, AND WE WILL CERTAINLY KEEP THE USER  COMMUNITY IN THE LOOP. ACTUALLY TRY TO PROVIDE ACTIVE  EXPLANATIONS, IF A PARTICULAR THING IS GOING TO BE DELAYED,  WE'LL GIVE THE REASONS, AND SO I THINK THAT'S ABOUT AS  TRANSPARENT AS WE CAN BE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGED, AND I WANT TO  ACKNOWLEDGE, THAT WHAT WE'RE HAVING IS A PUBLIC DISCUSSION  ABOUT FEATURES OF CENSUS DATA THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO  HAVE A PUBLIC DISCUSSION ABOUT BEFORE, AND THAT PUBLIC  DISCUSSION OUGHT TO SHAPE THE POLICIES OF THE CENSUS BUREAU  AND IT WILL. IT'S GOOD THAT WE CAN HAVE IT.  AND SO LET'S JUST KEEP THAT PART GOING.  OKAY? THANK YOU.  ^^ OKAY. SO WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO  OUR DISCUSSION HERE, FIRST PERSON I HAVE IS NICOLE.  ^^ THANKS. NICOLE BORROMEO.  I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT SLIDE 12.  20% OF ALASKA CENSUS TRACTS HAVE 2,000 RESIDENTS OR LESS,  AND WITHIN THOSE SMALL TRACTS REDECIDES 1/3 TO 1/2 OF  ALASKA'S NATIVE POPULATION. AS YOU HEARD THROUGH TRIBAL CONSULTATION, THE  AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVE COMMUNITIES ARE VERY  CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THE BUREAU'S DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY  MEASURES ARE GOING TO SKEW OUR DATA.  THIS IS IMPORTANT TO US BECAUSE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT OWES OUR  FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES SPECIAL TRUST RESPONSIBILITY,  THIS TRUST RESPONSIBILITY IS GROUNDED IN THE CONSTITUTION,  FEDERAL TRIBAL TREATIES, HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY RECONFIRMED  THROUGH DECADES AND CENTURIES REALLY OF CASE LAW AND FEDERAL  STATUTES. WITH RESPECT TO SLIDE 12,  JASON, YOU MENTIONED THE BUREAU IS IS IN THE PROCESS OF  DEVELOPING FORMALLY PRIVACY SYSTEM THAT MAINTAINS  CONFIDENTIALITY. WHEN DO YOU EXPECT TO HAVE  THOSE SYSTEMS DEVELOPED, THIS IS CONCERNING CONSIDERING THE  ENUMERATION STARTS FOR ALASKA TUKSUB BAY ON 2 21st OF JANUARY, AND WILL THEY  BETTER ENABLE TO UPHOLD TRUST RESPONSIBILITIES TO OUR TRIBES?  THANK YOU. ^^ JASON DEVINE. I'LL PROVIDE A BRIEF ANSWER,  JOHN ABOWD TOUCHED ON IT IN THE RESPONSE, CAN PROVIDE MORE  INFORMATION. I WOULD SAY AT THIS POINT AS  FAR AS WORK ON THE ALGORITHMS, THE PRODUCTS TEAM HAS STARTED  THAT WORK. I THINK THE REST -- TO PROVIDE  A MORE COMPLETE RESPONSE WOULD HAVE TO COME FROM OTHERS WHO  ARE WORKING MORE CLOSELY WITH THOSE TEAMS, I DON'T KNOW,  JOHN, IF YOU WANT TO PROVIDE MORE. ^^ HI.  THIS IS JOHN ABOWD AGAIN. SO, WE HAVE WRITTEN A TASK  ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THE PRODUCTION OF DETAILED RACE AND  ETHNICITY, AI/AN, HOUSEHOLD PERSON JOINED TABLES.  IT HAS AGGRESSIVE TIME LINE FOR THE FIRST YEAR, SUCH THAT  DEMONSTRATION PRODUCTS WOULD BE AVAILABLE INTERNAL TO THE  CENSUS BUREAU, NOT NECESSARILY PUBLIC, AT THE END OF EIGHT  MONTHS. SO IT'S ABOUT AS AGGRESSIVE AS  YOU CAN PUT A SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM ON.  THE FIRST ONES OF THOSE PRODUCTS WILL BE TO ADDRESS  DETAILED RACE AND ETHNICITY AND AI/AN.  THE FIRST TOOL TO BE DELIVERED WILL ALLOW OUR INTERNAL SUBJECT  MATTER EXPERTS TO START MUCH MORE PRECISELY ASKING --  ANSWERING QUESTIONS YOU JUST RAISED.  HOW DO WE GENERATE ACCURATE DETAILED COUNTS AND STILL  PROVIDE KINDS OF DEMOGRAPHIC DATA THAT YOU WANT IN ADDITION  TO THE COUNT. SO I THINK TO BE FAIR, THE  PROBLEM IS WELL STATED. THE CONTRACTOR TEAM IS NOT  STARTING FROM SCRATCH. THE INTERNAL SCIENCE HAD  ALREADY BEEN PARTIALLY DEVELOPED, SO THEY ARE STARTING  WITH A SET OF PROPOSALS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE FEASIBLE.  WE DON'T KNOW THEM TO BE FEASIBLE, SO THAT'S WHY I DON'T WANT TO OVERPROMISE.  IT'S AN AGGRESSIVE TIME LINE. CERTAINLY BY THE NEXT TIME WE  MEET, WE WILL BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU PROGRESS REPORT ON THAT.  AND I HOPE YOU'LL FIND THAT PROGRESS  REPORT UPLIFTING. YOU GOT TO BE AN OPTIMIST IN  THIS BUSINESS. YOU KNOW, OPTIMISM CAN ONLY  CARRY YOU SO FAR. YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY DELIVER.  SO UNDERSTANDING THAT I HAVEN'T MADE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES  HERE, BUT I HAVE TOLD YOU WHAT THE MECHANISM IS BY WHICH WE  WOULD DELIVER THOSE THINGS. WE HAVE A COMMITMENT TO DELIVER  USABLE, DETAILED RACE AND ETHNICITY DATA AND USABLE AI/AN  DATA AND WILL MEET THAT COMMITMENT, WE BELIEVE WE KNOW  HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT, BUT TO SAY ANY MORE WOULD BE MORE  SPECULATION THAN SCIENCE AT THIS POINT, OKAY?  THANKS. ^^ ONE FOLLOW-UP COMMENT, JOHN. THANK YOU, JOHN. NICOLE AGAIN FROM AMERICAN  FEDERATION OF ALASKA NATIVES. IT WILL BE THE FEDERATION  RECOMMENDATION, I'LL SEEK SUPPORT FROM COLLEAGUES ON THE  NAC, TO THE EXTENT YOU FIND IT IS UNFEASIBLE FOR YOU TO DEVELOP THAT ADDITIONAL TOOL THAT YOU'RE GOING TO USE, THAT YOU DON'T APPLY DIFFERENTIAL  PRIVACY TO OUR TABLES THIS TIME AROUND BECAUSE WE DO HAVE THAT  SPECIAL TRUST RESPONSIBILITY THAT MAKES OUR COMMUNITY A BIT  DIFFERENT, AND THE STAKES ARE VERY TIE HIGH IN TERMS OF GET  -- VERY HIGH IN TERMS OF GETTING DATA CORRECT. ^^ I  DON'T MAKE ANY OF THOSE DECISIONS.  THE DECISIONS ABOUT HOW TO DO CONFIDENTIALITY PROTECTION FOR  2020 CENSUS IS MADE BY DATA STEWARDSHIP EXECUTIVE POLICY  COMMITTEE. I SIT ON THAT COMMITTEE, SO  DOES THE FRONT ROW HERE, INCLUDING WRAPPING AROUND TO  WHERE THE MEMBERS START. AND WE'VE HAD A LOT OF VERY  LONG, VERY SERIOUS CONVERSATIONS, AND WE WELCOME  THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM INTEREST GROUPS LIKE YOURS, AND  THEY WILL GET FULL CONSIDERATION.  THANK YOU. ^^ SORT OF ADDING TO NICOLE'S  COMMENT, I KNOW SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE ASKED  TO REITERATE, JOHN, EVERY TIME YOU SPEAK ABOUT THIS, THAT THE  100% COUNTS ARE GOING TO BE USED FOR CONGRESSIONAL  REPRESENTATION, AND THESE KINDS OF THINGS, RIGHT?  SO I THINK PART OF MAYBE WHAT NICOLE IS ASKING IS THAT IS IT  POSSIBLE THAT THERE BE 100% COUNTS, NOT BY TABLES OR THAT  STUFF BUT 100% COUNTS USED FOR FUNDING-RELATED ISSUES FOR  AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVES, I DON'T KNOW IF I  HEARD QUITE A RESPONSE. THIS MAY NOT BE YOUR DECISION  BUT MAYBE THAT WOULD BE A RECOMMENDATION THE NAC COULD  MAKE FOR THE PURPOSES OF ALLOCATION FUNDING FOR AMERICAN  INDIAN TRIBES, THERE ARE 100% COUNTS USED EVEN IF NOT  PUBLICLY RELEASED BECAUSE OF DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY, COUNTS BE  USED THE SAME WAY 100% COUNTS USED FOR CONGRESSIONAL  REPRESENTATION, DOES THAT -- I HOPE YOU'RE FOLLOWING WHAT I'M.  ^^ THAT'S EXACTLY MY SECOND YES, JUST BETTER STATED, YES.  ^^ JOHN ABOWD AGAIN. THAT QUESTION WILL COME BEFORE  THE DATA STEWARDSHIP EXECUTIVE POLICY COMMITTEE.  SO THE REST OF MY COMMENT IS ON THE ORDER OF TRYING TO EXPLAIN  TO YOU WHY IT'S NOT JUST A RUBBER STAMP.  EVERY DECISION THAT YOU MAKE LIKE THAT COMPROMISES THE  CONFIDENTIALITY PROTECTIONS IN THE REST OF THE DATA.  AND IT DOES SO IN WAYS THAT ARE POTENTIALLY UNLIMITED.  AND SO A BETTER SOLUTION, IN MY OPINION, MY OPINION NOW, IS TO  DEMONSTRATE THAT THE DATA THAT WE RELEASE MEETS THE ALLOCATIVE  STANDARDS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED FOR THE USES OF CENSUS  DATA IN DIRECT ALLOCATION. SO THE CONSTITUTION SAYS THAT  THE APPORTIONMENT OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES MUST BE  BASED ON ACTUAL ENUMERATION. AND THAT HAS BEEN INTERPRETED  BY THE DATA STEWARDSHIP EXECUTIVE POLICY COMMITTEE TO  MEAN THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE GIVE TO THE SECRETARY  OF COMMERCE, HE THEN DELIVERS TO THE PRESIDENT, ARE BASED ON  THE ACTUAL ENUMERATION FOR APPORTIONMENT.  SO THAT'S WHAT WE'LL DO. THE STATUTES RECOGNIZE THAT THE  CENSUS DATA ARE GOING TO BE USED FOR MANY PURPOSES  INCLUDING REDISTRICTING AND BASIS FOR ALLOCATION FORMULAS,  BASIS FOR WEIGHTS AND SURVEYS USED FOR ALLOCATION FORMULAS,  AND WE RECOGNIZE THOSE ARE IMPORTANT USE CASES.  THAT SAME STATUTE SAYS THAT WE HAVE TO PROTECT THE  CONFIDENTIALITY OF UNDERMIKE UNDERLYING MICRO DATA, REAL  REPRESENTATION RISKS EVERY TIME WE RELEASE EXACT NUMBERS  BALANCED AGAINST DISRUPTION IN THE ALLOCATION FORMULAS, AND WE ARE TRYING TO BE TRANSPARENT AND TRYING TO PROMOTE  DISCUSSIONS WITH ALL INTEREST GROUPS ABOUT THOSE TRADEOFFS.  BUT THEY ARE REAL TRADEOFFS AND DON'T GO AWAY BY SAYING THIS  INTEREST GROUP HAS PARTICULAR STATUTORY AUTHORITY, MANY  INTEREST GROUPS HAVE STATUTORY AUTHORITY, AND I RECOGNIZE THE  SPECIAL STATUS THAT AMERICAN INDIANS AND ALASKA NATIVES  HAVE, BUT THOSE ARE INTRAGOVERNMENTAL TREATIES BUT  THE TREATIES DO NOT ESCAPE PROTECTION OF SECTION 9 OF  TITLE 13 SO WE'RE TRYING TO BE GOOD STEWARDS OF THE DATA AND  TRYING HAVE THIS DISCUSSION IN A PUBLIC WAY SO THAT IT'S  UNDERSTOOD WHY THE DECISIONS ARE MADE, AND I'LL STRESS AGAIN  THAT THOSE DECISIONS HAVE NOT BEEN MADE FOR THE 2020 CENSUS  AND WHEN THEY ARE MADE THEY WILL BE MADE AS MATTER OF  POLICY, NOT ALGORITHMS.  THANK YOU. ^^ TAEKU IS NEXT.  ^^ THANK YOU. TAEKU LEE.  I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS THAT PICK UP ON SOME SAME THEMES BUT  OFF OF SLIDE 27, AND LIKE STUART AND NOT AN EXTREMELY  HIGH END USER OF CENSUS DATA BUT FREQUENT USER.  THE FIRST IS ON THE PLAN FOR TABLES FOR DETAILED RACE AND  HISPANIC ORIGIN GROUPS AND AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA  NATIVE GROUPS, I APPRECIATE CAREFUL EXPLANATION BUT FROM  END USER, IS CONTINUED RESEARCH PLANNED ABOUT WHETHER THESE  SUBGROUP TABLES WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE OR WHICH ONES WILL BE  MADE AVAILABLE FOR WHAT WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE IN THE TABLES,  WASN'T CLEAR FROM YOUR ANSWER TO STUART WHETHER, FOR EXAMPLE,  THIS IS A SOFTWARE PROBLEM OR A PRIVACY PROBLEM.  AND ALSO WHEN YOU MENTIONED ALGORITHMS THAT PRODUCE  MICRODATA CAN YOU CLARIFY FOR SOMEBODY AT MY LEVEL WHAT THAT ACTUALLY MEANS, AND THEN DO THE CONFIDENTIALITY ISSUES MEAN POTENTIAL OUTCOME  IS LARGER SUBGROUPS LIKE CHINESE AMERICANS OR CUBAN  AMERICANS WOULD GET A TABLE BUT SMALLER SUBGROUPS LIKE TOMURO  OR CAMBODIAN OR COSTA RICANS DO  NOT GET TABLES. SIMILAR LAY SEVERAL LINES  BELOW, THE SLIDE SAYS WE CONTINUE TO DISCUSS RELEASE OF  PUMS FILE FOR 2020 CENSUS, AGAIN IS THE DISCUSSION ABOUT  IF OR HOW AND WHAT? SO THAT IS WHICH VARIABLES OR  HOW LARGE OF A MICROSAMPLE OR IS IT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT  THERE WILL BE A RELEASE OF ANY KIND OF PUBLIC USE MICROSAMPLE  FILE, AND IF IT'S ABOUT "IF," WHAT ARE THE MAIN CONCERNS  BEYOND CONFIDENTIALITY AND REIDENTIFICATION RISK THAT ARE  FEEDING INTO THE DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER THERE WILL BE A  PUMS FILES FROM 2020.  THANK YOU. ^^ I'M SURE -- JOHN ABOWD.  SOME OF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS FOR CYNTHIA AND JASON WHO ARE  EXTREMELY WELL PREPARED TO ANSWER THEM.  BUT I'LL TAKE THESE. SO LET'S START WITH THE  REQUIREMENT TO PRODUCE MICRODATA.  SO, IF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE SYSTEMS THE CENSUS BUREAU  HAS DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES, FOR  DISSEMINATING INFORMATION, THEN YOU'LL KNOW THAT WHEN YOU GO  INTO THE AMERICAN FACTFINDER AND YOU POSE YOUR QUESTION, YOU  GET DIRECTED TO A TABLE WITH A PARTICULAR LAYOUT THAT  GENERALLY CONTAINS THE DATA THAT YOU WERE LOOKING FOR.  THAT WHOLE -- THAT'S NOW BEEN MIGRATED AND REPLACED BY DATA. CENSUS.GOV THAT OPERATES ON THE SAME PRINCIPLES.  IN ORDER TO LOAD THAT TABLE INTO THE DISSEMINATION SYSTEM,  IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO JUST ASK A STATISTICAL PROGRAM TO  CALCULATE THOSE NUMBERS. THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE ROWS,  DESCRIPTIONS OF THE COLUMNS, THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE  STATISTICS AND ANNOTATIONS REQUIRED FOR THOSE STATISTICS  ALL HAVE TO BE DELIVERED IN THE FORM OF META DATA.  THAT'S DONE BY A TABULATION SYSTEM.  OUR TABULATION SYSTEMS HISTORICALLY HAVE OPERATED ON  THE ACTUAL MICRODATA FROM THE SURVEY, THAT HAS BEEN PASSED  THROUGH A TRADITIONAL CONFIDENTIALITY PROTECTION  SYSTEM, GENERAL RELATIONSHIP TO HOUSEHOLDER FOR HOUSEHOLD DATA  THAT INVOLVES SWAPPING AND SOME MODELING OF THE VARIABLES AND RECORDS.  RECORD STRUCTURE LOOKS LIKE DATA AND CAN TABULATE.  WE WERE CONSTRAINED THE MAIN MODULES TO GIVE TABULATION  SYSTEM SOMETHING IT COULD DO THAT WITH SO IT COULD MAKE THE TABLES THAT WERE FORMATTED BY SPECIFICATIONS THAT PEOPLE LIKE JASON AND  CYNTHIA SUPPLY, SO THAT THEY CAN THEN GO INTO A  DISSEMINATION SYSTEM. THAT MEANS THAT THE DISCLOSURE  AVOIDANCE SYSTEM DOESN'T PRODUCE THE TABLES THAT ARE  ACTUALLY RELEASED. THEY ARE PRODUCED FROM  MICRODATA. MICRODATA IS DEFINED AS RECORD  LEVEL IMAGE OF THE UNDERLYING DATA SO MICRODATA WE DELIVER TO  THAT TABULATION SYSTEM PRODUCES NOT THE ORIGINAL CONFIDENTIAL  DATA BUT THE PROTECTED TABULAR SUMMARIES THAT HAVE GONE.  THAT'S JUST TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF HOW IT WORKS.  THOSE MICRODATA HAVE ALREADY BEEN THROUGH DISCLOSURE  AVOIDANCE SO THEY ARE CANDIDATES FOR PUBLIC USE  MICROSAMPLE FILE, AND THE REASON THAT THE PUBLIC USE  MICRODATA SAMPLE FILE IS AT THE END OF PRODUCT LIST IS IT'S NOW  A SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PROBLEM, HOW BEST TO GET NOT JUST THE  ONES THAT WENT INTO DHC AND PL-94 BUT INTO THE DETAILED  RACE AND ETHNICITY PROPERLY REPRESENTED IN MICRODATA FILES  GIVEN THE OTHER SYSTEMS ARE NOT GOING TO PRODUCE MICRODATA.  SO THAT IS A COMPLICATED SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND  SCIENTIFIC PROBLEM THAT WE HAVEN'T SOLVED.  THAT'S WHY WE HAVEN'T SAID WHAT THE SPECIFICATION WILL BE.  BUT THE MICRODATA PRODUCTS THAT WE'VE RELEASED HISTORICALLY  HAVE BEEN THROUGH DISCLOSURE AVOIDANCE, NOT AN EXACT IMAGE  OF UNDERLYING CONFIDENTIAL DATA  EITHER. IF I DIDN'T HIT ALL YOUR  QUESTIONS, REMIND ME WHAT I MISSED, I'LL TRY AGAIN.  ^^ ONE QUESTION FOR THE DETAILED RACE AND HISPANIC  ORIGIN GROUPS AND AI/AN IS WHETHER THE SIZE OF THE GROUPS  AND GENERAL POPULATION WILL AFFECT LIKELIHOOD OF BEING --  THERE BEING TABLES AT LEAST.  ^^ SO THIS IS JOHN ABOWD AGAIN.  THAT'S THE CONSTRAINT WE'RE TRYING TO GET RID OF, TRYING  NOT TO SUPPRESS DATA BUT TO HAVE THE USERS RECOGNIZE THE  SMALLER THE TARGET POPULATION, THE NOISIER THE TABULAR SUMMARY  WILL BE. SO THAT'S A STATEMENT OF A  FEATURE, NOT A BUG, IN THE ALGORITHMS. RECOGNIZING GOOD STATISTICAL  METHODS HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED BY GEOSPATIAL  SCIENTISTS TO USE THESE ROUTINELY TO GIVE YOU VERY  DETAILED THERMAL MAPS OF CHARACTER CHARACTERISTICS  WHERE THEY HAVE ONLY TAKEN MEASUREMENTS AND MODELED THE  REST. WE BELIEVE THAT KIND OF  MODELING STRATEGY WILL ACTUALLY DELIVER VERY USABLE DETAILED  GEOGRAPHIC DATA ON THESE SMALL POPULATIONS, UNDERSTANDING THAT  IT INVOLVES COMBINING INFORMATION FROM A VARIETY OF  TABLES IN A FAIRLY SOPHISTICATED WAY, BUT A WAY  THAT IS EXPLAINABLE AND COMES WITH PROPERLY DEFINED MEASURES  OF UNCERTAINTY SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHEN THE INFERENCES ARE VALID AND  WHEN THEY ARE NOT. THE LEVEL OF GEOGRAPHIC DETAIL  IS NOT THE SAME THING AS WHAT TABLES YOU PRODUCE WITH THE  DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY SYSTEM WITH THIS SPECIFICATION VERSUS  THAT SPECIFICATION, LEVEL OF GEOGRAPHIC DETAIL IS WHAT THE  MODELED OUTPUT PRODUCES, THAT'S HOW WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS A ING TOWARDS A ING TOWARDS A BETTER SOLUTION FOR THAT.  ^^ JAKE WAS NEXT. ^^ THANK YOU.  JAKE WITH NATIVE HAWAIIANER.  THE GROUP WAS MOST LIKELY TO SELF REPORT, MULTIPLE RACES, I  MEAN ALMOST 60% OF THOSE THAT ARE IDENTIFIED AS NATIVE  HAWAIIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER WERE IN THAT COMBINATION  CATEGORY. OUR ORGANIZATIONS WHILE WE LIKE  TO SEE NATIVE HA WE HA HAWAIIAN DATA ALONE BUT WHEN WE SEE ALONE OR COMBINATION WE SMILE.  I'M GRATEFUL THAT IN THE DHC PRODUCTS I SEE HERE ON THE  SPREADSHEET THAT THERE ARE SOME NATIVE HAWAIIAN AND PACIFIC  ISLANDER PRODUCTS THAT ARE PROPOSED TO BE AVAILABLE IN 2020, NOT AVAILABLE IN 2010, LISTED AS  NATIVE HAWAIIAN AND PACIFIC. THESE PRODUCTS BY TENURE BY  HOUSEHOLD SIZE, BY RELATIONSHIP, ARE JUST A COUPLE  ONES I'VE SEEN HERE PROPOSED FOR 2020 THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE IN  2010. REEMPHASIS THESE PRODUCTS  INCLUDE TABULATION BY ALONE OR IN COMBINATION AND NOT JUST THE  NHPI ALONE AS CURRENTLY LISTED IN DHC CROSSWALK.   MEGHAN WAS NEXT. ^^ THANK YOU.  GOOD MORNING.  I HAVE THREE SEPARATE QUESTIONS.  ONE IS ON THE TIMELINE, DECISION-MAKING STRUCTURE YOU  TALKED ABOUT, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING US THROUGH THE  PROCESS. AS A PERSON WHO COMES AT THIS  FROM AN ADVOCATE STANDPOINT AND NOT RESEARCHER STANDPOINT, I  CARE LESS ABOUT THE PROCESS AND MORE ABOUT WHERE THE END POINT  IS FOR OY OUR ABILITY TO HAVE INPUT.  SUPER PSYCHED YOU HAVE ONE DATA PRODUCT ON THE TIMELINE THAT  GETS IT OUT IN EIGHT MONTHS. MY QUESTION IS WHERE IN THAT  TIME LINE PRIOR TO THAT EIGHT-MONTH POINT IS THE END  POINT OF WHEN ADVOCATES CAN WEIGH IN ON THAT SYSTEM?  AND ALSO IF YOU COULD RESTATE WHAT THAT DECISION-MAKING  COMMITTEE IS AND WHO MAKES UP THAT DECISION-MAKING COMMITTEE  SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A SENSE OF WHEN THERE'S VALUE FOR US TO BE  SPEAKING. SO THAT WE KNOW WHO WE'RE  TALKING TO. THAT'S ONE QUESTION.  THE SECOND IS AROUND -- AND THIS IS A DATA PRODUCTS  QUESTION, BUT IT WASN'T DIRECTLY ADDRESSED BY THE  PRESENTATION, BUT I THINK ALL OF US ARE SITTING WITH THESE  OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS AROUND WHAT DATA SOURCES THE BUREAU IS  PLANNING TO USE TO COMPLY WITH EXECUTIVE ORDER ON CITIZENSHIP  DATA, IN SEVEN CENSUS OPERATIONS FOR COUNT IMPUTATION  FOR ADMINISTRATIVE RECORDS. I THINK THERE HASN'T BEEN  ANOTHER GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO TALK ABOUT THAT SO IF  THERE'S SPACE IN THIS MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT THOSE DATA PRODUCTS  THAT WOULD BE SUPER VALUABLE. AND FOR CITIZENSHIP DATA IN  PARTICULAR, WHAT DATE RANGE OF ADMINISTRATIVE RECORDS ARE YOU  USING FOR YOUR MODELING? ARE YOU USING DATA SOURCES THAT  ARE LIKE POINT IN TIME DATA SOURCES?  ARE YOU AGGREGATING DATA SOURCES OVER THE PERIOD OF A  YEAR TO GET TO THAT CITIZENSHIP DATA?  HOW ARE YOU GETTING THERE? AND THEN THE THIRD PIECE IS  MORE BUILDING OFF SOMETHING THAT STUART MENTIONED ABOUT THE  HOUSEHOLD TYPE, FAMILY TYPE TABLES, THIS MIGHT BE FOR  Y'ALL. YAY THAT THE CENSUS BUREAU IS  ASKING ABOUT SAME-SEX COUPLES BOTH MARRIED AND UNMARRIED,  THAT'S SUCH A VALUABLE DATA FOR US.  I SAW THAT THERE ARE PULLOUTS ON THAT INFORMATION IN A COUPLE  TABLES. THEN THERE'S A BUNCH OF TABLES  I'M SURPRISED IT'S NOT IN. SO FOR EXAMPLE IN A BUNCH OF  FAMILY TYPE AND HOUSEHOLD TYPE TABLES IT SAYS -- IT WILL SAY  LIKE FAMILY TYPE, THEN IT WILL SAY MARRIED COUPLE, THEN IT  WILL SAY SINGLE PARENT NO SPOUSE PRESENT, BUT THERE'S NO  INFORMATION ABOUT UNMARRIED COUPLES STRAIGHT OR SAME-SEX,  I'M JUST SURPRISED THAT THAT DATA IS LACKING IN THOSE  TABLES, AND I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD PROVIDE CLARITY ON  WHY YOU WOULDN'T GIVE THAT INFORMATION IN THOSE TABLES  AROUND FAMILY TYPE AND HOUSEHOLD TYPE.  I THINK THAT'S ALL MY QUESTIONS.  I KNOW THAT WAS A LOT.  SORRY. ^^ THIS IS JOHN ABOWD AGAIN.  I'M GOING TO LET CYNTHIA AND JASON TAKE YOUR THIRD QUESTION.  LET ME BE CLEAR. THE PRODUCTS THAT YOU SAW TO  DATE CALLED PL 94-171, DEMOGRAPHIC AND HOUSING  CHARACTERISTICS, THE TIMELINE FOR INPUT FROM NAC CSAC AND  GENERAL USER COMMUNITY IS VERY SHORT. SO PAY ATTENTION TO THE CNSTAT  WORKSHOP FOLLOWED BY REPORTS WE CONTRACTED WITH CNSTAT TO  PRODUCE AND WE'RE WAITING FOR A REPORT FROM JASON WHICH WE  CONTRACTED FOR, WE INTEND TO LOCK THOSE PRODUCTS ESSENTIALLY  IN THE PRODUCTION CYCLE THAT CYNTHIA WILL REMEMBER THE  DATES, BUT I ONLY HAVE THE SALIENT PRE-DATE SLOTS, SHE  WILL GIVE YOU THOSE IN A SECOND.  WE INTEND TO LOCK THAT CODE, AND DO THAT, SO NOW IS THE TIME  FOR THAT INPUT. WITH RESPECT TO THE DETAILED  RACE AND ETHNICITY, AI/AN, JOIN AND  OTHER PRODUCTS, WE'LL ANNOUNCE WHEN WE HAVE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS AND WE WILL BEGIN SOLICITING FEEDBACK.  IT WILL BE SHORT BY CONTRAST HAVING A WHOLE DECADE TO DO IT,  BUT WE WON'T SHORT-CHANGE USER COMMUNITY BY SAYING YOU GOT TWO  WEEKS TO FIGURE THIS OUT. IT TOOK US LONGER THAN TWO  WEEKS TO FIGURE IT OUT. WE WILL GIVE A DECENT TIMELINE,  AS TO EXACTLY WHAT THAT WILL BE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE DATA  STEWARDSHIP EXECUTIVE POLICY COMMITTEE, DSEP, SETS THESE.  AND THE MEMOS THAT CYNTHIA REFERENCED ARE MEMOS  THAT ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR, AL FONTENOT, WRITES TO THE FILE  ACKNOWLEDGING INSTRUCTIONS THAT DSEP HAS GIVEN 2020 CENSUS FOR  CONFIDENTIAL PROTECTION AND ASSETS FOR DATA STEWARDSHIP  POLICY. I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU A  TIMELINE ON THE PRODUCTS OR JOIN PRODUCTS, JUST TO SAY  TIMELINE ON DHC PRODUCTS, THAT'S RIGHT NOW.  SO I HOPE THAT'S CLEAR ENOUGH. I'M ALSO NOT GOING TO SAY  ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THE DATA PRODUCTS RELATED TO THE  CITIZENSHIP TABLE THAN THE DIRECTOR SAID YESTERDAY.  THE EXECUTIVE ORDER INSTRUCTED CENSUS BUREAU TO FORM  INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP, INSTRUCTED THE CENSUS BUREAU TO  ENHANCE ITS COLLECTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE DATA, RELATED TO  CITIZENSHIP, AND TO PRODUCE CVAP TABLE ON THE TIMELINE BY  APRIL 1 OF 2021. SO WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF  DOING. THAT'S ALL WE'RE SAYING ABOUT  IT PUBLICLY AT THE MOMENT. ^^ GREAT.  THANK YOU. OUR NEXT PERSON IS CAROL. ^^  CAN THEY ANSWER MY OTHER QUESTION TOO?  ^^ LET'S TRY TO MAKE THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS GO BY A  LITTLE FASTER BECAUSE WE'RE ALREADY -- AS ALWAYS, WE'RE  ALREADY 10 MINUTES BEHIND. THAT'S WHY I'M JUMPING IN.  GO AHEAD. ^^ I CAN PROVIDE A BRIEF RESPONSE, JASON DEVINE.  MAYBE IF WE'RE SHORT ON TIME DURING A BREAK WE CAN TALK TO A  SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT. A LOT OF CONSIDERATION WENT  INTO HOW TO FORMULATE THE TABLES WITH THE NEW CONTENT  TABLE FOR 2020. I'M GLAD YOU MENTIONED AND WERE  ABLE TO GET INTO THE CROSS WALK AND LOOK AND SEE SOME DETAILS  BECAUSE A POINT SOMETHING WE DIDN'T MENTION IN THE  PRESENTATION, CROSSWALK IS SET UP TO REFLECT TABLES AS THEY  WILL BE IN 2020 SO WE WANT TO PROVIDE A LINK TO 2010 SF1 AND  DHC, WE PROVIDE DETAILS OF THOSE TABLES THE DETAILS IS SET  UP TO REPRESENT HOW IT WOULD BE WITH THE NEW CONTENT NAMELY NEW  OPTIONS FOR THE RELATIONSHIP QUESTION, SO YOU CAN LOOK IN  THE CROSSWALK FILE AND SEE HOW THOSE TABLES HAVE BEEN SET UP.  AS YOU'VE SAID, YOU'VE NOTICED QUESTIONS HOW WE DESIGN THOSE  SO I THINK WE COULD PROBABLY TALK TO ONE OF THE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS IN A BREAK AND IT'S LOGIC SETTING UP THE DESIGN OF THOSE TABLES.  ^^ GREAT, CHARLES? ^^ AS I UNDERSTAND DIFFERENTIAL  PRIVACY, THE GOAL IS TO NOT HAVE INFORMATION AVAILABLE OR  MADE AVAILABLE OR CAN BE CONSTRUCTED THAT WOULD PROVIDE  INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION ABOUT PEOPLE THAT COULD BE THEN  CONVEYED, AND FROM MY OWN PERSPECTIVE THERE'S A LOT OF  INFORMATION ABOUT ME AND PROBABLY THE LEAST INTERESTING  AND SENSITIVE INFORMATION AND CERTAINLY THE LEAST INTERESTING AND SUSCEPTIBLE  INFORMATION AVAILABLE THROUGH THE CENSUS IS INFORMATION ON  THE CENSUS SO I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO KNOW JUST -- I THINK  STUART ASKED, WHERE ARE THE HARMS THAT CAN COME FROM THE  KIND OF SPECIFIC RELEASE AND GETTING DOWN TO THAT LEVEL OF  IDENTIFICATION AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL THAT WE REALLY ARE PROTECTING AGAINST TO BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN THAT AND WHY IT IS -- COULD BE SENSITIVE IS NOT OTHERWISE AVAILABLE.  I THINK THAT WOULD BE USEFUL ON THE 2020 CENSUS, BUT MY -- SO,  YOU KNOW, I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT, LIKE KIND OF KNOW WHAT ARE  THESE WORST CASE SCENARIOS SO WE HAVE A BETTER HANDLE ON  BEING ABLE TO EXPLAIN DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY ISSUES AND  CONCERNS TO OTHERS. BUT SECONDARILY, WHAT STUART  BROUGHT UP, MY REAL INTEREST, THERE IS MORE SENSITIVE  INFORMATION ON THE ACS. AND CERTAINLY THE PRINCIPLES OF  DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY NEED TO HOLD FOR THE ACS BUT THE ACS IS  NOT A UNIVERSAL GATHERING OF INFORMATION FROM ALL PEOPLE.  IT'S A GATHERING OF INFORMATION ON A SAMPLING BASIS, AT LEAST I  WOULD THINK THERE WOULD NOT BE THE ISSUE OF BEING ABLE TO GO  BACK AND DEIDENTIFY THE INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE YOU REALLY  DON'T KNOW WHAT INDIVIDUALS CONTRIBUTED TO THAT.  SO I REALLY DID WANT TO KIND OF PRESS ON, WILL WE BE COMING UP  WITH THE SAME ISSUES WHEN WE START LOOKING AT THE ACS AROUND  DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY, AND DO WE NEED TO PREPARE FOR THAT AND  THINK ABOUT THAT, OR NOT.  ^^ I'LL TAKE THIS, RON JARMIN, CENSUS BUREAU.  WE HAVEN'T DONE ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE  DEGREE OF RISK. YOU'RE RIGHT THERE IS A SAMPLE  THAT GIVES YOU SOME PROTECTION BUT THERE'S MORE DATA ITEMS ON  IT THAT GIVES YOU LESS PROTECTION.  SO HOW THOSE TWO TRADE OFF IS AN ANALYSIS WE NEED TO DO.  IN TERMS OF HARMS THAT WOULD COME FROM DECENNIAL CENSUS, YOU  KNOW, I THINK YOU COULD HAVE A REASONABLE ARGUMENT THAT THE  INFORMATION ON THE DECENNIAL CENSUS IS NOT THAT -- IF THAT  WAS RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC MIGHT NOT BE THAT HARMFUL.  A LOT OF IT IS PROBABLY KNOWN TO MANY PEOPLE ANYWAY, BUT  WE'RE FOLLOWING A LAW. AND A PLEDGE TO OUR RESPONDENTS  THAT WE HOLD THESE DATA TO BE CONFIDENTIAL.  SO, A BROADER PUBLIC DISCUSSION, NOT NECESSARILY LED  BY THE CENSUS BUREAU, BUT OUT IN THE PUBLIC ABOUT PRIVACY IN  GENERAL IS PROBABLY A HEALTHY THING FOR OUR SOCIETY TO BE  HAVING RIGHT NOW BUT THAT'S -- YOU KNOW, RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TO  FOLLOW, YOU KNOW, BOTH THE LAW AND PLEDGE WE GIVE TO OUR  RESPONDENTS. ^^ GREAT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  ANDREA? ^^ HI, THANK YOU.  GOOD MORNING. I WAS HOPING TO JUST GET A  CONFIRMATION ON SOMETHING I THOUGHT I HEARD, AND NOT SURE I  HEARD IT CORRECTLY. A QUICK QUESTION ABOUT THAT. I THOUGHT I HEARD THAT  ADMINISTRATIVE DATA TO BE USED FOR COUNT IMPUTATION WAS GOING  TO BE BASED OFF OF THE MODELING METHODOLOGY THAT WAS DESCRIBED.  I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S RIGHT OR IF IT WOULD BE -- IN OTHER  WORDS CLARIFICATION ON HOW ADMINISTRATIVE DATA WOULD BE  USED IN COUNT IMPUTATION WOULD BE HELPFUL, I'M NOT QUITE SURE  I UNDERSTOOD, AND THEN SECONDARY TO THAT IS WHEN  LOOKING AT THE ADMINISTRATIVE DATA, HOW IS THE DATA ITSELF  GOING TO BE -- WHAT IS CRITERIA AND HOW IS THE CENSUS BUREAU  GOING TO ASSESS QUALITY OF THOSE DIFFERENT DATA SETS.  FOR THE PURPOSES WHICH YOU'RE TRYING TO USE THEM, I SHOULD HAVE CLARIFIED.  ^^ THIS IS JOHN ABOWD. AL, DO YOU WANT SOME FROM DSSD  TO TAKE THE QUESTION ABOUT ADMINISTRATIVE DATA USES IN THE  2020 CENSUS PROCESSING? OR DO YOU WANT ME TO GIVE IT?  I DON'T SEE TOM. SO, WE HAVE DOCUMENTED  THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE DECADE THE WAY IN WHICH  ADMINISTRATIVE DATA ARE GOING TO BE USED IN THE REGULAR  PROCESSING OF THE 2020 CENSUS DATA.  THEY ARE BEING USED TO HELP WITH THE RESOLUTION OF MAF IDS,  ADDRESSES THAT CANNOT BE RESOLVED IN THE NRFU PROCESS.  I DON'T WANT TO GO INTO DETAILS BUT LET'S LEAVE IT AT THAT.  THEN THEY ARE BEING USED TO ACTUALLY ENUMERATE SOME  ADDRESSES BELIEVED -- EITHER KNOWN OR BELIEVED TO BE  OCCUPIED AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE MODELING, AS A PART OF THE  NONRESPONSE FOLLOW-UP WORK LOAD RESOLUTION.  SO, THOSE ARE ALL PRETTY WELL DOCUMENTED, I'D SAY VERY WELL  DOCUMENTED TO BE FRANK. OTHER PUBLIC DOCUMENTS WITH  WELL DESCRIBED IN CENSUS PLANS, DETAILED PLANS FOR NRFU.  UNLESS YOU HAVE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT I WILL  LEAVE THAT. OTHER USES OF ADMINISTRATIVE,  IN PARTICULAR PRODUCTION OF CITIZEN VOTING AGE POPULATION  TABLE I ANSWERED THAT QUESTION EARLIER, WE'RE ALREADY GIVEN AS  MUCH DETAIL AS WE'RE PREPARED TO GIVE THAT.  FITNESS FOR USE, LOOK AT THE TECHNIQUES THAT WERE USED TO  DECIDE WHETHER A CANDIDATE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD  ENUMERATION WAS OF SUFFICIENTLY HIGH QUALITY TO BE USED IN LIEU  OF MULTIPLE NONRESPONSE FOLLOW-UP ATTEMPTS, AND  BASICALLY THE CRITERION THERE WAS, IS THE ADMINISTRATIVE  RECORD ENUMERATION LIKELY TO BE OF AT LEAST AS HIGH A QUALITY  AS THE FIRST ROUND NRFU RESPONSE WHEN IT'S PROVIDED BY  HOUSEHOLD MEMBER, SO THAT'S A GOOD LAY OR NONTECHNICAL  SUMMARY OF HOW WE DID IT. THANKS.  ^^ OKAY, GREAT.  INDERDEEP IS NEXT. THE OTHERS HAVE ALREADY GONE IF  YOU COULD PUT YOUR TENT DOWN.  ^^ IN THE ACADEMIC COMMUNITY WE  RELY ON THE CENSUS DATA HEAVILY, USING THE 2006-2010  ACS DATA, SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY EIGHT, NINE YEARS OLD.  EVERY TIME WE MAKE OUR ESTIMATES AND EVALUATE  REPRESENTATION WE'RE CHALLENGED BECAUSE THE DATA ARE SO OLD.  I GUESS MY QUESTION IS WHEN DO YOU THINK THE FILE, THE FILE  THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE, IS 2006-2010, TABULATIONS, FIVE  YEAR ACS DATA, AND IT'S DETAILED CENSUS OCCUPATIONAL  FILE THAT WE USE IN ORDER TO SORT OF EVALUATE WHERE WE ARE  IN TERMS OF REPRESENTATION, AND IT'S ALSO PART OF THE  REGULATIONS THAT WE HAVE TO DO THAT AND EVALUATE CASE ONCE A  YEAR .  ^^ SO, I BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE ASKING IS WHEN THE FIVE-YEAR  FILE INCLUDING THE -- WHICH YEARS ARE YOU --  ^^ SO WHEN WOULD THESE DATA BE AVAILABLE, THESE DATA THAT  WOULD BE BASED ON THE 2020 CENSUS.  SO LAST TIME IT TOOK -- IN 2010 I BELIEVE IT TOOK ABOUT THREE  YEARS FOR THE CENSUS BUREAU TO PUT THAT FILE AND THAT INFORMATION OUT.  ^^ I HAVE AN E-MAIL, I ALSO HAVE --  ^^ MAYBE WE CAN HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT IT OFFLINE  BECAUSE IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME. WE PUT OUT THE FIVE-YEAR DATA  FILE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, AND IT'S ROLLING.  BUT I THINK YOU'RE ASKING WHEN DO WE ANCHOR BASED ON THE 2020  CENSUS. ^^ EXACTLY. ^^ AND I'LL LET TORY ANSWER  THAT ONE. ^^ ARE WE GOING TO ANCHOR ACS  ON THE 2020 CENSUS? ARE YOU ASKING WHEN WE'RE GOING  TO HAVE -- WEIGHT THE ACS TO THE 2020 CENSUS?  THE 2020 DATA PRODUCT COMING OUT OF ACS WILL BE WEIGHTED TO 2020 CENSUS IN 2021.  YOUR MIC IS OFF. ^^ I'M ALSO GOING TO E-MAIL PERHAPS AS NAC  RECOMMENDATION THE SNAP SCHOTT OF THE FILE THAT I'M TALKING  ABOUT. SO IT WILL BE MORE CLEAR AND  YOU CAN GIVE MORE SPECIFIC ANSWER. ^^ OKAY. ^^ I'LL MAIL  THAT TO JULIE. THANK YOU. ^^ GREAT, THANK  YOU. SO WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO THE NEXT PRESENTATION.  ^^ THANK YOU, JASON AND CYNTHIA.  UP NEXT WE HAVE SCHEDULED DEMONSTRATIONS FOR YOU.  IN THE INTEREST OF TIME WE'LL HAVE TWO DEMONSTRATIONS INSTEAD  OF THREE, SO WE DECIDED IT WOULD BE BETTER TO FOCUS ON  CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AS WELL AS  INTERNET SELF-RESPONSE INSTRUMENT AND SAVE  DEMONSTRATION ON THE 2020 CENSUS WEBSITE FOR PERHAPS ANOTHER MEETING. ^^ GOOD MORNING.  SO, I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF INTRODUCING YOU GUYS TO YOUR  TOUR GUIDES FOR THIS NEXT SESSION.  WE'RE GOING TO START OUT WITH ZACK SCHWARTZ OF OUR CENTER FOR  NEW MEDIA AND PROMOTION, AND HE'S GOING TO WALK YOU THROUGH  CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.  AND THEN WE GET TO TURN IT OVER TO ALEXA AND KRISTIN FROM  DECENNIAL MANAGEMENT CENSUS DIVISION, FOR YOUR LONG-AWAITED  DEMO OF THE INTERNET SELF-RESPONSE INSTRUMENT.  I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO ZACH. ^^ GOOD MORNING.  I'M ZACK SCHWARTZ WITH COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTORATE,  RESPONSIBLE FOR A VARIETY OF THINGS, ONE OF THE BIGGEST  WE'RE EXCITED TO SHOW YOU TODAY IS CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP  MANAGEMENT PORTAL, AS WELL AS OUR REPORTING THROUGH OUR  CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE MANAGEMENT TOOL.  THESE ARE INTERNAL TOOLS TO HELP PARTNERSHIP SPECIALISTS AS  WELL AS MANY OTHER PROGRAMS THE BUREAU RELIES ON FOR  PARTNERSHIP-RELATED ACTIVITIES. SUCH AS DATA DISSEMINATION  SPECIALIST, ECONOMIC DIRECTORATE USES IT AS WELL FOR  SOME OF THEIR WORK WITH ECON. WE'RE GOING TO DIVE IN AND DO  LIFE IN THE DAY OF A PARTNERSHIP SPECIALIST,  UTILIZING THE TOOL. WE'LL WALK YOU THROUGH IT, AS  WELL AS HOW THEY DO REPORTING ON THE BACK END.  I WANT TO STRESS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN NOTES THIS IS A  TEST ENVIRONMENT, NONE OF THE DATA WE'RE SHOWING IS TITLE  DATA. WE'RE HERE TO SHOW YOU  FUNCTIONALITY AND HOW THIS TECHNOLOGY IS MAKING LIFE A LOT  EASIER FOR PARTNERSHIP SPECIALISTS AND ABILITY FOR THE  BUREAU TO REACH HARD-TO-COUNT COMMUNITIES USING TECHNOLOGY.  WE'LL START. THIS IS A LANDING PAGE ON THE WEBSITE, POTENTIAL  PARTNERS HAVE ABILITY TO SIGN IN AND ACTUALLY PUT THEIR  INFORMATION AS IF THEY ARE INTERESTED FOR BEING A PARTNER  FOR THE BUREAU. AND SO WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD  AND DO THIS AS IF IT'S A LOCAL CHURCH THAT'S PUTTING IN  INFORMATION BECAUSE THEY ARE INTERESTED.  AGAIN WITH BEING A PARTNER. THEY CAN COME ON THE SITE HERE  AS ONE OF MANY WAYS OF CONNECTING WITH THE BUREAU.  THEY ARE PUTTING IN BASIC INFORMATION, WHERE THEIR  LOCATION IS, NAME AND CONTACT INFORMATION.  THIS HELP US IDENTIFY WHAT REGION THAT THERE WOULD BE  SELECTED FOR AND WHAT PARTNERSHIP STAFF WOULD REACH  OUT TO THEM AS WELL AS THE ORGANIZATIONAL TYPE THAT THE  PARTNERSHIP SPECIALIST IS -- TYPE OF ORGANIZATION THEY  REPRESENT. SO WE'LL GO AHEAD AND PAUSE  HERE REAL QUICK. WHAT WE JUST SWITCHED TO IS  INTERNAL TOOL, CRM, WHICH RUNS ON PEGGA APPLICATION.  THIS TOOL HERE AT THE IN BOX IS OUR WORK BASKET, A WAY FOR  PARTNERSHIP SPECIALISTS TO SEE WHAT POSSIBLE INCOMING PARTNERS  THEY MAY HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE WEB SAOEUFPLT , ONE OF MANY WAYS THEY INPUT PARTNERS.  HIT PLAY. THEY ARE LOOKING AT THE  POTENTIAL PARTNERS THAT HAVE COME FROM THE WEBSITE.  AND SO THEY HAVE CLICKED ON THE PARTNER THAT CAME IN, LOCAL  CHURCH COMMUNITY. AND WHAT THEY HAVE HERE IS THEY  HAVE THE ABILITY TO INPUT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT  WHAT THEIR PRIMARY ADDRESS IS, BACKGROUND INFORMATION,  GENERALLY PARTNERSHIP SPECIALIST WOULD REACH OUT TO  THIS ORGANIZATION, MAKE SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY  ARE SIGNING UP FOR AS A PARTNERSHIP, UNDERSTAND MORE  BACKGROUND ON THEM. WE'RE ASSUMING THEY HAVE DONE  THAT. GO AHEAD AND PAUSE REAL QUICK.  WHAT ONE OF THE EXCITING TOOLS THAT WE HAVE AS BEING A  STATISTICAL AGENCY WE'RE ALL ABOUT DATA QUALITY AND DATA  INTEGRITY. SO WE ARE MAKING SURE AND  UTILIZING TOOLS THAT EXIST THAT THE ADDRESSES BECAUSE THAT'S  CRITICAL FOR WHERE THESE PARTNERS SUPPORT LOCAL  COMMUNITIES ARE CORRECT, WE'RE DOING SOME GEO LOCATION, MAKING  SURE WE HAVE A CORRECT ADDRESS, THERE'S NOT FAT FINGERING OR  ANYTHING LIKE THAT THAT COULD HURT OUR DATA INTEGRITY.  WE'LL GO AHEAD AND CORRECT THE ADDRESS WITH THE SCORE,  UTILIZING CORRECTED ADDRESS, HIT PLAY.  WE HAVE VERIFIED IT, AS THE GREEN CHECK MARK SHOWS.  WHAT WE'RE GOING TO WALK THROUGH IS BACKGROUND ON WHAT  HAPPENS AS WE GO THROUGH AND ACTUALLY ADD AN ORGANIZATION AS  A PARTNER HERE TO THE BUREAU. SO THEY ARE GOING THROUGH AND  ENTERING ORGANIZATIONAL TYPES. AGAIN MAKING SURE THEY HAVE  ENTERED ALL THE ACCURATE INFORMATION, ONE OF THE KEY  THINGS WE ALSO WANT TO CAPTURE IS THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA, OUTREACH  ACTIVITIES. WHAT IS THEIR REACH ONLINE,  WHAT'S THEIR TWITTER HANDLE, THEIR FACEBOOK, ALL OF THAT SO  WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION AS A WAY FOR US TO ALSO MEASURE THE  REACH THAT THESE PARTNERS POSSIBLY WOULD HAVE.  SO WE GO AHEAD AND ENTER IN SOME INFORMATION HERE,  BACKGROUND INFORMATION, TWITTER HANDLES, ET CETERA.  THIS IS, AGAIN, EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WHILE THEY ARE  UTILIZING THIS DESKTOP APPLICATION AND ENTERING THIS  INFORMATION, WE'LL SHOW YOU HERE SHORTLY AS WELL THE MOBILE  APPLICATION USE. WE'RE VERY EXCITED THAT THIS IS  A MOBILE APPLICATION THAT THE PARTNERSHIP SPECIALIST CAN TAKE WHILE ON THE ROAD AS WELL. AGAIN BACK ON THE APPLICATION  HERE WE'RE ENTERING SOME ADDITIONAL PARTNER DETAILS,  IT'S CRITICAL WE UNDERSTAND DEMOGRAPHICS AS WELL AS  GEOGRAPHY THEY SERVE. THIS IS ONE IMPORTANT WAY TO  USE EXAMPLES OF E-MAIL MARKETING.  IF WE HAVE SPECIFIC CONCERNS WITH GEOGRAPHIC OR DEMOGRAPHIC  AREAS, WE CAN QUICKLY CATEGORIZE PARTNERS IN AREAS  THAT SERVE CERTAIN COMMUNITIES. AND REACH THEM DIRECTLY FOR  E-MAIL MARKETING OR OTHER DIRECT COMMUNICATIONS SO WE CAN  ASK THEM TO PUSH MESSAGING OUT THAT'S CRITICAL, IN CASES OF  MIS OR DISINFORMATION OR LOW RESPONSE SCORES.  PAUSE REAL QUICK. ONE THING WE'RE SHOWING IS  INTEGRATE WITH GOOGLE MAPS, AN IMPORTANT TOOL WE HAVE SO THEY  CAN ALSO SEE WHERE THESE PARTNERS ARE SERVING.  HIT PLAY. SO WE'VE CONNECTED WITH TOOL  WITH GREAT PRODUCTS, MAKING EASE OF USE FOR OUR PARTNERSHIP  STAFF. IN ADDITION WE'RE ADDING  CONTACT NOW, ONE OF THE KEY THINGS IS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE  WE KNOW WHO TO REACH AT THESE SPECIFIC PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS.  SO THERE'S AN ABILITY TO ADD MULTIPLE CONTACTS, VERY TYPICAL  OBVIOUSLY OF CRM. WE CAN ENTER IN THEIR  INFORMATION, MAKE SURE THAT'S ALL ACCURATE, AS WE GO THROUGH.  THERE'S A LOT OF CHECKS TO ENSURE THE INFORMATION IS VALID  FROM ONE SCREEN TO ANOTHER. AGAIN, WITH THE LARGE  IMPORTANCE MAKING SURE WE HAVE CONSISTENT DATA AND ACCURATE  DATA, SO THAT STAFF WHO MAY COME IN AFTER THEM, WE MAY  UTILIZE THESE PARTNERS FOR OTHER THINGS DOWN THE LINE HAVE  THE RIGHT INFORMATION. SO WE'RE GOING IN AND NOTING  THE ADDRESS INFORMATION, MAKING SURE THAT'S ALL CORRECT, AGAIN  WITH VERIFIED CHECK MARK, CREATING IT.  AND WE'RE MOVING DOWN HERE AS WE LOOK AT ALL THE INFORMATION  ASSOCIATED, WE CAN QUICKLY SEE ALL THE DATA IS ACTIONABLE.  AND WE'RE GOING TO ADD A COMMITMENT.  ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING THINGS PARTNERSHIP STAFF CAN DO IS NOW  TRACK WHAT ARE THE SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS THESE PARTNERS ARE  MAKING, AND WE CAN IDENTIFY THE COMMITMENTS FROM A BROAD LEVEL,  AT GEOGRAPHIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC LEVEL, SO WE'RE NOTING A  COMMITMENT HERE THAT THEY ARE GOING TO DISTRIBUTE CENSUS  MATERIALS FOR US. IT COULD BE ANYTHING FROM  SOCIAL MEDIA POST THEY ARE GOING TO DO DURING PEAK  OPERATIONS, COULD BE EVENT THEY ARE GOING TO HOLD, VARIETY OF  DIFFERENT THINGS, RECRUITING OPPORTUNITY THAT THEY MAY HAVE.  WE'RE ALSO NOTING OF COURSE WHEN THAT COMMITMENT WILL TAKE  PLACE. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT AS WE  TALK ABOUT REPORTING AT A LATER POINT.  ALL THE DATA WE'RE COLLECTING HERE IS IMPORTANT AND HELPING  PARTNERSHIP STAFF WITH UNDERSTANDING THE TYPES OF WORK PARTNERS WILL DO  DOWN THE LINE. WE'RE CREATING A COMMITMENT.  WE CAN SEE COMMITMENT DETAILS HERE, ALL THE INFORMATION THE  PARTNER HAS PROVIDED US. AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD  AND SAY THEY ARE GOING TO HOLD AN EVENT.  SO AGAIN ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS WE'RE HOPING A LOT OF  PARTNERS WILL DO IS HOLD EVENTS, WHETHER AN OPPORTUNITY  TO TALK ABOUT RECRUITING, TALK ABOUT IMPORTANCE OF THE CENSUS  IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. THEY CAN EASILY SAME SIMILARLY LIKE OTHER EVENTS  LIKE EVENT BRIGHT, CREATE TIMES, LOCATION, ALL THAT'S  INPUT HERE, WE'RE EXCITED TO SHOW YOU CAN ALSO INPUT  CONTACTS. AND WHAT THE CONTACTS DO HERE IN RSVP SENDS AN E-MAIL,  UPLOAD VIA EXCEL OR DIRECTLY INPUT HERE IN THE TOOL.  AND WHAT IT DOES ONCE YOU CREATE EVENT SEND THOSE  ATTENDEES AN E-MAIL ASKING THEM TO RSVP SO YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF  SIZE, WHO WOULD BE ATTENDING, WHO WON'T BE ATTENDING.  AND WE'LL GET TO WHY THAT'S ALSO IMPORTANT WHEN YOU HAVE  THE MOBILE APPLICATION VIEW BECAUSE YOU CAN CHECK PEOPLE  IN. SO LET'S SWITCH OVER AND SHOW  THE MOBILE APPLICATION NOW. AGAIN, THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST  DECENNIAL MOBILE APPS THAT'S BEEN RELEASED.  THIS IS THE FRONT OF IT. IT PLAYS ON THE iPHONES THAT  PARTNERSHIP STAFF HAVE. WE'LL GO THROUGH AND BRING UP  THE ORGANIZATION THAT WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT, FAITH AND  HOPE CHURCH. WE'LL CLICK ON DETAILS HERE.  YOU CAN SEE IT'S VERY USER FRIENDLY.  WE DID A LOT OF TESTING WITH PARTNERSHIP STAFF AND OTHERS TO  MAKE SURE THIS WAS HOW THEY WOULD USE IT, THAT THE LAYOUT  WAS EASY, WHEN YOU'RE ON THE GO YOU DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO  CARRY AROUND YOUR LAPTOP, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A MOBILE FRIENDLY  USER INTERFACE. DETAILS ARE EXISTENT THERE.  YOU CAN SEE WHERE IT WAS, INTEGRATION WITH THE MAPS ON  THE iPHONE AS WELL, WHERE THE EVENT IS, AND WE CAN GO DOWN  AND LOOK AT WHO ACTUALLY IS PLANNING TO ATTEND.  ONE OF THE OTHER INTERESTING THINGS YOU CAN DO IS OBVIOUSLY  EDIT APPLICATIONS HERE. NOW WE CAN PAUSE.  WE'RE ON THE EVENT PAGE. WHAT I'M DOING IS LOOKING AT  WHO ATTENDED, WHO DIDN'T. I CAN MARK ATTENDEES AS  COMPLETE, DON'T HAVE TO HAVE MULTI-POUND LAPTOP, CAN HAVE MY iPHONE AND MARK FOLKS ATTENDED OR NOT.  I CAN ADD ATTENDEES WHO MAY HAVE SHOWN UP WITHOUT RSVPING,  A USER FRIENDLY WAY TO MAKE SURE THEIR JOBS ARE EASY.  WE PAY PARTNERSHIP STAFF TO BE PARTNERSHIP STAFF, NOT TO BE  TECHNOLOGISTS. OUR TEAM IS WORKING EXTREMELY  HARD ACROSS THE BUREAU TO MAKE SURE THIS TECHNOLOGY IS USER  FRIENDLY AS POSSIBLE FOR STAFF IN THE FIELD.  WE CAN GO AHEAD AN HIT PLAY. THIS IS AGAIN A VERY QUICK 'DEM  OPEN OF SOME OF THE KEY USE CASES OF THE CRM.  ONE OF THE BIG THINGS THAT WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT, YOU CAN  SEE DETAILS HERE ASSOCIATED WITH IT, AND THIS VIDEO IS  GOING TO END RIGHT HERE. THAT'S THE CRM IN A QUICK  NUTSHELL, A FEW KEY ASPECTS OF IT.  WE CAN BRING UP THE NEXT VIDEO. I MENTIONED THAT THE BEGINNING  WE ALSO HAVE SOME REALLY COOL FUNCTIONALITY WITH INCLUDING  BUSINESS CARD SCANNING. AGAIN OUR PARTNERSHIP STAFF  MEET TONS OF PEOPLE, THIS IS MY BUSINESS CARD, MEET TONS OF  PEOPLE WHILE AT EVENTS, ABILITY TO QUICKLY CAPTURE INFORMATION  WITHOUT HAVING 100 BUSINESS CARDS IS AS ONE STAFF TOLD ME,  HAVING 100 CARDS IN THEIR POCKET, THIS IS A QUICK AND  EASY WAY TO SCAN DETAILS AND HAVE IT ENTERED IMMEDIATELY  INTO THE CRM. THEY CAN CONNECT THAT CONTACT  TO A SPECIFIC ORGANIZATION AND NOTE OBVIOUSLY WHERE THEY MET  THEM AND ALL THE OTHER DETAILS. AGAIN, TRYING TO PUSH THE EASE  OF TECHNOLOGY AS BEST WE CAN. I'M GOING TO PAUSE.  THAT WAS OUR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT TOOL,  ONE OF MANY TOOLS THAT IS CONNECTED TO ANOTHER INTERNAL  SYSTEM CALLED OUR CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM,  ONE OF OUR 52 SYSTEMS. THIS IS AN EXCITING REPORTING  TOOL THAT'S BASED ON TABLEAU, THIS IS A TOOL THAT BUREAU USES  IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS ACROSS THE BUREAU, DECENNIAL  BEING ONE OF THE MAIN USE CASES.  OUR TEAM DESIGNS FRONT END, MANAGES THE BACK ENDS OF  TABLEAU INSTANCE. WE USE THIS IN A VARIETY OF  DIFFERENT CAPACITIES. ONE OF THE KEYS I WANT TO SHOW  YOU TODAY IS REPORTING FOR OUR PARTNERSHIP STAFF.  AND NOT ONLY HOW OUR LOCAL PARTNERSHIP STAFF USE THIS BUT  ALSO FROM A A HEADQUARTERS DECENNIAL FIELD  PERSPECTIVE. SAMPLE DASHBOARD, THIS IS TEST  ENVIRONMENT, TEST DATA FOR MANY REASONS, WE CAN SEE ACROSS THE  ENTIRE U.S. HERE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE LRS, LOW RESPONSE RATE  SCORES, 20 OR HIGHER. WE CAN IDENTIFY WHERE THE  PERCENTAGES ARE SO WHERE LOW RESPONSE RATE SCORES ARE, AND  CAN LOOK AT WHERE ACTIVE PARTNERS ARE IN THOSE SPECIFIC  AREAS, COMMITMENTS THAT ARE AS WE SHOWED YOU EARLIER THAT  THESE PARTNERS ARE MAKING, WHERE OUR COMPLETE COUNT  COMMITTEES ARE, KEY PARTNER FOR US, AND WHERE THE COMPLETED  EVENTS ARE AS WELL FROM A WEEK'S PERSPECTIVE.  WHEN THERE ARE LOTS OF EVENTS, LOOKING AT RESPONSE RATES, WE  WILL USE DASHBOARDS TO HELP US DETERMINE WHERE TO BEST PUT OUR  PARTNERSHIP SPECIALISTS, WHERE TO BEST FOCUS, WHERE EVENTS MAY  NEED TO BE. THERE'S A LOT OF USE CASES  HERE, WE'LL WALK THROUGH ONE HERE SO WE CAN HIT PLAY.  SO BASICALLY -- THANK YOU. VIDEO IS WALKING YOU THROUGH  EXACT THINGS. I CAN SEE WHERE ACTIVE PARTNERS  ARE. SEE WHERE COMPLETE COUNT  COMMITTEES WERE, DELTAS FROM ONE WEEK TO ANOTHER, SO WE CAN  UNDERSTAND PERCENTAGES. CERTAINLY OUR COMPLETED EVENTS  AS I MENTIONED, A KEY AREA. WE CAN GET DOWN TO SPECIFIC  TRACT LEVEL DATA. WE LOOK FROM U.S. PERSPECTIVE,  COUNTIES, TRACTS, GETS DOWN TO VERY LOW LEVELS OF DETAILS.  WE'LL CLICK ON TEXAS AS AN EXAMPLE.  YOU CLICK ON SOMETHING, THAT SPECIFIC DATA POPS UP FOR THAT  GEOGRAPHY THAT YOU CLICKED ON. I CAN CHANGE IT TO NOW FOCUS ON  PARTNERS. SO WHEN I CHANGE TO PARTNERS,  EVERY DOT IS A PARTNER. OBVIOUSLY MAY BE TOUGH TO SEE  AT AN ENTIRE U.S. LEVEL, BUT WE'LL ZOOM IN SPECIFICALLY TO A  LOCAL RCC LEVEL, DENVER REGION HERE.  AND I CAN SEE BY DENVER, I CAN SEE WHERE PARTNERS ARE, LOOK BY  COUNTY LEVEL, ZOOM IN, IDENTIFY WHERE OUR PARTNERS ARE, SO AS  PARTNERSHIP MANAGER, MANAGING MULTIPLE PARTNERSHIP STAFF, YOU  CAN SEE A LOT OF VERY SPECIFIC DETAIL.  WE'RE GOING TO GO INTO THE STATE OF TEXAS, AS EXAMPLE,  WHICH HAS A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT LRS SCORES HERE.  AND WE CAN PAUSE THE VIDEO BRIEFLY.  BASICALLY WHAT YOU'RE SEEING HERE IS AS A PARTNERSHIP  SPECIALIST, OR MANAGER, OR HEADQUARTER STAFF, I CAN  IDENTIFY WHERE I MIGHT BE LACKING PARTNERS.  WHAT ARE AREAS OF THE COUNTRY THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT  RESPONSE RATE AND WHERE DO I NOT HAVE PARTNERS?  BETTER YET WHERE DO I HAVE PARTNERS WHO CAN HELP ENGAGE  PARTNERS WHERE WE MIGHT HAVE LOW RESPONSE RATES.  AND A LOT OF DATA IS KEY FOR STAFF TO USE AND HEADQUARTERS  TO USE DURING PEAK OPERATIONS. SO WE CAN HIT PLAY.  WE'LL WALK YOU THROUGH AN EXAMPLE AGAIN, FOCUS ON IT  BEING TEST DATA HERE. CLICK ON A LOCAL COUNTY, IT'S  GOING TO CHANGE TO SHOW US SPECIFICALLY WHO ACTIVE  PARTNERS ARE, HOW MANY ACTIVE PARTNERS WE HAVE, LRS  THRESHOLD, AND ZOOM TO GO INTO A DIFFERENT DASHBOARD WHICH IS  WHAT WE CALL ENGAGING THE RIGHT PARTNER.  USE CASE, MAY HAVE A COUNTY WITH LOW RESPONSE RATE SCORE,  WE WANT TO KNOW WHO PARTNERS ARE AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WHERE  ARE AREAS WE DON'T HAVE PARTNERS THAT WE NEED STAFF TO  MAKE SURE WE ENGAGE IN THEM. AS WE LOOK AT THIS WE CAN ALSO  IDENTIFY A LOT OF DEMOGRAPHIC DATA AROUND THIS SPECIFIC  GEOGRAPHY, WE MAY KNOW TYPES OF COMMUNITY RELATIONSHIPS THAT  EXIST HERE, WE'RE USING ACS DATA.  LOOK AT THE SIZES, POPULATION, LOOKED AT AGE AS EXAMPLE.  I CAN GET DOWN INTO VERY LOW LEVEL GEOGRAPHY DETAILS, AND SHOW SPECIFICS HAPPENING HERE.  I CAN USE ZOOMING TOOLS, ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY, TABLEAU  PUT IN PLACE TO MAKE IT USER FRIENDLY AND FOCUS ON SPECIFIC  DEMOGRAPHIC DATA YOU WANT FOR THE GEOGRAPHY YOU'RE LOOKING AT  HERE. SO AGAIN WE'RE LOOKING AT  VARIETY OF LANGUAGE, THERE'S AGE, ALL KIND OF THINGS THAT WOULD COME WITH THE  GEOGRAPHY LISTED HERE. CHANGING IT TO LOOK AT  DIFFERENT TIMES OF -- TYPES OF PARTNERS, EVENTS.  IF WE PAUSE, FOCUS ON BOTTOM. THIS IS AGAIN A KEY TOOL FROM  HEADQUARTERS PERSPECTIVE AS WELL AS SOME REGIONAL  LEADERSHIP. WHERE ARE EVENTS HAPPENING?  ON THAT MAP VIEW I CAN IDENTIFY DURING CERTAINLY PEAK  OPERATIONS WHAT ARE EVENTS OCCURRING ON THAT SPECIFIC DAY,  THAT SPECIFIC WEEK, AS WE HAVE CONCERNS OR WE WANT TO SEE  WHAT'S HAPPENING IN A SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHY ALL THAT DATA THAT  WAS SO CRITICAL, WHY WE MAKE YOU -- VERIFY ADDRESS, IT  TRANSLATES HERE. WE CAN IDENTIFY AT HQ OR  REGIONAL LEADERSHIP LEVEL WHERE EVENTS ARE, WHAT'S HAPPENING.  HIT PLAY. AND DETAILS WILL POP UP FOR US.  WE CAN MAKE SURE WE'RE TARGETING THOSE WITH ADDITIONAL  RESOURCES, SOCIAL MEDIA ON OUR TEAM CAN MAKE SURE WE'RE  ADVERTISING THOSE EVENTS IN THE RIGHT AREA.  WE CAN PUBLISH USING ADVERTISING DOLLARS TO MAKE  SURE WE'RE PUSHING THESE EVENTS AS WELL SUPPORTING LOCAL  PARTNERSHIP STAFF. PARTNERSHIP DETAILS PAGE WHICH  WE WON'T OPEN UP HAS THE SPECIFICS LAID OUT IN EXCEL,  DOWNLOAD DATA, TAKE IT WITH THEM, SIMILAR TO THE REST OF  PRODUCTS THAT WE OFFER HERE. SO OVERALL THAT'S HOW WE USE  OUR CRM AND SEM, ONE USE CASE, SEC NOTHING FOCUSED FOR EASE OF  USE MAKING IT SO PARTNERSHIP STAFF AND HEADQUARTERS CAN  MANAGE AND WORK FROM THESE TOOLS.  DASHBOARDS WILL BE USED OUTSIDE OF PARTNERSHIP, RESPONSE RATE,  THERE'S A LOT OF USE THE SEM IS PROVIDING THE BUREAU.  I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND HOPE YOU ENJOYED THE DEMO.  I'LL PASS IT OVER TO ALEXA. ^^ THANKS, ZACK. ^^ WE'RE  GOING TO DO BOTH AND QUESTIONS, JERI. KEEP YOUR THING UP. ^^ ALL RIGHT.  GOOD MORNING. WHILE SHE'S GETTING SET UP,  IT'S COMING UP ON THE SCREEN, I'M GOING TO GO THROUGH A FEW  QUICK POINTS BEFORE WE START THE DEMO, I'M ALEXA JONES-PUTHOFF.  I'M HERE TODAY WITH KRISTEN HERNS, THE BRANCH CHIEF,  RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ISR OPERATION IN WHOLE WHICH  INCLUDES THE ISR INSTRUMENT AS WELL.  JUST A FEW THINGS. IF YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING OUR  DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNET SELF-RESPONSE TOOLS THIS WILL  BE FAMILIAR TO YOU. IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE  FIELDED IN 2018, AND WANT TO MENTION WE DID FIELD AN INTERNET TEST IN 2018, AND HAVE USED THIS TOOL THAT YOU'LL SEE TODAY.  THE 2020 ISR INSTRUMENT HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY TESTED, SIX  ROUNDS OF TESTING, THREE ROUNDS OF USABILITY TESTING, DESKTOP  AND MOBILE. THE ISR INSTRUMENT HAS BEEN  TESTED BY OUR CENTER AND RTI INTERNATIONAL WHO CONDUCTED  TEST OF NONENGLISH LANGUAGES WITH 130 RESPONDENTS, AND HAVE  BEEN LEVERAGING EXPERTS IN THE BUREAU TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE  TOOL VARIOUS DEVELOPMENT STAGES AND PROVIDE COMMENTS AND  FEEDBACK TO US. THE ISR INSTRUMENT IS MOBILE  OPTIMIZED. WE'VE TESTED ON DESKTOP,  LAPTOP, TABLET, WINDOWS AND APPLE OPERATING SYSTEMS, IOS  AND ANDROID, THAT TESTING IS ONGOING, AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE.  WE'VE BEEN COMMITTED TO MAKING ISR INSTRUMENT ACCESSIBLE.  IT'S 508 COMPLIANT, AND TESTING WILL LEVERAGE ACCESSIBILITY  COMPONENTS THROUGHOUT THIS MONTH.  AND WITH THAT I WILL TURN IT OVER TO KRISTEN TO WALK YOU  THROUGH THE INSTRUMENT. ^^ THANK YOU, ALEXA.  IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'LL DO AN I OF -- AN I.D. CASE AND  SUBMIT SO YOU CAN SEE QUESTIONS, DEMOGRAPHIC  QUESTIONS, ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS.  THIS IS A TYPICAL RESPONDENT. IF WE HAVE TIME I CAN SHOW YOU  NONI.D. ADDRESS COLLECTION SCREENS.  THIS IS THE PAGE THAT RESPONDENTS SEE WHEN THEY  ACCESS THE INTERNET SELF-RESPONSE ONLINE  QUESTIONNAIRE. WE REFER TO THIS AS LANDING  PAGE. AS YOU CAN SEE, WE GIVE THEM  SOME GENERAL INFORMATION, ABOUT THE CENSUS, HOW TO GET STARTED.  ONE THING TO NOTE FOR 2020 AND THIS WAS THE CASE IN 18,  QUESTIONNAIRE MUST BE COMPLETED IN ONE SITTING.  IF A RESPONDENT BREAKS OFF FOR ANY REASON, TIMES OUT, CLOSES  BROWSER, THEY MUST START FROM THE BEGINNING.  THIS IS FOR REASONS FOR SECURITY.  WE ALSO PROVIDE FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS.  WHAT IS THE 2020 CENSUS? ARE THEY REQUIRED TO RESPOND TO THE CENSUS?  CONFIDENTIALITY AND PRIVACY. WHO SHOULD COMPLETE THE CENSUS,  HOW TO CHANGE ANSWERS, HOW LONG WILL THE 2020 CENSUS  QUESTIONNAIRE TAKE, IT'S AROUND TEN MINUTES.  HOW WILL THE INFORMATION BE USED.  WILL THE RESULTS BE PUBLISHED, DETAILS ABOUT THAT.  AND DO I HAVE TO COMPLETE THE 2020 CENSUS?  WE ALSO PROVIDE INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE USE OF THE ONLINE  OPTION, WHO SHOULD COMPLETE, NAVIGATION INFORMATION, HOW TO  CHANGE RESPONSES, SESSION TIME LIMIT WHICH I MENTIONED BEFORE  WHICH IS 15 MINUTES, IF THE PAGE IS IDLE FOR 13 MINUTES A  POP-UP WILL APPEAR THAT INSTRUCTS THEM IT WILL BE  TIMING OUT. WE ALSO PROVIDE HELP FOR EACH  QUESTION IN THE INSTRUMENT, I'LL POINT THAT OUT WHEN WE GO  THROUGH IT. AND THEN ABOUT SUBMITTING YOUR  2020 CENSUS QUESTIONNAIRE. AS YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE  LANGUAGES DISPLAYED AT THE TOP AND BOTTOM.  WE HAVE ENGLISH, 12 ENGLISH LANGUAGES, I'LL GIVE YOU A DEMO  HERE. SO SPANISH, ARABIC, BACK TO  ENGLISH, RESPONDENT CAN CHANGE LANGUAGES AS FREQUENTLY AS  OFTEN AS THEY CHOOSE THROUGH THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE  QUESTIONNAIRE. THESE OPTIONS WILL BE AVAILABLE  ON EACH AND EVERY PAGE. SO WE'LL GET STARTED.  ENTER AN I.D., MY CENSUS I.D. PDF OF WHERE RESPONDENT CAN  FIND THEIR I.D. THE I.D. CAN BE FOUND IN THE  LETTER ON THE POSTCARD, ON THE QUESTIONNAIRE, AND ALSO ON THE  NOTICE OF VISIT. THIS IS WHERE A RESPONDENT  WOULD CLICK IF THEY DECIDED TO GO NONI.D., OR WITHOUT AN I.D ALSO MENTIONED THIS IS A TEST  ENVIRONMENT, IT IS A LITTLE SLUGGISH BECAUSE WE'RE BEHIND  THE FIRE WALL. WE'LL BE DOING ADDITIONAL  TESTING WITH AN ENVIRONMENT THAT MORE CLOSELY RESEMBLES  PRODUCTION SO WE'LL BE ABLE TO SEE WHAT THE USER EXPERIENCE  WILL BE. FIRST QUESTION WE ASK, ARE YOU  COMPLETING THE 2020 CENSUS FOR THE ADDRESS BELOW, AND THIS IS  TEST DATA. BUT THIS ADDRESS IS ASSOCIATED  WITH CENSUS I.D. THAT WAS PUT IN THE LOG-IN.  I'LL SAY YES. AND THEN WE ASKED ON APRIL 1  WILL YOU BE LIVING OR STAYING AT THE ADDRESS, AND I'LL SAY  YES. THIS IS WHERE WE START  GATHERING INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESPONDENT AND OTHER PEOPLE IN  THE HOUSEHOLD. I WILL MENTION HERE THAT WE DO  REQUIRE RESPONDENT TO PROVIDE A NAME, AT LEAST SOME IDENTIFYING  INFORMATION. PHONE NUMBER IS NOT REQUIRED. FOR THE HELP TEXT, WE ALSO  PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT WHY WE'RE ASKING FOR THE NAME. ^^ A QUICK QUESTION.  PHONE NUMBER IS NOT REQUIRED BUT IT'S THERE, DOES THAT MEAN  THAT IT WILL PROCEED IF THEY DON'T LIST IT, IF THEY CLICK  NEXT IT WILL JUST GO TO THE NEXT?  ^^ IT WILL PROMPT THEM TO PROVIDE A PHONE NUMBER, AND  THEN IF THEY SELECT NEXT FOR A SECOND TIME THEY CAN PROCEED. ^^ OKAY.  ^^ HERE WE'RE ASKING HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL BE LIVING OR  STAYING AT THE ADDRESS ON APRIL 1.  HERE IS SOME HELP TEXT I REFERRED TO, LET THEM KNOW  WHO TO INCLUDE AND NOT TO INCLUDE, RESIDENCE CRITERIA, IF THEY ARE UNSURE OR HAVE A QUESTION.  THEN I'LL SAY TWO. SO THIS POP COUNT IS ALSO A  REQUIRED FIELD, I HAVE TO PROVIDE A NUMBER FROM 1 TO 99,  IF A RESPONDENT DOES NOT PROVIDE AN ANSWER THEN THEY ARE  GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS TO START OVER, CALL CQA OR FILL OUT A  PAPER FORM. A POP COUNT IS A REQUIRED FIELD. HERE WE'RE ASKING FOR EACH  PERSON WHO WILL BE LIVING OR STAYING AT THE ADDRESS ON APRIL  1, SINCE I SAID THERE WERE TWO PEOPLE LIVING AT THE ADDRESS ON  THE PREVIOUS SCREEN IT LISTS MY NAME AND ALSO GIVES ME ONE BOX  TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESPONDENT NAME FOR THE OTHER  PERSON. I CAN ADD ADDITIONAL PEOPLE  HERE IF I DECIDE THAT THERE ARE ACTUALLY THREE PEOPLE INSTEAD  OF TWO PEOPLE LIVING THERE. AND WE DO COLLECT BOTH  RESPONSES. WE COLLECT THE ORIGINAL POP  COUNT AND WE COLLECT THE CALCULATED POP COUNT. AND THIS IS WHAT WE CALL THE  UNDERCOUNT SCREEN. SO WE DO NOT WANT TO MISS  ANYONE WHO MIGHT BE STAYING AT THE ADDRESS ON APRIL 1.  FOR EXAMPLE, CHILDREN RELATED OR UNRELATED SUCH AS NEWBORN  BABIES, GRANDCHILDREN, FOSTER CHILDREN.  RELATIVES, ROOMMATES, OTHER NONRELATIVITIES, PEOPLE WITHOUT  A PERMANENT PLACE TO LIVE. IT LIVES WHAT I LISTED AND  ASKED IF THERE ARE ADDITIONAL PEEL -- PEOPLE I DIDN'T ALREADY LIST. PROVIDE RESIDENCE CRITERIA IN  CASE THEY HAVE QUESTIONS WHO SHOULD BE INCLUDED.  I'LL SAY YES. THAT PERSON WILL ALSO BE ADDED  TO THE ROSTER. HERE WE ASK IF THE HOUSE  APARTMENT OR MOBILE HOME WILL BE OWNED WITH MORTGAGE OR LOAN,  OWNED FREE AND CLEAR, RENTED, OCCUPIED WITHOUT PAYMENT OF  RENT. I'LL SAY OWN. AND THEN WE ASK OF THE PEOPLE  WHO WILL BE LIVING AT THE ADDRESS WHO WILL OWN THE HOUSE,  AMOUNT, OR MOBILE HOME ON APRIL 1.  I'LL SAY JOHN SMITH. THIS PARTICULAR QUESTION  DETERMINES WHO REFERENCE PERSON IS, AND REFERENCE PERSON WILL  BE THE FIRST PERSON LISTED ON THE ROSTER, AND WILL BE THE  PERSON WHO EVERYONE ELSE IN THE HOUSEHOLD WILL BE RELATED TO  WHEN YOU GET TO THE RELATIONSHIP QUESTION. ^^ I'M GOING TO -- WE WERE  GOING TO WAIT BUT IT'S MORE SENSE TO ASK QUESTIONS AS WE GO  THROUGH THE SLIDES BECAUSE THIS IS OUR LAST PRESENTATION AND  I'LL GO BACK. IN TWO PEOPLE OWN THE HOME,  MORTGAGE WITH TWO NAMES, DOES IT ALLOW YOU TO PUT MORE THAN ONE PERSON?  ^^ THE FIRST PERSON WILL BE THE REFERENCE. ^^ THE FIRST PERSON  WHOSE BOX IS TICKED OFF WILL BE LIKE HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD BUT YOU  CAN PUT MORE THAN ONE NAME? ^^ UH-HUH, YES.  YOU CAN CLICK ALL OF THE NAMES, SOME OF THE NAMES, NONE OF THE  ABOVE. SO THIS IS WHAT WE CALL THE  DASHBOARD. ESSENTIALLY IT'S THE ROSTER OR  EVERYONE LIVING OR STAYING ON APRIL 1.  WE'LL START WITH JOHN SMITH.  THE FIRST QUESTION IS WHAT IS JOHN SMITH'S SEX. THEN WHAT IS THE DATE OF BIRTH  AND AGE. CALCULATES AGE FOR THAT  PARTICULAR RESPONDENT, IF THE RESPONDENT PROVIDES ENOUGH  INFORMATION TO CALCULATE THE AGE.  NOW, WE DO ALLOW RESPONDENTS TO CHANGE AGE, AND  WE COLLECT CALCULATED AGE AS WELL AS THE STATED AGE. NEXT IS THE HISPANIC, LATINO OR  SPANISH ORIGIN. WE DO NOT ALLOW YES OR NO  RESPONSE. I SELECT NO.  THEN YES. NO--  ^^ CAN YOU CLICK OFF MORE THAN ONE LATINO ORIGIN?  ^^ YOU CAN. ^^ THAT WILL BE TABULATED?  ^^ YOU HAVE TO ASK MY POP FOLKS ABOUT THE TABULATION QUESTION.  ^^ REAL QUICK, FOR THE BOX THAT YOU'RE FILLING IN NOW, OUR  UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU CAN PUT UP TO 200 CHARACTERS BUT  THE BOX LOOKS FAIRLY SMALL SO IT MAY NOT BE INTUITIVE TO  PEOPLE THEY CAN ENTER IN MORE DATA THAN THAT.  ^^ IT'S 200 CHARACTERS, YES. ^^ YEAH, LET ME SEE HERE. THERE YOU GO.  AS THEY CONTINUE WRITING CHARACTERS, THE BOX WILL EXPAND. OKAY. ^^ WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR THE  NEXT SCREEN TO LOAD WHAT ABOUT NONI.D. RESPONSE?  WE HAVE POINT OF SERVICE PEOPLE, PEOPLE WHO -- HOMELESS  INDIVIDUALS, ET CETERA, WHO DON'T HAVE A MAIL-IN I.D., WE STARTED WITH ENTER YOUR I.D. ^^ CLICK HERE  IF YOU DON'T HAVE A CENSUS I. D., WHICH -- WE CAN GO BACK  AND SHOW YOU WHAT THE SCREENS LOOK LIKE.  HERE IS THE RACE QUESTION.  200 WRITE-IN CHARACTER FIELDS, SELECT AS MANY RESPONSE OPTIONS  AS YOU WANT. IF I COLLECT RESPONSE OPTION,  LEAVE TEXT FIELD BLANK, YOU WILL RECEIVE THE SOFT EDIT. THAT SAYS PLEASE PROVIDE  RESPONSE SO THIS PERSON DOES NOT HAVE AN ANSWER, CONTINUE TO  THE NEXT PAGE SO I CAN CONTINUE WITHOUT ENTERING ANYTHING IN  THESE FIELDS. BUT WE HIGHLIGHT THEM ALSO SO  THEY ARE AWARE OF WHAT INFORMATION IS MISSING THAT WE  WOULD LIKE THEM TO PROVIDE. SO NOW ALL OF THE QUESTIONS FOR  JOHN SMITH ARE COMPLETED. WE'LL GO TO THE SECOND PERSON.  AND PERSONS 2 THROUGH 99, FIRST QUESTION IS RELATIONSHIP  QUESTION. THIS IS THE RELATIONSHIP  QUESTION, I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH. ^^ TYCO, DO YOU WANT TO ASK?  ^^ HAS THERE BEEN TESTING ON WHETHER THAT'S NOT LIKELY TO  INDUCE HIGHER RATE OF SUBGROUP IDENTIFICATION FOR THE ONLINE  SELF REPORT AS OPPOSED TO WRITTEN? ^^ YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WHETHER  OR NOT THERE'S -- I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE BOXES TO POP UP,  MAYBE THAT'S ON YOUR PHONE, NICHOLAS WILL BE THE PERSON TO  ANSWER QUESTIONS RELATED TO THIS.  ^^ IN 2018 WE DID HAVE UNFOLDING TEXT BOXES, BUT WHEN  WE DID USABILITY TESTING WE FOUND RESPONDENTS WANTED TO  KNOW THERE WAS A WRITE-IN FIELD.  ONE EXAMPLE THEY USED WAS AN ARABIC RESPONDENT DIDN'T WANT  TO SAY THEY WERE WHITE AS PART OF WHITE CATEGORY BUT WERE  WILLING TO WRITE ARABIC UNDER WHITE BECAUSE THAT'S I BELIEVE  ONE OF THE EXAMPLES. WE PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY OF  RESPONDENT TO PROVIDE WHAT INFORMATION THEY SELF IDENTIFY  WITH. ^^ IF THAT PERSON WRITES IN,  SAY, ARABIC, MIDDLE EASTERN, UNDER WHITE BUT DOESN'T TICK  THE WHITE BOX ARE THEY COUNTED AS WHITE?  THAT'S INTERESTING. ^^ WE'RE FOLLOWING THE OMB  STANDARDS, BUT WE'RE NOT REQUIRING RESPONDENT TO CHECK  SOMETHING THEY DON'T IDENTIFY WITH.  THEY ARE ABLE TO WRITE A RESPONSE ON ANY OF THE LINES  THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM, AND THAT'S GOING TO INFLUENCE HOW  WE TABULATE DATA MOVING FORWARD.  SO WE'RE RESPECTING RESPONSE, WE'RE COLLECTING IT, WE'RE  STILL GOING TO TABULATE BASED ON OMB STANDARDS BUT IN THIS  EXAMPLE IF SOMEONE WERE TO REPORT DETAILED WHITE RESPONSE  LIKE LEBANESE ON A LINE THAT'S NOT WHITE WE'LL STILL COLLECT  IT AND TABULATE IT AS PART OF THE WHAT THE OF WHITE CATEGORY  BUT IF THEY CHECK ASSOCIATED BOX,  BLACK, AMERICAN INDIAN, WE'LL COLLECT BOTH.  WE TALKED ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY. ^^ IF THEY PUT, SAY, UNDERNEATH  WHITE THEY PUT LEBANESE THEY WOULD GO IN WHITE.  IN THEY PUT LEBANESE UNDER OTHER RACE FOR EXAMPLE THEY  WOULD REMAIN OTHER RACE LEBANESE. ^^ NO, NOT IN THAT  CASE. SOME OTHER RACE IS DISTINCT  CATEGORY LOOKING TO COLLECT INFORMATION THROUGH RESPONSE  BOX. IF WE PLACE ACCORDING TO OMB  STANDARDS THAT'S WHERE IT WILL REMAIN.  GERMAN UNDER WHITE, JAMAICAN UNDER BLACK, SOME OTHER RACE  WOULD GO AWAY BECAUSE WE KNOW THE RACE THEY REPORTED,  ACCORDING TO OMB STANDARDS. ^^ THEY WROTE REMEMBER NIECE UNDER  OTHER THEY WOULD BE RECLASSIFIED AS WHITE BECAUSE  OMB CLASSIFIES AS WHITE. LATINO DOESN'T HAVE AN OMB  RACIAL DESIGNATION. ^^ OKAY.  ^^ I GOT IT.  ^^ MY QUESTION IS WHETHER THERE'S TESTING ON A MODE BASED  DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF LIKELIHOOD OF WRITING LET'S SAY  GERMAN UNDER WHITE. ^^ WE DID MODE BASED IN 2015 NCT THE ONE  THAT REALLY STARTED A LOT OF THIS WORK LOOKING AT THE MODE  BASED DIFFERENCES. I CAN GO BACK AND BRING YOU  MORE DETAILS AND SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE.  ONE THINGS WE WANTED TO DO WITH THIS WARNING FOR ONLINE  RESPONSES IS HELP PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THEY WERE PROMPTED TO  REPORT DETAILED ORIGINS, THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN UNDER WHITE OR  BLACKS, SOFT EDITING HELPED PEOPLE RECOGNIZE WE'RE LOOKING  FOR THAT INFORMATION. ^^ CHEROKEE, DID YOU HAVE A  QUESTION? GO AHEAD.  ^^ CHEROKEE BRADLEY, ARKANSAS. I MIGHT HAVE JUMPED THE GUN IN  REGARDS TO MY QUESTION ON THIS TOOL YESTERDAY BUT I WANT TO  REVISIT THAT, THAT YOU MENTIONED THE TOOL IS  ASSESSABLE, I UNDERSTAND FROM THE SHORT CONVERSATION  YESTERDAY YOU CLARIFIED IT HAD NOT BEEN TESTED BY PERSONS WITH  SENSORY OR COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT.  MY CONCERN IS THE TOOL ITSELF MIGHT BE 508 LEVEL COMPLIANT  BUT IF IT HAS NOT BEEN TESTED DUE TO ROLL OUT IN THE SPRING  BY PERSONS WITH THOSE IMPAIRMENTS, IS 508-2 LEVEL  AVAILABLE AND NOT ACCESSIBLE, YOU'LL HAVE PERSONS GO LIVE  WITH CENSUS, PREPARED TO TAKE THE CENSUS, THEY ARE NOT ABLE  TO. I THINK WE SHOULD BE PRO-ACTIVE  PRIOR TO THAT TIME TO ENSURE SOME TESTING IS CONDUCTED.  I REALLY HAVE A QUESTION ON HOW ARE YOU DEFINING ACCESSIBILITY.  ^^ SO, WE'RE CURRENTLY TESTING 508 COMPLIANCE WITH 2.0 AA STANDARDS.  WE'VE NOT TESTED RESPONDENTS WITH COGNITIVE DISABILITIES,  WHAT YOU BROUGHT UP YESTERDAY. HOWEVER, THE QUESTIONS FOR THE  2020 CENSUS ON AVERAGE ARE WRITTEN AT 8th GRADE READING  LEVEL. ADDITIONALLY WE CONDUCTED  THOROUGH COGNITIVE USABILITY TESTING, WE FEEL CONFIDENT THAT MOST PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO FILL THIS OUT.  IF THEY ARE HAVING DIFFICULTY WE PROUD CQA NUMBER THEY CAN  CALL AND HAVE AN AGENT WALK THEM THROUGH THE QUESTIONNAIRE.  ^^ THERE ARE A NUMBER OF, CENSUS IDENTIFIES 54 MILLION  PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES.  NOT EVERYONE WILL BE ABLE TO CALL THE NUMBER.  ARE THERE ANY SCREENERS, ANYONE THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO ASSIST  THOSE PERSONS WHO JUST DON'T HAVE FULL USE BUT ARE EXPECTED  TO COMPLETE THE CENSUS? OR ENCOURAGE, I'M SORRY,  ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO BE COUNTED AND COMPLETE THE CENSUS?  ^^ WE'LL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU WITH THAT QUESTION.  I WAS LOOKING FOR -- MARISA, ARE YOU HERE?  OKAY. THANKS, DEB. ^^ HI, GOOD MORNING.  DEB STEMPOWSKI, I THINK WHAT WE'VE DONE IN PROVIDING THE  NUMBER OF MODES IT'S NOT ONLY KRISTIN MENTIONED CENSUS  QUESTIONNAIRE ASSISTANCE, THERE'S ALSO PAPER FORM THAT'S  AVAILABLE. THEN AS WELL, RIGHT, SOMEBODY  COMING TO YOUR DOOR IF YOU DON'T RESPOND IS THERE, AS THE  PRIMARY OPTIONS, I THINK ALSO WHAT WE HAVE IN THE FIELD AND  WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ARE THERE PLACES WHERE WE PUT OUR MOBILE  QACs, WHERE WE CAN GIVE HELP. I THINK WE'VE OFFERED WHAT WE  BELIEVE IS A BROAD RANGE OF WAYS FOR FOLKS TO RESPOND, I'M  NOT SURE IF THERE'S SOMETHING SPECIFIC YOU WANT TO PUT IN THE  RECOMMENDATIONS IN TERMS OF US TESTING THAT WE CAN LOOK AT,  GIVEN WHERE WE ARE. IS THAT POSSIBLE?  ^^ ALL PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES ARE AVAILABLE. ^^  ABSOLUTELY. ^^ MORE SO I THINK THAT IF YOU CANNOT RELATE TO A  PERSON WHO HAS MODERATE LET'S SAY JUST TO GET DOWN IN THE  WEEDS, MENTAL RETARDATION, LIMITED ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND  RELATE TO SOME, BE ABLE TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS ON THE  FORM, THEN I'M THINKING IN TERMS OF LET'S SAY MY  80-YEAR-OLD GRANDMOTHER WHO SENSORY DUE TO DEMENTIA HAS  DECLINED SEVERELY CAN BARELY REMEMBER TO FEED HERSELF DUE TO ALZHEIMER'S. ^^ I GO TO IF SHE'S GETTING ASSISTANCE FROM SOMEONE, IS SHE IN  ASSISTED FACILITY? ^^ THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE.  ^^ THESE ARE FOLKS LIVING ON THEIR OWN WHO HAVE CHALLENGES,  AS YOU NOTED, WHO NEED HELP FILLING OUT THE CENSUS.  I THINK, YOU KNOW, THERE WOULD BE EVENTS THAT ARE THERE, I  DON'T KNOW THAT THEY COULD GO TO THEM, BUT WE'VE PROVIDED  FROM INTERNET, THE PHONE, ACTUALLY PHONE MAY BE CALLING  IF THEY CAN'T CALL, I UNDERSTAND THAT.  FILLING OUT THE PAPER QUESTIONNAIRE.  AND THEN IF THEY DON'T RESPOND SOMEONE WILL COME TO THEIR HOME  AND COLLECT THEIR RESPONSE. SO IS THAT THE FORM OF  ASSISTANCE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?  SO DURING NONRESPONSE FOLLOW-UP, IT IS DOOR TO DOOR,  WHERE CENSUS BUREAU WORKER WHO IS SWORN WOULD COLLECT THEIR  INFORMATION. ^^ THIS IS TIM OLSON.  IF I COULD ADD TO THAT, LET'S SAY THE EXAMPLE, YOU PROVIDED  AN OLDER PERSON WHO HAS GOT DEMENTIA, ET CETERA, LET'S SAY  THEY DON'T SELF RESPOND. DURING NONRESPONSE FOLLOW-UP  WHEN THE ENUMERATOR CENSUS TAKER GOES TO THE HOUSEHOLD  LET'S SAY THEY DON'T ANSWER THE DOOR, FOR WHATEVER REASON.  THEY WILL LEAVE A NOTICE OF VISIT DURING MULTIPLE CONTACT  ATTEMPTS, HOPEFULLY WHEN YOU GO TO VISIT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE  THAT. AND YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE A  CONTACT BACK TO US, THERE WILL BE INSTRUCTIONS ON THERE, SO THAT YOU CAN ASSIST THIS  GRANDMOTHER, I BELIEVE YOU SAID.  ASSIST YOUR GRANDMOTHER COMPLETING THE FORM.  ^^ OKAY. I'M GOING TO ROLL US BACK TO  OUR PRESENTATION BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE WE'VE GOTTEN INTO THE  WEEDS HERE. NOT THAT IT'S NOT AN IMPORTANT  POINT BUT THAT INDIVIDUAL WOULD HAVE AN ISSUE WITH A PAPER FORM  OR ONLINE FORM OR ANY FORM, RIGHT?  SO THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING WE CAN INTRODUCE INTO THE  RECOMMENDATIONS MAKING SURE THERE'S ACCESS AND SUPPORT  AVAILABLE, PARTNERSHIPS WITH PEOPLE WHO WORK WITH  DISABILITIES WHO CAN MAKE SURE THEY CAN GET TO INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT HAVE  INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES. LET'S SCROLL BACK TO THE  PRESENTATION. ^^ THANK YOU.  THE REST OF THE QUESTIONS ARE THE SAME FOR EVERY PERSON.  SEX, DATE OF BIRTH, HISPANIC ORIGIN, RACE.  I'LL QUICKLY GO THROUGH THESE. I'LL MENTION HERE THAT IF --  SINCE WE OFFER LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH AND SPANISH, IF A  RESPONDENT ENTERING SOMETHING IN THE FIELD THAT'S ONE OF OUR  SUPPORTED LANGUAGES, LET'S SAY RUSSIAN, THAT RESPONSE WILL BE  SENT TO TRANSLATION AND WILL BE TRANSLATED BY OUR TRANSLATORS  AT THE TUCSON CALL CENTER. I CAN SHOW YOU NON-I.D. SCREENS  I'M GOING TO REMOVE JIM SMITH. I GET A CONFIRMATION THAT ARE  YOU SURE YOU WANT TO REMOVE JIM SMITH FROM YOUR HOUSEHOLD.  I'LL SAY YES. ^^ A QUICK QUESTION, I'M  CURIOUS, WHETHER YOU'RE KEEPING THIS META DATA THAT'S BEING  SELECTED. ^^ YES.  EVERY CLICK A RESPONDENT MAKES WE COLLECT DATA FOR, PARA DATA.  WE'LL MOVE TO THE FINAL QUESTIONS. HERE WE'RE ASKING A RESPONDENT  IF THEY MAY HAVE LIVED OR STAYED -- SOME PEOPLE LIVE OR  STAY IN MORE THAN ONE PLACE, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS  COUNTED ONLY ONCE. WE HAVE SEVERAL EXAMPLES WITH A  PARENT, GUARDIAN, OTHER PERSON, COLLEGE, MILITARY, JOB, NURSING  HOME, JAIL OR PRISON, SEASON OR SECONDARY RESIDENCE.  I'LL SELECT JOHN. WE ASK WHERE DOES JOHN SMITH  USUALLY LIVE OR STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE.  AND WE'LL SAY HE WAS TO BE CLOSER TO A JOB OR BUSINESS. THAT IS ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT  WE HAVE FOR THE CENSUS QUESTIONNAIRE, SAME AS PAPER.  AND THEN SO WE LET THE RESPONDENT KNOW THEY ARE ALMOST  FINISHED, READY TO SUBMIT RESPONSES.  WE ALLOW ONE MORE OPTION TO EDIT, THEY CAN GO BACK TO THE  DASHBOARD AND EDIT DEMOGRAPHIC QUESTIONS.  IF THEY ARE READY TO SUBMIT, SELECT SUBMIT QUESTIONNAIRE. WE PROVIDE THEM WITH A  CONFIRMATION PAGE THAT THEY COMPLETED CENSUS FOR THIS  ADDRESS, DATE, PROVIDE ADDITIONAL NUMBER IF THEY HAVE  ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. AND THEN THEY ALSO CAN SAVE OR  PRINT THE SCREEN IF THEY CHOOSE TO.  THAT'S THE I.D. RESPONSE. I CAN QUICKLY GO TO NON-I.D.  THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NON-I.D. AND I.D., WE ASK FOR  ADDRESS IN PLACE OF THE CENSUS I.D. THEY MAY NOT HAVE.  IF YOU DON'T HAVE A CENSUS I. D., CLICK HERE. ^^ THIS IS THE NON-I.D.  RESPONSE LIKE FOR A HOMELESS INDIVIDUAL WHO DOESN'T HAVE A  RESIDENCE FOR EXAMPLE? ^^ YES.  ^^ OUR PRIMARY OPERATION TO COUNT HOMELESS RESIDENTS IS THE  SERVICE-BASED ENUMERATION OPERATION BUT SHE'S GOING TO  SHOW YOU HOW IF THEY SHOULD USE THE ISR, THEY COULD FILL IN  THEIR INFORMATION. ^^ THIS COULD BE SOMEBODY WHO  LOST THE I.D., LOST IN THE MAIL, THEY WANT TO FILL OUT.  ^^ OR IF THEY WERE AT A PARTNERSHIP EVENT AND MAY NOT  HAVE THE I.D., THEY CAN USE THIS OPTION.  WE ASK WHAT STATE THEY WILL BE LIVING IN.  THIS IS BECAUSE WE DO HAVE SEPARATE PATHING FOR PUERTO  RICO, BECAUSE PUERTO RICO HAS VERY DIFFERENT STYLE OF ADDRESS  TYPES THAN WE DO. I'M GOING TO GO THE U.S. ROUTE. THIS IS WHAT WE ANTICIPATE MOST  RESPONDENTS PROVIDING THEIR ADDRESS.  WE CONSIDER THIS CITY STYLE ADDRESS.  ADDRESS NUMBER, STREET NAME, APARTMENT OR UNIT, IF  APPLICABLE, CITY, STATE, ZIP CODE.  THIS IS ALSO REQUIRED FIELD, SO TO COMPLETE YOUR CENSUS VIA  NON-I.D. ROUTE YOU MUST PROVIDE A COMPLETE ADDRESS.  ^^ CAN I ASK YOU TO CLICK ON I DO NOT HAVE A STREET ADDRESS,  THAT'S TRUE FOR A LARGE NONE OF PEOPLE.  ^^ YES. ^^ A NON-I.D. PERSON WHO DOES  NOT HAVE A STREET ADDRESS, CAN THEY -- CAN SOMEONE HOMELESS  FILL THIS OUT AT A LIBRARY, ON THEIR OWN, ON THE INTERNET?  ^^ YES. WHAT WOULD THEY USE?  ^^ THAT'S WHERE WE'RE ARE NOW. I'M GETTING AHEAD OF YOU.  ^^ WE ASK IF THEY HAVE A RURAL ROUTE ADDRESS.  I'LL SAY NO SINCE YOU FOLKS ARE INTERESTED IN THE OTHER OPTION.  IT'S STANDARD RURAL ROUTE ADDRESS FIELD THAT WE COLLECT. THEN WE ASK WILL YOU BE  EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ON APRIL 1, 2020.  ^^ IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION PRESS STAR-1.  ONE MOMENT. ^^ SO IF IT WERE AFTER SEVEN CENSUS DAY WERE YOU  EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ON APRIL 1, AND THAT'S TRUE FOR  ALL THE QUESTIONS. SO THIS WOULD BE THE SORT OF  LAST EFFORT TO COLLECT ADDRESS INFORMATION, AND THE ONLY THING  WE REQUIRE IS CITY, STATE, ZIP CODE, SOME ADDITIONAL  INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE THE PERSON WAS LIVING.  ^^ I WANT TO ASK, THE EXAMPLE WE HAVE COMING FROM INDIAN  COUNTRY ALL THE TIME IS SOMEONE MAY SAY I'M THE HOUSE LIKE TWO  MILES PAST INTERSECTION OF BI ROAD, 124, 456, THEY DON'T HAVE  A STREET ADDRESS. THAT'S WHERE THEY WOULD SIMPLY  ENTER NARRATIVE TO EXPLAIN GEOGRAPHICALLY LOU -- HOW TO  STOP? ^^ IT'S 11:00.  WE HAVE TO STOP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT BUT WE'LL COME BACK TO  JIM'S QUESTION. ^^ THANK YOU, JULIE.  IT'S 11 A.M. NOW TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENT.  WE TAKE PUN COMMENTS IN WRITING, IN PERSON, BY PHONE.  IN-PERSON COMMENTS ARE LIMITED TO TWO MINUTES. ^^ PRESS  STAR-1 TO ASK A QUESTION OR MAKE A COMMENT.  ^^ IF YOU'RE FOLLOWING VIRTUALLY AND WOULD LIKE TO  MAKE A COMMENT DIAL 1-800-857-9723. PASS CODE IS 274-6040.  I WILL REQUEST COMMENTS FROM THE PHONE LINES LAST TO GIVE  YOU TIME TO DIAL IN. WE RECEIVED SIX WRITTEN PUBLIC  COMMENTS, WHICH ARE NOW POSTED ON THE NAC MEETING PAGE ON  CENSUS.GOV. WE RECEIVED PUBLIC COMMENTS  FROM SUSAN GRAHAM WHO IS THE PRESIDENT AND EXECUTIVE  DIRECTOR OF PROJECT RACE. FROM DEBRA STEIN, NETWORK  DIRECTOR FOR PARTNERSHIP FOR AMERICA'S CHILDREN.  FROM KIM KEATING, SENIOR POLICY RESEARCH ANALYST AT ZERO TO  THREE. ALSO RECEIVED COMMENTS FROM  KURT DECKER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL DISABILITY  RIGHTS NETWORK. ALSO FROM DEBRA WEINSTEIN,  EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF COALITION ON HUMAN NEEDS.  AND ALSO FROM KARA BALLOTERI, HAVE THE WITH FIRST FOCUS ON  CHILDREN. KARA BALDERRI.  DO WE HAVE ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT IN THE  ROOM? IF SO PLEASE PROCEED TO THE  TABLE, LABELED PUBLIC COMMENT. BEFORE MAKING YOUR COMMENT,  PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION CLEARLY.  TURN ON YOUR MICROPHONE AND STATE YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION.  ^^ (INDISCERNIBLE) I WANT TO MENTION THAT I SIGNED UP, I  DON'T KNOW WHY YOU DIDN'T MENTION, AND WHY YOUR COMMENT  TIME IS SO SHORT, DISADVANTAGE TO OUR CITIZENS.  I THINK YOU SHOULD CORRECT ALL THOSE ERROR OR UNJUSTICE  PRACTICE. NOW, FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO SAY  IS OUR SYSTEM IS SO BAD, AND IT'S BASICALLY IS THAT WHAT I CALL ROBBERRISM,  BASICALLY CONDUCT, GOVERNMENT GAIN, MURDER, CRIME, INJUST  NETWORK OPERATION. ^^ PRESS STAR-1 IF YOU'D LIKE  TO ASK A QUESTION. ^^ MAYBE IN THIS REGARD SAME  THING IF YOU CONSIDER WORK WITH GOVERNMENT, BASICALLY REALLY EXTENSION OF ROBBERRISM, CITIZEN IN THE SYSTEM WIDE BUT ALSO ROB THE GOVERNMENT,  TAXPAYERS MONEY, SO THEY RAISE A LOT OF DEBT.  THAT'S A PROBLEM. WHEN I TRY TO GIVE EXAMPLE,  ROBBER CITY, TOWN CENTER, THE OTHER ONE I WANT TO MENTION IS  NATION ACADEMY OF SCIENCE ENGINEERING AND MEDICINE, THEN  FURTHER IN DEFENSE DEPARTMENT, REASON CONFERENCE IN C-4 R-NET,  PLUS THE DEFENSE THAT COME, DEFENSE NEEDS TO COME.  THIS IS ALL OPERATION LIKE ROBBERRISM.  THEY USE AND MISUSE POLICE TO PROTECT THEM AND THEY SEND  PEOPLE TO JAIL IF YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THEM.  AND SO IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY NATION ACADEMY OF SCIENCE WE  THINK WHAT IS DISTINGUISHED ORGANIZATION BY SCIENTISTS BUT  IT'S NOT RIGHT THE WAY YOU THINK THAT WAY, AND THIS CENSUS  BUREAU THEY USE THEM AS EXAMPLE, THIS BUREAU --  ^^ I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT. WE'VE MET THE TWO-MINUTE MARK.  ^^ I WANT TO KNOW WHY -- ^^ I INVITE YOU TO SUBMIT THE  REST OF YOUR COMMENTS IN WRITING.  ^^ COMMENT IS NOT IN THE REGULATION.  ^^ TWO MINUTES HAVE EXPIRED. I'M VERY STORY.   SORRY. I INVITE YOU TO SUBMIT THE REST  OF YOUR COMMENTS IN WRITING. ^^ I SUBMIT MANY COMMENTS  BEFORE BUT NO RESPONSE, BASICALLY GOVERNMENT IS DEBT.  ^^ THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENT. DO WE HAVE ANYONE ELSE IN THE  ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A PUBLIC COMMENT?  COMMENTS ARE LIMITED TO TWO MINUTES.  ARE THERE ANY PUBLIC COMMENTERS ON THE PHONE?  ^^ THERE ARE NO AUDIO QUESTIONS.  ^^ OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  WE WILL NOW PROCEED BACK TO OUR SESSION.  ^^ LET'S GO BACK I BELIEVE JIM HAD JUST ASKED THE QUESTION  REMIND ME WHAT IT WAS. WHAT THE ANSWER WAS.  OKAY. ^^ JUST TO REMIND YOU, THE  QUESTION WAS CAN SOMEONE BASICALLY WRITE A NARRATIVE  EXPLAINING HOW TO GET TO THEIR HOME IF THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY  STREET ADDRESS, ANY SORT OF TRADITIONAL ADDRESS.  ^^ YES, THEY CAN. ^^ JULIE, CAN I ASK A QUESTION  TOO? ^^ YES.  ^^ YOU MAY NOT BE RIGHT PERSON TO ANSWER THIS, BUT WITH THE  WRITE-IN INFORMATION AT THE BOTTOM ABOUT THE NAME OF THE  PARK, ET CETERA, DOES THE CENSUS BUREAU USE THAT  INFORMATION FOR DEDUPLICATION LATER AND HOW -- SO IN MY  EXPERIENCE IN PLACES WHERE I STAYED REGULARLY WHEN I WAS  EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THERE WERE LOTS OF OTHER FOLKS  STAYING IN THAT PLACE TOO. WE MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE A LOT OF  THINGS IN COMMON THAT MIGHT MAKE US LOOK LIKE DUPLICATES. HOW DOES THAT WORK?  ^^ SO, I'LL JUMP IN HERE. YOU DID A NICE JOB, KRISTIN.  SO, IN TERMS OF YOU'RE PUTTING YOUR INFORMATION IN, YOU'RE  EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND YOU'RE HERE, SO YOU'RE COMING  THROUGH NON-I.D., QUICK TUTORIAL ON OUR NON-I.D.  PROCESS, YOU GUYS PROBABLY HEARD US TALK ABOUT REALTIME  MATCHING THAT WE DO, WHERE WE CAN MARRY UP YOUR I.D. IN  ADVANCE. THAT OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T HAPPEN  HERE. WE HAVE A STAFF AT OUR NATIONAL  PROCESSING CENTER THAT REVIEWS THAT.  THIS RESPONSE WILL TRY TO TAG TO THE CLOSEST SERVICE BASED  ENUMERATION LOCATION, TO YOUR WRITE-IN THAT YOU PUT RIGHT  THERE. AND THEN WE HANDLE AND DON'T  ALWAYS GET INTO A LOT OF DETAILS IN THIS IN PUBLIC  MEETINGS AS WE ALWAYS HAVE DEDUPLICATION DOWNSTREAM, SO I  THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE.  I KNOW YOU'RE A GREAT MESSENGER FOR US, MEGHAN, PERSONALLY, TO  HAVE PEOPLE FILL THIS OUT AS WITH AS MUCH DETAIL AS  POSSIBLE, TO HELP OUT THE CENSUS BUREAU, BUT THEN AGAIN  WHEN YOU'RE WORKING WITH PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES  EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS REMEMBER THAT OUR SERVICE-BASED  ENUMERATION OPERATIONS THAT HAPPEN OVER THAT THREE-DAY  PERIOD IS WHERE WE'RE ALSO LOOKING TO COLLECT INFORMATION  AT THOSE LOCATIONS. SO IF YOU GUYS CAN HELP US GET  THAT MESSAGE OUT, I THINK THAT WILL BE HELPFUL.  BUT WHEN YOU HAVE WRITE-IN IN BOX ON THIS, KRISTIN WILL  PROBABLY KILL ME, IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO PUT AS MUCH INFORMATION  IN THERE AND NOT ERR ON THE SIDE OF, WELL, I'LL PUT A FEW  THINGS. SO ENCOURAGING THAT BUT GOOD  QUESTION. AS MUCH EXPLANATION AS POSSIBLE  SO WE KNOW -- ^^ I APPRECIATE THAT.  ^^ WE CAN DIFFERENTIATE MEGHAN FROM SOMEONE WHO IS IN THE SAME  PLACE, ET CETERA. I THINK THAT WAS YOUR QUESTION.  ^^ TOTALLY. I THINK THAT GOES TO SOME  FEEDBACK WE'RE HEARING A LOT FROM FOLKS WHICH IS  SERVICE-BASED YOUR NUMERATION IS A GREAT OPERATION, I THINK  I'VE SAID BEFORE IT COULD USE SOME HELP, I'D LOVE TO HELP  WITH THAT AS YOU'RE BUILDING TOWARD 2030.  AND IN 2020 WE KNOW THERE ARE CITIES RIGHT NOW WHERE THERE  ARE -- I THINK THE CITY OF L.A. HAS MORE THAN 48,000 PEOPLE  EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS RIGHT NOW AND WE'RE TRYING TO CAPTURE  THEM IN A THREE-DAY PERIOD, AND WHEN THERE ARE CITIES WITH THAT  VOLUME OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS, THEY ARE NOT  ALWAYS GOING TO BE CAPTURED THROUGH THE PROCESSES, SO WE'RE  TRYING TO MAKE SURE ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE CITIES BUT ALSO FOR THE AT SO -- ADVOCATES.  SO THANK YOU, WE'LL DO OUR BEST TO SPREAD THAT MESSAGE AS  WIDELY AS WE CAN. APPRECIATE IT.  ^^ OKAY. ARE WE ABLE TO GET -- THERE WAS  AN ISSUE WITH PUBLIC COMMENTS. WE HAD TWO PEOPLE ONLINE, WHO  HAVE WRITTEN THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO UNMUTE.  ARE WE AT A PLACE TO RETURN TO THOSE PEOPLE ON THE CALL OR NOT  YET? WE'LL CONTINUE.  PLEASE STAY ON THE LINE, IF YOU ARE ON THE LINE, WE'LL GET TO  YOUR PUBLIC COMMENT. MEANTIME LET'S CONTINUE WITH  OUR QUESTIONS. I THINK SETH OR JERI WAS --  THIS ONE OR THE OTHER ONE OR BOTH?  WE WENT ON WITHOUT YOU, JERI AND SETH. ^^ THE PREVIOUS ONE. GOOD TO SEE YOU OUT THERE SPREADING THE GOSPEL.  WITH RESPECT TO CRM DID I HEAR YOU SAY PARTNERS HAVE ACCESS?  ^^ THIS IS INTERNAL PARTNERSHIP STAFF. ^^ THAT'S WHAT I  THOUGHT. SO THEN THE OTHER QUESTION HAS  TO DO WITH HOW YOU HANDLED NATIONAL AND REGIONAL INPUTS.  THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN, YOU KNOW, A LITTLE TRICKY.  ^^ YEP. ^^ WHEN THE REGIONAL FOLKS ARE  PUTTING IN INFORMATION, NATIONAL PEOPLE ARE PUTTING IN  INFORMATION DOES CRM ACCOMMODATE THE DISAGGREGATION  SO YOU HAVE A GOOD COUNT AND ESPECIALLY WHEN I THINK IT'S  TRICKY WHEN REGIONAL PARTNERS ARE DOING NATIONAL  PARTNERSHIPS, YOU KNOW THAT. AND SO CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT  A LITTLE BIT? ^^ I WILL TALK FROM A  TECHNOLOGY PERSPECTIVE AND WELCOME TIM AND OTHERS FROM  FIELD FROM THEIR POLICIES AND HOW THEY MANAGE.  CRM TOOL HAS BEEN BUILT FOR BOTH NATIONAL PARTNERSHIP STAFF  AND LOCAL PARTNERSHIP STAFF, WE DO HAVE A VERY ROBUST  DEDUPLICATION PROCESS. SO, I WILL USE EXAMPLE, IF I AM  A NATIONAL PARTNERSHIP WORKING WITH WALMART AS JUST AN  EXAMPLE, AND THERE ARE MANY LOCAL STORES THAT MAY ALSO BE  WORKING WITH LOCAL PARTNERSHIP STAFF FROM A WALMART  PERSPECTIVE, I WILL SEE DUPLICATION IN THAT EFFORT.  I WILL SEE FROM THE DUPLICATION SCREEN THERE'S ANOTHER  PARTNERSHIP SPECIALIST OR NATIONAL PARTNERSHIP STAFF  MEMBER WHO IS ALSO WORKING WITH THAT PARTNER.  IN THE CASE WHERE THERE IS DUPLICATION, THEY HAVE THE  OPPORTUNITY TO SEE WHO IS THE LOCAL PARTNERSHIP STAFF OR  NATIONAL PARTNERSHIP MEMBER WORKING WITH THE ORGANIZATION  AND THEY CAN WORK TOGETHER IN EFFORT, IF THEY ARE WORKING IN  DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIES OR HAVE THE SAME CONTACT, THERE'S THE  EFFORT TO SEE THAT. THAT IS ONE OF THE MAJOR  OPPORTUNITIES. WHEN IT COMES TO AS EXAMPLE OF  A CROSS--- I'LL TAKE A LOCAL GOVERNMENT AS EXAMPLE.  ^^ AS A REMINDER, IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION ON THE  PHONE, PLEASE PRESS STAR-1. THANK YOU.  ^^ INVOLVED IN A MULTIPLE CENSUS BUREAU STAFF INVOLVED IN  REACHING OUT TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.  THEY CAN SEE THOSE DETAILS AND WORK TOGETHER TO CONTACT THEM.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE DO SEPARATE NATIONAL PARTNERSHIP  AND LOCAL PARTNERSHIP, THERE IS THAT ABILITY CLEARLY LAID OUT  IN CRM. ^^ CONGRESSIONAL PARTNERSHIPS  AS WELL, WHERE DOES THAT FALL INTO IT?  ^^ CONGRESSIONAL PARTNERSHIP IS ALSO INCLUDED.  THAT'S ONE OF THE TYPES OF PARTNERS WE HAVE.  WE'RE EXCITED PARTNERSHIP STAFF AND OFFICE OF CONGRESSIONAL  AFFAIRS IS WORKING AND CLEARLY LABELING THE SUPPORT WE HAVE  FROM THE HILL FROM PARTNERSHIP PERSPECTIVE.  ^^ FINALLY, I KNOW THIS USED TO BE A PROBLEM, I'M DATING MYSELF  A BIT. THAT WAS ONLY A FEW YEARS AGO,  TIM. BUT CAN ONE -- LIKE IF REGIONS  ARE DOING SOMETHING ON NATIONAL LEVEL CAN IT OVERRIDE WHAT  FOLKS HERE AT HEADQUARTERS THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH THE  INFORMATION BEING OVERRIDDEN, WHICH WOULD KIND OF DIMINISH  THE NUMBER OF PARTNERS. ^^ I WILL SPEAK TO TECHNOLOGY.  TECHNOLOGY NEVER DELETES. WE'RE ALWAYS TRACKING THE  INFORMATION. IF THERE IS SOMEONE WHO IS  PUSHING THROUGH THE DEDUPLICATION PROCESS AND  MOVING FORWARD WE'VE WORKED WITH FIELD LEADERSHIP TO MAKE  SURE THERE'S A REVIEW OF THE PROCESS, AT NO TIME WILL THE  SYSTEM DELETE OR OVERRIDE INFORMATION PROVIDED, BUT TIM,  IF YOU HAD ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD.  ^^ SO TIM OLSON. JERI, YOU PROBABLY HAVE SOME OF  THE BEST INSIGHT INTO OUR PAST EXPERIENCE WITH PREVIOUS SILOS  OF NATIONAL PARTNERSHIP GROUPS AND REGIONAL PARTNERSHIP GROUPS  AND HOW DOES IT COME TOGETHER. I HAVE TO SAY, THIS PARTICULAR  CENSUS, PARTICULARLY WITH THE CRM, THOSE SILOS ARE A LOT LESS  OF A PROBLEM, AND IT'S REALLY -- IT'S VERY GRATIFYING TO SEE  WE'VE GOT A TOOL THAT EVERYBODY CAN SEE INSIDE OF, AND TO BE  AWARE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING EITHER AT THE NATIONAL OR THE  LOCAL GROUND LEVEL. AND ALSO TO WORK TOGETHER.  IT'S A DIFFERENT WORLD. AND IT IS GRATIFYING HAVING BEEN THROUGH MULTIPLE CENSUSES  TO SEE OUR NATIONAL TEAM AND OUR REGIONAL TEAMS REALLY INTEGRATED, IN WORKING  TOGETHER. ALL I CAN SAY IS KUDOS TO THE  PEOPLE THAT HAVE MADE THAT HAPPEN, AND WE'LL CONTINUE  MOVING FORWARD. SO IT'S A GOOD NEWS STORY.  ^^ OKAY. LET'S TAKE A QUICK PAUSE HERE  AND CHECK IN WITH OUR PHONE OPERATOR.  ARE WE ABLE TO HEAR PUBLIC COMMENTERS YET?  ^^ WE DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS. FIRST QUESTION COMES FROM  DETIS. YOUR LINE IS OPEN.  ^^ THANK YOU. HELLO, NAC.  I HOPE YOU CAN HEAR ME. ^^ YES, WE CAN.  ^^ SO THANKS FOR FIXING THE LINES.  I MISSED YOU GUYS, I'M HERE IN CALIFORNIA.  I WANT TO SAY MEGHAN DID COVER WHAT WE WERE SAYING.  I WANT TO COMMENT ON ZACK COVERED THE CRM, GREAT  PARTNERSHIP SPECIALISTS ARE RECORDING PARTNERS.  WE'RE HEARING FROM LOCAL COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEES ALL  OVER THE STATE. THEY WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND  WHO THE PARTNERS ARE WORKING WITH TO BE COORDINATED AT THE  TABLE, I WANT TO MAKE SURE I PUT THAT OUT THERE.  NOW, IN TERMS OF HOMELESS COUNT, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TO  WHAT MEGHAN HAD ALLUDED TO, WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE EFFORT  OF THE REGIONAL OPERATION AREA MANAGER, RESPECTFULLY WE NOW  CALIFORNIANS WELL, THAT'S WE'RE INVESTING $180 MILLION TO  OVERCOME MOTIVATIONAL BARRIERS, TRUSTED MESSENGERS, ANNUAL  STRUCTURAL BARRIERS. ONE IS THE THREE-DAY OPERATION,  CREATED TO IMPLEMENT ACROSS THE NATION TO MAKE SURE RETURNING  PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OR WHO ARE HOUSING  UNSTABLE, IT MAY NOT BE WELL SUITED TO MEET TREMENDOUS NEEDS  OF OUR UNHOUSED IN CALIFORNIA. MORE SPECIFICALLY, TO GIVE AN  EXAMPLE, IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. THE UNHOUSED POPULATION IS AT  TIMES SLIGHTLY LESS THAN THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF, SAY,  CHAPEL HILL, NORTH CAROLINA, IF YOU TAKE THE STUDENT POPULATION  OUT OF THAT. IT GIVES PERSPECTIVE HOW LARGE  IT CAN BE. WE'RE CONCERNED HERE IN  CALIFORNIA THAT WITHOUT THE HELP OF LOCAL SERVICE PROVIDERS  AND OTHER CULTURAL GUIDES REGIONAL OPERATIONS WILL NOT  HAVE THE STAFF TO ACCURATELY ENUMERATE OVER 44,000 PEOPLE IN  OUR OUTDOOR LOCATIONS DURING THAT THREE-DAY PERIOD.  WE'RE REQUESTING THE BUREAU CONSIDER DEPUTIZING VOLUNTEERS  THAT NORMALLY WORK WITH THESE FOLKS OUT IN THE FIELD DURING  THE TEMPORARY NONSHELTERED OUTDOOR LOCATION TO ASSIST.  THAT'S ONE COMMENT. I ONLY HAVE TWO MINUTES.  YOU'RE GOING A GREAT JOB. REALLY KEEP UP THE EFFORT.  THE PARTNERS HERE ON THE GROUND, WE HAVE A LOT OF  PARTNERS IN CALIFORNIA AND WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE  CONNECTING WITH OUR PARTNERS, AND THEY'VE GOT FANCY SYSTEM TO  DO IT. WE'RE DOWN HERE ON THE GROUND  IN THE TRENCHES. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  ^^ THANK YOU. I BELIEVE THERE MAY BE ONE MORE  PUBLIC COMMENTER ON THE PHONE, AND PLEASE REMEMBER TO LIMIT  YOUR COMMENTS TO TWO MINUTES. ^^ THANK YOU.  WE HAVE TWO MORE. ARTURO, YOUR LINE IS OPEN.  ^^ THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING, MY FRIENDS.  ARTURO VARGAS ALSO FROM CALIFORNIA CALLING IN.  WANTED TO MAKE SOME REQUESTS OF THE CENSUS BUREAU WITH REGARD  TO PARTNERS UNDERSTANDING HOW THE ONLINE EXPERIENCE IS GOING  TO WORK. I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO  HAVE BETTER DIRECTIONS FOR THE PUBLIC ON HOW TO COMPLETE THE  HISPANIC ORIGIN AND RACE QUESTIONS.  IT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO HAVE DEMONSTRATIONS FOR  PARTNERS ON HOW THE INTERNET SELF-RESPONSE IS GOING TO WORK.  SO THAT MANY ORGANIZATIONS THAT NOW ARE PREPARING TO HELP WITH  GET OUT THE COULDN'T HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO HELP  PEOPLE COMPLETE THE FORM OR AT LEAST TO EXPLAIN WHAT THE  ONLINE EXPERIENCE WOULD LOOK LIKE.  AND IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR FOLKS TO ALSO UNDERSTAND THE  DIFFERENCES THAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCE IN USING THE ISR  VERSUS PAPER FORMS AS RESPONSE MODES.  THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. I'LL KEEP WATCHING YOU ALL ON  THE SCREEN. ^^ THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  AND OPERATOR, OUR FINAL PUBLIC COMMENTER?  ^^ THANK YOU. THE LAST COMMENT COMES FROM  GREG. YOUR LINE IS OPEN.  ^^ THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.  GREGORY WILLIAMSON, PARTNERSHIP SPECIALIST IN THE LOS ANGELES  AREA. I SPECIALIZE IN PARTNERSHIPS  WITH ORGANIZATION ALSO IN THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY, AND I'M  INTERESTED IN THE QUESTION ABOUT SEX WITH POSSIBLE ANSWERS  BEING EITHER MALE OR FEMALE. MY QUESTION IS, IF AN  INDIVIDUAL DOESN'T IDENTIFY WITH ONE OR THE OTHER, ARE THEY  ABLE TO CONTINUE THE QUESTIONNAIRE ONLINE WITHOUT  ANSWERING THAT QUESTION OR IS AN ANSWER REQUIRED THERE BEFORE  BEING ABLE TO PROCEED? AND IF A RESPONSE IS NOT  REQUIRED, WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE IS A NONRESPONSE TO THAT  QUESTION, WITH REGARD TO USE OF ADMINISTRATIVE DATA?  THANK YOU. ^^ IS THAT THE END OF OUR  PUBLIC COMMENTS, OPERATOR? ^^ THAT CONCLUDES THE COMMENTS.  ^^ GREAT. THANKS SO MUCH.  OUR PUBLIC COMMENTERS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO ASK QUESTIONS, I'D  LIKE TO ENTER THAT AS A QUESTION FOR OUR FOLKS, I WAS  WONDERING, MALE OR FEMALE, I HAVE MANY STUDENTS NONBINARY IN  MY CLASSES NOW. YOU KNOW, AND SO PERSONS WHO  MIGHT USE THEY/THEM, DON'T IDENTIFY AS MAN OR WOMAN, WHAT  HAPPENS IF SOMEONE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, GREG, FOR THE PUBLIC  COMMENT, WHAT HAPPENS IF SOMEONE DOES NOT INDICATE MALE  OR FEMALE, CAN THEY STILL PROCEED?  IS THERE ANY WAY IN WHICH SOMEONE CAN INDICATE SOMETHING LIKE THAT?  ^^ THE QUICK ANSWER IS YES, THEY CAN STILL PROCEED.  SO THEY WILL JUST GO, GET THE SAME SORT OF THING YOU WOULD  GET IF YOU DIDN'T ANSWER ANY QUESTION, YOU GOT A BLUE BOX AT  THE TOP AND CLICK FORWARD TO CONTINUE.  ^^ THEY WOULD HAVE MISSING DATA FOR GENDER? ON THE SAME TOPIC?  I'LL HAVE MEGHAN SPEAK ON THE SAME TOPIC AND THEN SETH.  ^^ JUST TO ENTER THE SECOND PART OF THAT QUESTION INTO THE  RECORD, IF THERE'S MISSING DATA FOR THAT QUESTION, OR FOR ANY  OTHER QUESTION, IS THAT THEN IMPUTED FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL,  LIKE DOES THE CENSUS BUREAU THEN KIND OF DECIDE YOUR GENDER FOR YOU?  ^^ I'M MATT SPENCE, POPULATION DIVISION.  YES, IF ANY SELF-IDENTIFICATION QUESTION IS MISSING, SUCH AS  SEX, IT WOULD BE IMPUTED USING NORMAL EDIT IMPUTATION  PROCEDURES. ^^ THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  SETH? ^^ NOW I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS.  IS IT RECORDED WHEN THINGS ARE EDITED?  IS IT RECORDED, WHEN THE DATA IS RELEASED, IF YOU IMPUTED  SOMETHING YOU RECORD THAT IT'S BEEN IMPUTED, RIGHT?  ^^ YES. SO, IF IT'S IMPUTED, IT'S  RECORDED IN OUR INTERNAL SYSTEM THAT IT'S BEEN FLAGGED AS  IMPUTED. RATHER THAN AS REPORTED.  ^^ WE CAN TALK ABOUT PUBLIC DATA PRODUCTS LATER.  I THINK I WOULD LIKE CLARIFICATION ON WHAT HAPPENS  IF SOMEONE ENTERS AN ADDRESS, I'M SPECIFICALLY THINKING ABOUT  LIKE LARGE APARTMENT BUILDINGS WHERE SOMEONE DOESN'T PUT AN  APARTMENT IN, AND THEN THE NAME DOESN'T MATCH.  AND SO YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHICH YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOUR  DATA BASE IS BAD, AND SOMEONE WAS LEGITIMATELY AT THAT  ADDRESS, OR IF SOMEONE'S NOT LEGITIMATELY AT THAT ADDRESS,  HOW DO YOU RESOLVE THAT? ^^ OKAY, SO I THINK THIS IS THE  QUESTION YOU'RE ASKING. IT WOULD BE ABOUT A NON-I.D.  RESPONSE THAT COULDN'T ACTUALLY GET -- WE COULDN'T VALIDATE  THROUGH REAL TIME OR OUR MPC CLERICAL OPERATION, WE CALL  THAT FIELD VERIFICATION, AND WE WILL SEND THAT CASE TO THE  FIELD. ^^ I GUESS WHAT I'M WORRIED  ABOUT IS THE TIME LAG, IN THAT CASE.  YOU KNOW, HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO VERIFY, IF SOMEONE FILLS OUT  THE INTERNET FORM, I'LL MAKE UP DATES, ON MARCH, I DON'T KNOW WHEN.  ^^ MARCH 12. ^^ AND YOU COME ON MARCH 19,  THE PERSON IS NOT THERE, AS LONG AS IT'S BEFORE YOU'RE OKAY  BUT WHAT IF IT'S AFTER? WHAT IF IT'S AFTER APRIL 1,  24E7B WHAT DO YOU DO? ^^ WE'LL STILL DO THAT WORK.  WE'RE VALIDATING IF WE'RE GETTING A RESPONSE, NON-I.D.,  WE HAVE AN ADDRESS WE'RE TRYING TO EITHER MAP TO AN I.D. THAT  WE HAVE OR IT COULD BE SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE  ADDED, WE RUN FIELD VERIFICATION THROUGH THE END OF  NONRESPONSE FOLLOW-UP. ^^ I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER ABOUT  THIS. ^^ OKAY.  WHEN WE GO FOR BREAK. ^^ OKAY.  THANK YOU, EVERYONE. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A VERY  SHORT FIVE-MINUTE BREAK AND RECONVENE AT 11:30.  [ RECESS ] .  ^^ WE'RE ABOUT TO GET STARTED. NAC MEMBERS, TAKE YOUR FOOD TO  IS YOUR SEATS. SOME MOTION IN THE -- SOME  FOLKS IN THE HALL, COME ON IN, IF YOU CAN HEAR ME.  WE'RE GOING TO GET STARTED IN EXACTLY ONE MINUTE.  ALL RIGHT.  LET'S TURN TO OUR NEXT PRESENTATION.  WE'RE GOING TO HAVE AN UPDATE ON CONFIDENTIALITY AND DISCLOSURE  AVOIDANCANCE FROM JENNY HUNTER CHILDS AND JOHN ABOWD.  EVERYONE.  THIS PRESENTATION IS GOING TO START WITH A VIDEO THAT THE  CENSUS BUREAU COLLABORATED ON PRODUCTION OF.  I THINK MANY OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE NOT BACK YET, WE  SHOULD PROBABLY START PLAYING THE VIDEO. [ NO AUDIO ] [ NO AUDIO ]  EXPERIENCING TECHNICAL  DIFFICULTY. I DON'T WANT TO INFLICT JENNY  DOING THE PRESENTATION WITHOUT SLIDES SHE HAS THE FIRST HALF,  SO WHY DON'T YOU START, YOUR SLIDES WILL COME UP AS SOON AS  THEY ARE AVAILABLE. THANK YOU.  ^^ SURE, NO PROBLEM. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME TODAY.  I'M JENNY HUNTER CHILDS, ASSISTANT CHIEF FOR EMERGING  METHODS AND APPLICATIONS IN CENTER FOR BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE  METHODS IN RESEARCH DIRECTORATE.  WE HAVE BEEN DOING RESEARCH WITH THE GUIDANCE OF JOHN ABOWD  ON RESPONDENTS' UNDERSTANDING OF REIDENTIFICATION RISKS, SO  THE TYPES OF RISKS THAT THE DISCLOSURE AVOIDANCE TECHNIQUES  ARE AIMED AT PROTECTING AGAINST, THE TYPES OF THINGS  WE'VE BEEN TALKING WITH RESPONDENTS ABOUT TRYING TO  GAIN UNDERSTANDING, BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN IN A WAY RESPONDENTS  CAN UNDERSTAND. AND TO BE ABLE TO MEASURE THEIR  CONCERN ABOUT DISCLOSURE. THIS HAS BEEN ABOUT A TWO-YEAR  -- MOSTLY QUALITATIVE RESEARCH PROJECT, WHERE WE TALK WITH  RESPONDENTS ABOUT RISKS OF DATA BREACHES AND REIDENTIFICATION  AND DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE THINGS, AND WE'VE COME UP WITH  A QUESTIONNAIRE COGNITIVELY TESTED THROUGH MULTIPLE ROUNDS  TO UNDERSTAND HOW A RESPONDENT FEELS ABOUT RISKS OF  CONFIDENTIALITY BREACH BY WAY OF REIDENTIFICATION.  THAT WAS THE GOAL OF OUR RESEARCH STUDY.  WHAT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU AS SOON AS THE SLIDES COME UP IS A  LITTLE BIT OF FINDINGS FROM -- WE SPENT SEVERAL ROUNDS  QUALITATIVELY TESTING QUESTIONNAIRE.  ^^ WE HAVE THE SLIDES ON OUR iPAD, IF YOU TELL US THE  NUMBER. ^^ OKAY.  THAT'S GOOD. LET ME GET MY SLIDES.  I WAS LOOKING AT SOMETHING ELSE.  FIRST SLIDE WAS 46.  ^^ OKAY. I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THEM SO I  KNOW WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT. THANK YOU. OKAY.  THANK YOU. OKAY.  SO, A RESEARCH QUESTIONS, RESPONDENTS WORRIED ABOUT  REIDENTIFICATION, RESPONDENTS PREFER MORE PRIVACY AT THE COST  OF LESS ACCURACY. I DON'T HAVE TO READ THEM.  WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW RESPONDENTS PERCEIVE THESE  THINGS. GENERAL PUBLIC AND RESPONDENTS.  IT'S BEEN A TASK TO GET RESPONDENTS TO UNDERSTAND  BECAUSE THEY ARE COMPLEX, COMPLEX CONCEPTS.  METHOD SLIDES, IN-PERSON COGNITIVE TESTING, TWO ROUNDS  OF RESPONDENTS, AND THEN WE DID AN ONLINE PRE-TEST WHERE --  THIS IS THE RESULTS. PROOF OF CONCEPT FIELD TEST  THIS PAST SUMMER WITH ONLINE INSTRUMENT, WHAT WE DID WAS HAD  RESPONDENTS FILL OUT A MOCK CENSUS QUESTION QUESTIONNAIRE  AND WE ASKED THEM QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR PRIVACY AND ASKED  QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PRIVACY ACCURACY TRADEOFF THAT WE'VE  BEEN TALKING ABOUT WITH REGARD TO DISCLOSURE AVOIDANCE.  WE HAD A RANDOMIZED NATIONAL SAMPLE OF 20,000 HOUSEHOLDS  SELECTED FROM OUR INTERNAL MASTER ADDRESS FILE AND CONTACT  FRAME. WE GOT A PRETTY LOW RESPONSE  RATE AS IS TYPICAL FOR COLD CONTACT, 727 RESPONSES, AND WE  DID WEB PROBING, LOOKING AT RESPONDENT UNDERSTANDING WHILE  DOING THIS PILOT TEST. AND OUR GOAL FOR THIS FALL,  THIS WINTER, TO CONDUCT A LARGE NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE  SAMPLE SURVEY. SO DATA I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU  ARE FROM A NOT REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE.  THE SAMPLE THAT WE HAVE IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE  POPULATION BUT YOU CAN GET AN IDEA FOR THE TYPES OF THINGS  THAT WE'RE SEEING WITH THIS POPULATION.  THE NEXT SLIDE SHOWS LEVEL OF CONCERN ABOUT CONFIDENTIALITY  OF CENSUS INFORMATION, WE ASKED PEOPLE HOW CONCERNED THEY WOULD  BE IF THEIR OWN AGE WAS DISCLOSED.  WE HAD THEM TAKE THE CENSUS QUESTIONNAIRE AND SAID WE WOULD  ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE THEY HAD.  WHAT WOULD THEY FEEL IF THEIR AGE WAS DISCLOSED ON THE THE  CENSUS FORM. YOU CAN SEE HERE THE MODERATELY  AND VERY, A LITTLE OVER -- LESS THAN 20% MODERATELY OR VERY  CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR OWN AGE GETTING OUT, MORE ABOUT OTHERS'  AGE. YOU CAN SEE INFORMATION ABOUT  RACE. THIS IS YOUR OWN RACE, OTHERS'  RACE IN YOUR HOUSEHOLD, NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE HOUSEHOLD,  RELATIONSHIP TO PERSON ONE, HOMEOWNERSHIP, FULL NAME,  OTHER'S NAME, INFORMATION ON THE CENSUS FORM COMBINED.  THE DIFFERENCE IN THE INFORMATION, AS A CONTROL WE  PUT INCOME AND SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER TO SEE HOW CONCERNED  WOULD A PERSON BE. ALMOST EVERYONE IS CONCERNED IF  YOU FIND OUT THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY.  THAT GIVES A BASIS, THAT'S THE MAXIMUM LEVEL OF CONCERN, AND  WE CAN SEE FROM THERE THE LEVEL OF CONCERN IN THE GENERAL  POPULATION. THIS IS COLLAPSED ACROSS THE  DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS. WHEN WE HAVE OUR FULL STUDY, WE  HOPE TO LOOK AT THE DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS INDIVIDUALLY.  NEXT SLIDE, ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE ASKED ABOUT THE PRIVACY ACCURACY TRADEOFF,  ATTEMPTS TO DISCUSS AND ELICIT RESPONSE FROM RESPONDENT.  POLICYMAKERS, BUSINESSES, RESEARCH, USED INFORMATION TO  MAKE IMPORTANT DECISIONS, MORE DETAILED THE DATA PROVIDED BY  HOUSEHOLDS LIKE YOURS THE MORE USEFUL THE INFORMATION IS.  THIS MITT MEAN REPORTING DATA BY ZIP CODE INSTEAD OF STATE.  BY PROVIDING MORE DETAIL MAY INCREASE RISK AN INDIVIDUAL'S  HOUSEHOLD INFORMATION WOULD BE IDENTIFIED EVEN IF THE RISK IS  LOW. IN GENERAL HOW WELL ARE YOU TO  RISK YOUR CONFIDENTIALITY SO THE GOVERNMENT CAN PRODUCE  USEFUL DATA AND STATICS. YOU CAN SEE HERE 31% OF  RESPONDENTS SAID THEY WERE NOT AT ALL WILLING, 24% SLIGHTLY  WILLING, AND THEN ABOUT 40% SAYING SOMEWHAT WILLING,  MODERATELY WILLING, VERY WILLING. WE CAN MOVE TO THE NEXT SLIDE  WHILE WE'RE GETTING THAT. THE NEXT QUESTION WAS JUST A  SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT VERSION OF THE SAME SORT OF QUESTION,  WILLINGNESS TO SHARE INFORMATION, WE ASKED  RESPONDENTS WHICH STATEMENT THEY MOST AGREED WITH, WERE  THEY WILLING TO SHARE INFORMATION FOR USEFUL  STATISTICS, THEY WOULD RATHER KEEP INFORMATION PRIVATE.  WE HAD -- BASED ON COGNITIVE TESTING, WE HAD THE NUMBER OF  PEOPLE SAID THEY WANTED TO AGREE WITH BOTH, NOT TO AGREE  WITH EITHER, THESE WERE ALLOWED IN THE ONLINE INSTRUMENT.  THOSE INDICATE TO ME JUST A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE  TRADEOFF WE'RE ASKING A PERSON TO MAKE.  YOU CAN SEE ABOUT A THIRD OF PEOPLE WERE WILLING TO SHARE  INFORMATION FOR USEFUL STATISTICS, ABOUT A THIRD  ROUGHLY WOULD RATHER KEEP THE INFORMATION PRIVATE.  THERE'S A THIRD OR SO A LITTLE MORE THAN A THIRD IN BETWEEN  THERE. OKAY.  THERE WE GO. OKAY.  SO, WE TALKED ABOUT OUR JOURNEY TO  TELL RESPONDENTS ABOUT RISK AND MEASURE CONCERN OF RISK FOR  REIDENTIFICATION. WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN  EXPLAINING THE PROBLEM OF REIDENTIFICATION TO  RESPONDENTS, THAT TERM IS NOT SOMETHING RESPONDENTS ARE USED  TO HEARING, THEY MIGHT THINK OF IDENTITY THEFT THAT'S  DIFFERENT. BUT WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN  DESCRIBING THE PROBLEM OF REIDENTIFICATION TO  RESPONDENTSES. ONE MORE ROUND TO REFINED  QUESTION ABOUT REIDENTIFICATION AND THE NEXT STEP IS TO GATHER  THE SAME DATA WITH THE REFINED QUESTION ON LARGER MORE  REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE AND RESULTS OF THIS WILL INFORM THE  2020 DISCLOSURE AVOIDANCE SYSTEM.  THAT'S ALL I HAVE.  WHY DON'T YOU STAY THERE  BECAUSE WE'LL HAVE QUESTIONS AFTERWARDS.  WE'LL TRY THE VIDEO AGAIN.  COUNT EVERY PERSON LIVING IN  THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, COLLECT INFORMATION  ABOUT THEM LIKE AGE, SEX, RACE, ETHNICITY.  THE PURPOSE OF DOING THIS IS TO BE ABLE TO GET OVERALL  QUANTITATIVE PICTURE OF A POPULATION.  HOW MANY PEOPLE LIVE IN MINNESOTA, OR MISSISSIPPI?  WHAT'S THE AVERAGE AGE? HOW DO THESE THINGS DIFFER IN  DIFFERENT PLACES OR BY SEX OR RACE?  RESULTS OF THE U.S. CENSUS ARE OF PARTICULAR POLITICAL  RELEVANCE, USED TO DETERMINE NUMBER OF SEATS STATES GET IN  THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.  AS WELL AS BOUNDARIES OF LEGISLATIVE DISTRICTS FROM  CONGRESS DOWN TO CITY COUNCILS. BIG SURVEYS ARE ALSO USEFUL FOR  UNDERSTANDING LOTS OF OTHER ISSUES TOO.  THE PROBLEM IS THE CENSUS LIKE MANY OTHER MEDICAL AND  DEMOGRAPHIC STUDIES IS SUPPOSED TO BE PRIVATE, NO ONE OUTSIDE  THE CENSUS BUREAU IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT JUST THE  PUBLISHED STATISTICS ABOUT U.S. POPULATION, AND FIGURE OUT  THERE'S A WHITE MARRIED MALE 31-YEAR-OLD WITH NO KIDS LIVING  IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD. THAT'S ME.  THE CENSUS BUREAU IS SUPPOSED TO KEEP MY INFORMATION  CONFIDENTIAL, AND THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO KEEP THE  INFORMATION OF EVERY SINGLE OTHER PERSON LIVING IN THE  UNITED STATES CONFIDENTIAL TOO. WHICH IS A TALL ORDER BECAUSE  HOW CAN YOU KEEP EVERYONE'S INFORMATION ENTIRELY  CONFIDENTIAL WHILE STILL SAYING ANYTHING AT ALL BASED ON THAT  INFORMATION? SHORT ANSWER, YOU CAN'T.  THERE'S AN INHERENT TRADEOFF BETWEEN PUBLISHING SOMETHING  YOU LEARN FROM A SURVEY AND MAINTAINING PRIVACY OF  PARTICIPANTS. IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE YOU COULD  REMOVE PEOPLE'S NAMES OR ONLY PUBLISH SUMMARIES LIKE AVERAGES  AND TOTALS BUT IT'S EASY TO RECONNECT NAMES TO DATA SETS  USING POWERFUL COMPUTERS. AND THERE'S A MATHEMATICAL  THEOREM THAT GUARANTEES EVERY PIECE OF INFORMATION HOWEVER  SMALL WILL INHERENTLY VIOLATE THE PRIVACY OF THE PARTICIPANTS  TO SOME DEGREE. THE MORE INFORMATION YOU  PUBLICLY RELEASE, THE MORE YOU VIOLATE THE INDIVIDUAL  PRIVACIES OF THE PARTICIPANTS.  HOW DO YOU MEASURE LOSS OF PRIVACY AN PROTECT IT?  TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO MEASURE PRIVACY IT'S HELPFUL TO IMAGINE  HOW SOMEBODY WOULD USE PUBLISHED RESULTS AND PIECE  TOGETHER PRIVATE INFORMATION OF PEOPLE SURVEYED.  THEY COULD TRY TO STEAL OR GAIN DIRECT ACCESS TO PRIVATE  INFORMATION ITSELF WHICH CAN'T BE PROTECTED AGAINST  MATHEMATICALLY, REQUIRES GOOD COMPUTER SECURITY OR PHYSICAL  DEFENSES. WE WON'T CONSIDER IT HERE.  THE PRIVACY ATTACK WE CAN DEFEND AGAINST MATHEMATICALLY  IS ATTACK THAT LOOKS AT PUBLICLY PUBLISHED STATISTICS,  APPLIES BRUTE FORCE COMPUTATIONAL POWER TO MEASURE  ALL ANSWERS GIVEN TO SEE WHICH ARE THE MOST PLAUSIBLE.  WHICH ONES FIT THE PUBLISHED STATISTICS BEST.  IMAGINE CHECKING ALL POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS OF LETTERS, CHECKING ALL POSSIBLE  COMBINATIONS 330 MILLION PEOPLE WOULD GIVE TO SEE WHICH  COMBINATIONS COME CLOSEST TO THE PUBLICLY PUBLISHED FIGURES  FOR AVERAGE AGE, RACIAL BREAKDOWN, SO ON.  THE MORE CLOSELY A POTENTIAL COMBINATION OF ANSWERS MATCHES  PUBLISHED FIGURES, MORE PROMISING A CANDIDATE IT IS  FROM THE ATTACKER'S PERSPECTIVE.  THE MORE POORLY IT MATCHES, LOWER LEVEL OF CERTAINTY.  IF THERE ARE SEVEN PEOPLE IN A PARTICULAR AREA, YOU TELL ME  FOUR ARE FEMALE, FOUR LIKE ICE CREAM, FOUR MARRIED, THREE  FEMALE, IF YOU GIVE ME MEAN AND MEDIAN AGES, I CAN PERFECTLY  RECONSTRUCT THE AGE, SEX, ICE CREAM PREFERENCES OF EVERYONE  INVOLVED. I WOULD START WITH THE THREE  ICE CREAM LOVING FAMILIES, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF  POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS OF AGES FOR THREE PEOPLE, ONLY A SMALL  FRACTION OF THOSE, 36 IN FACT, ARE PLAUSIBLE.  THEY ARE IN THE RIGHT COMBINATION TO GIVE MEDIAN AGE  OF 36, MEAN AGE OF 36 AND 2/3. SAME FOR FOUR FEMALES OVERALL,  100 MILLION POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS, BUT ONLY 24 AGE  COMBINATIONS CONSISTENT WITH MEDIAN OF 30, MEAN OF 33 1/2,  WITH AT LEAST 1 OF THE PLAUSIBLE AGE COMBINATIONS FOR  THREE ICE CREAM LOVERS. CONTINUING WITH THIS DEDUCTION  LEADS TO A SINGLE PLAUSIBLE AND PERFECT RECONSTRUCTION OF ALL  THE AGES, SEXES, ICE CREAM PREFERENCES OF THE PEOPLE  INVOLVED. A 100% VIOLATION OF PRIVACY.  IF HOWEVER YOU DIDN'T LIST HOW MANY ICE CREAM LOVERS WERE  FEMALE, THERE WOULD BE TWO PLAUSIBLE POSSIBILITIES, I  WOULD BE LESS CERTAIN WHICH WAS THE TRUE COMBINATION OF AGES AND GENDERS, WITH LESS  DATA HIGHER NUMBER OF PLAUSIBLE,  LESS CERTAIN, THIS IS HOW WE MEASURE LOSS OF PRIVACY FROM  PUBLISHING RESULTS. ALL POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS ARE  SIMILARLY PLAUSIBLE, ATTACKER CAN'T DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THEM  VERY WELL. SO PRIVACY IS WELL PROTECTED.  IF A SMALL NUMBER OF POSSIBILITIES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY  MORE PLAUSIBLE THAN THE REST, THEY STAND OUT.  PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY STAND OUT, THEY ARE ALSO LIKELY TO BE  CLOSE TO THE TRUTH. TO PROTECT PRIVACY, ALL  POSSIBILITIES NEED TO SEEM SIMILARLY PLAUSIBLE OR THERE CAN'T BE PEAKS TOO  CONSPICUOUSLY, MEASURING THE MAXIMUM SLOPE OF THE GRAPH, IF  NOT STEEP YOU CAN'T HAVE SHARP PEAKS THAT STAND OUT.  HOW DO WE PUBLISH STATISTICS IN A WAY THAT LIMITS MAXIMUM SLOPE  AND POSSIBLE PEAKS?  CHOOSING ONE SCENARIO, CHANGE OR JITTER PUBLISHED VALUES,  LIKE ROLLING A DIE AND ADDING TO THE AVERAGE AGE REPORTED FOR  ICE CREAM LOVERS. JITTERING PUBLISHED RESULTS  PUTS LIMIT ON SLOPE OF THE GRAPH AND MAKES IT HARD TO  STAND OUT. JITTERING RESULTS MIGHT SEEM  LIKE LYING BUT AS LONG AS THE SIZE OF ADJUSTMENT IS NOT BIG  ENOUGH TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO CONCLUSIONS, IT'S  CONSIDERED WORTH IT FOR THE PRIVACY PROTECTION.  FOR EXAMPLE, IMAGINE I WANT TO GIVE A SENSE OF AGE WHILE  KEEPING TRUE AGE SECRET F I TOLD YOU MY AGE, ONE PLAUSIBLE  POSSIBILITY. 31.  SUPPOSE THAT I PULL A NUMBER BETWEEN MINUS AND FIVE OUT OF A  HAT AND ADD IT, YOU DON'T KNOW MY AGE EXACTLY.  PRIVACY PRESERVED, YOU CAN BE CONFIDENT I'M NOT 20 AND 40, TO  PROTECT MORE MINUS 10 AND 10 AND ADD TO MY AGE, INCREASING POSSIBLE TRUE  AGES AND INCREASES UNCERTAINTY ABOUT MY ACTUAL AGE.  TRADEOFF FOR PRIVACY IS INACCURACY.  IF I WANT YOU TO KNOW MY AGE WITHIN A YEAR, I COULD PULL A  NUMBER BETWEEN MINUS 1 AND 1 OUT OF A HAT.  MORE PRIVACY MEANS YOU GET LESS ACCURACY.  LESS PRIVACY MEANS YOU CAN HAVE MORE ACCURACY IF YOU DO THINGS  RIGHT. WHEN YOU PUBLISH RESULTS,  HOPEFULLY THERE'S A SWEET SPOT WHERE YOU CAN SHARE SOMETHING  USEFUL AND MAINTAIN PRIVACY. SIMULTANEOUSLY MAINTAINING  DECENT PRIVACY AND DECENT ACCURACY GETS EASIER AND EASIER  WITH LARGER DATA SETS LIKE HOW AS I ADD MORE NOISE TO THE  IMAGE YOU CAN GET THE GENERAL PICTURE EVEN ONCE YOU LOST ANY  HOPE OF TELLING THE TRUE ORIGINAL VALUE OF A PARTICULAR  PIXEL. TO PROTECT PEOPLE'S PRIVACY WE  CAN AND SHOULD RANDOMLY JITTER PUBLISHED STATISTICS WHICH THE  U.S. CENSUS HAS BEEN DOING SINCE THE 1970s.  HOWEVER THERE'S A SUBTLETY. YOU CAN'T ADD ANY OLD RANDOM  NOISE, IF I ADD DIFFERENT RANDOM NOISE TO THIS PICTURE,  ONCE YOU TAKE THE AVERAGE, YOU BASICALLY GET BACK THE ORIGINAL  CLEAN IMAGE, YOU DON'T WANT THIS HAPPENING TO YOUR DATA.  SO THERE'S A WHOLE FIELD OF COMPUTER SCIENCE DEDICATED TO  FIGURING OUT HOW TO ADD LEAST POSSIBLE AMOUNT OF NOISE TO GET  MOST PRIVACY AND MOST ACCURACY AND FUTURE PROOF THE  PUBLICATION OF DATA SO THEY CAN'T BE COMBINED TO  RECONSTRUCT PEOPLE'S DATA BUT THROUGH THE 2010 CENSUS THE  CENSUS BUREAU COULDN'T PROMISE THIS.  SURE THEY WERE JITTERING FIGURES PUBLISHED IN CENSUS  BUREAU TABLES AND CHARTS BUT NOT IN A MATHEMATICALLY  RIGOROUS WAY. THE CENSUS BUREAU COULDN'T  MATHEMATICALLY PROMISE ANYTHING ABOUT PROTECTING PRIVACY OR HOW  BADLY IT'S BEEN VIOLATED UNTIL NOW.  2020 CENSUS IS DIFFERENT, IT WILL BE USING MATHEMATICALLY  RIGOROUS PRIVACY PROTECTIONS, ONE OF THE BENEFITS IS THAT IT  RELIABLY COMPOUNDS OVER MULTIPLE PIECES OF INFORMATION.  LIKE IF WE PUBLISH BOTH AVERAGE AGE AND MEDIAN AGE, EACH WITH  LOSS FACTOR OF 3, LOSS FACTOR FOR HAVING RELEASED BOTH IS AT  MOST 6. THIS MEANS YOU CAN DECIDE ON A  TOTAL CUMULATIVE AMOUNT OF LOSS AND WHETHER YOU WANT TO  RELEASE, SAY, 10 PIECES OF INFORMATION EACH WITH 1/10 LOSS  OR IF YOU WANT TO RELEASE ONE PIECE OF INFORMATION WITH THE  FULL PRIVACY LOSS AND HIGHER LEVEL OF ACCURACY.  HOW MUCH PRIVACY WE NEED IS HARD.  IT INVOLVES WEIGHING HOW MUCH WE VALUE THE POSSIBLE BENEFITS  FROM KNOWING STUFF VERSUS POSITIVIBLE DRAWBACKS OF  RELEASING SOME AMOUNT OF PRIVATE INFORMATION.  SECOND EVEN THOUGH BENEFITS AND DRAWBACKS CAN BE MEASURED, WE  HAVE TO TRANSLATE MATHEMATICAL IDEAS OF ACCURACY AND PRIVACY  LOSS INTO SOMETHING THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE AND RELATABLE TO  PEOPLE IN OUR SOCIETY. THAT'S PARTLY A GOAL OF THE  VIDEO. LET'S GIVE IT ONE MORE SHOT AT  TRANSLATION. FIRST AND FOREMOST, IT'S  IMPOSSIBLE TO PUBLISH USEFUL STATISTICS BASED ON PRIVATE  DATA WITHOUT IN SOME WAY VIOLATING PRIVACY OF THE  INDIVIDUALS IN QUESTION. IF YOU WANT TO PROVIDE  MATHEMATICALLY GUARANTEED LIMIT ON AMOUNT OF PRIVACY VIOLATION,  YOU HAVE TO JITTER THE STATISTICS TO PROTECT THE  PRIVATE DATA. THE ACCURACY OF THE INFORMATION  AFTER BEING JITTERED IS DESCRIBED BY SAYING SOMETHING  LIKE IF WE JITTER THE TRUE VALUE FOR POPULATION OF THE  TOWN, 98% OUR JITTERED STATISTICS WOULD BE WITHIN 10  PEOPLE. HOW CLOSE YOU WANT TO BE AND  HOW LIKELY IT IS. THE LOSS OF PRIVACY IS  DESCRIBED IN TERMS OF HOW CONFIDENTLY AN ATTACKER WOULD  SINGLE OUT A PARTICULAR POSSIBILITY FOR TRUE DATA.  GIVEN PUBLISHED INFORMATION ARE THERE A FEW POSSIBILITIES FOR  TRUE DATA OR MANY, MANY PLAUSIBLE  POSSIBILITIED? MEASURED BY PROMINENCE OF PEAKS  ON THE PLOT, SO THE PROTECTION OF PRIVACY REQUIRES POLICING  THE POSSIBILITY FOR SUCH PEAKS. IF WE INDIVIDUALS ARE GOING TO  WILLINGLY PARTICIPATE IN STUDIES AND SURVEYS OR USE  SERVICES WHERE WE REVEAL POTENTIALLY SENSITIVE PERSONAL  INFORMATION WE SHOULD DEMAND RESEARCHERS UTILIZE ROBUST WAY  OF PROTECTING PRIVACY. SIMPLY PUT, IF THEY CAN'T  GUARANTEE THERE WON'T BE PEAK IN PLAUSIBLEITY, WE  SHOULDN'T AGREE TO GIVE THEM A PEEK AT DATA.  THANKS FOR SUPPORTING THIS VIDEO.  THE FOUNDERS OF THE UNITED STATES UNDERSTAND ACCURATE  COUNT IS NECESSARY FOR FAIR  REPRESENTATION OF DEMOCRACY. THE 2020 CENSUS WILL BE THE  FIRST TO USE MODERN SAFEGUARDS TO PROTECT FROM TODAY'S PRIVACY  THREATS, PROTECTING CONFIDENTIALITY WHILE ALLOWING  CENSUS BUREAU TO DELIVER ACCURATE COUNT OF THE NATION'S  POPULATION. THEY WILL GIVE THOSE WHO RELY  ON DATA INCREASED CLARITY REGARDING IMPACT SAFEGUARDS  HAVE ON ANALYSES AND DECISION MAKING.  THE CENSUS BUREAU VIEWS ADOPTION OF MATHEMATICAL  GUARANTEE AS A WIN-WIN. NOW PROTECTING CENSUS BUREAU  DATA FROM HACKING IS ANOTHER QUESTION.  HERE IS HOW THE CHIEF SCIENTIST THINKS.  THERE'S A CHOICE EVERY CURATOR HAS TO MAKE, THE CURATOR HAS TO  BE PREPARED TO GIVE AND IMPLEMENT GUARANTEES OF  PRIVACY. UNFORTUNATELY THIS MEANS  THERE'S A CONSTRAINT ON AMOUNT OF INFORMATION YOU CAN PUBLISH.  MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVIDE ACCURATE ANSWERS FOR AS  MANY QUESTIONS AS YOU WANT WHILE PROTECTING THE PRIVACY OF  RESPONDENTS. CURATORS NEED TO UNDERSTAND  NEEDS AND DESIRES OF PEOPLE WHO PROVIDE DATA AND WANT TO USE  DATA TO DETERMINE WHAT BALANCE OF ACCURACY VERSUS PRIVACY AND NOT PUBLISH ANSWERS TO UNIMPORTANT QUESTIONS. ^^ OKAY.  IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH HENRY RIKE, REGULAR SERIES IS  MINUTE PHYSICS, HE'S KNOWN TO -- A PH.D. PHYSICIST KNOWN TO  TAKE VERY DIFFICULT CONCEPTS LIKE SPECIAL RELATIVITY, FOR  EXAMPLE, AND TRANSLATE THEM INTO VIDEOS OF COMPARABLE  LENGTH AND I HOPE CLARITY TO THE ONE YOU JUST SAW.  JENNY STARTED US OFF WITH HOW WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO MEASURE  WHAT RESPONDENTS UNDERSTAND ABOUT CONFIDENTIALITY  PROTECTION AND HOW A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE  EVENTUALLY OF THE U.S. PUBLIC FEELS ABOUT THE TRADEOFF  BETWEEN ACCURACY AND PRIVACY. THEY ARE CERTAINLY A VERY  IMPORTANT PLAYER IN THE UNDERLYING DECISIONS THAT THE  CENSUS BUREAU WILL HAVE TO MAKE.  I WANT TO STRESS BEFORE I DO THIS DISCLOSURE AVOIDANCE  UPDATE THE CENSUS BUREAU IS ACTING AS STEWARD IN THIS CASE,  BOUND BY SECTION 9 OF TITLE 13 TO PROTECT CONFIDENTIAL, EVEN  THOSE REIDENTIFICATIONS THAT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED FROM  TABULAR SUMMARIES. WE UNDERSTAND THAT TO BE A RISK  TRADEOFF, AND ADDRESSING THAT RISK TRADEOFF IS PROPERLY A  SOCIAL CHOICE THAT INVOLVES DISCUSSIONS WITH LOTS OF  COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST ABOUT THE RELEVANT USES OF DATA AND  PRIVACY CONCERNS. I WANT TO ENCOURAGE AS MUCH  CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT AS WE CAN HAVE IN THIS FORUM AND IN  OTHER FORUMS, TO HELP CENSUS BUREAU BE A GOOD DATA STEWARD.  SO, SOME OF THIS WAS COVERED IN THE FIRST PRESENTATION THIS  MORNING BUT I'LL REPEAT IT. ON THE END-TO-END TEST WE  DEPLOYED SIMPLIFIED VERSION OF 2020 DISCLOSURE AVOIDANCE SYSTEM AND RELEASED  THE CODE BASE, THE FIRST BLUE LINE THERE.  AND THAT PROTOTYPE PL 94-171 DATABASE FOR  PROVIDENCE 0.25, THE REASONS ARE DOCUMENTED IN THE DECISION  MEMO THAT IS REFERENCED IN THE SECOND ONE, BASICALLY THE ONLY  USE CASE FOR THOSE DATA WAS TO TEST THE COMPUTER PROGRAMS OF  REDISTRICTORS THAT THE FILE FORMATS WERE COLLECT AND  LOADED. THERE WAS NO ACCURACY USE CASE  AT ALL. CENSUS BUREAU I THINK CORRECTLY  DIDN'T ASSIGN A LARGE BUDGET TO THOSE TEST PRODUCTS.  WE WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE VULNERABILITY ASSOCIATED  WITH DATABASE RECONSTRUCTION AND INCREASED RISK OF  REIDENTIFICATION IT ALLOWS IS KNOWN TO BE A VULNERABILITY OF  ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO ADDRESS FOR MANY  OF THEM FOR A LOT OF REASONS THAT WHEN WE GET AROUND TO THAT  IN A FEW NAC MEETINGS WE'LL ELABORATE, BUT WE'VE STATED  PUBLICLY THAT DEPUTY DIRECTOR WROTE THE BLOG THAT WE WON'T  APPLY FORMAL PRIVACY TO THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY  BEFORE 2025, WILL ENGAGE IN HOPEFULLY A LESS RUSHED BUT THE  SAME WIDE OPEN DISCUSSION WITH THE USER COMMUNITY ABOUT THE  PROPOSED METHODS AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS BEFORE MOVING  FORWARD WITH THAT. ALL RIGHT.  SO WE'RE JUST TOTALLY FOCUSED ON THE 2020 CENSUS WITH REGARD  TO THIS INNOVATION, AT LEAST RIGHT NOW.  SO, I WANT TO EXPLAIN TO YOU THE NEXT STEP IN OUR DISCLOSURE  AVOIDANCE SYSTEM, WHICH IS METHODS WE USED TO PRODUCE  DEMONSTRATION PRODUCTS WHICH WERE RELEASED ON OCTOBER 28th,  THEY WERE RELEASED ON TUESDAY OF THAT WEEK, 26th I THINK.  THE BLOG AND WEB PAGES YOU SAW EARLIER.  I COULDN'T PUT THE RELEASE DATA INTEGRITY IN MY SLIDES EITHER,  I DON'T BELIEVE, THAT'S WHY I DON'T HAVE IT TO REMIND ME.  SO, YOU'LL SEE DISCUSSION IN HERE TECHNICAL TERM HOW BIG IS  THE HISTOGRAM FOR THIS SET OF STATISTICS.  SO, THAT'S LANGUAGE THAT'S FAMILIAR TO COMPUTER SCIENTISTS  WHO WORK IN THIS AREA, LESS FAMILIAR WITH DATA USERS IN THE  SOCIAL SCIENCE COMMUNITY. SO IF I TOLD YOU IT'S THE  CONTINGENCY TABLE THAT ALLOWS FOR ALL POSSIBLE INTERACTIONS,  THAT'S THE SAME THING. SO EVERY TIME I SAY HISTOGRAM,  MENTALLY SUBSTITUTE THE CONTINGENCY TABLE ALLOWING FOR  ALL POSSIBLE INTERACTIONS. ALL POSSIBLE INTERACTION  EXPLODE THE SIZE OF THE HISTOGRAM WITH DIMENSIONALITY  YOU WOULD EXPECT, MULTIPLY TWO SEXES BY 116 AGE CATEGORIES, BY  TWO ETHNICITY CATEGORIES, AND SO FORTH.  THEY ARE LISTED OUT HERE. IN THIS CASE BY JUST SEVEN  HOUSEHOLD LEVEL VARIABLES, SO WHETHER YOU'RE IN A HOUSEHOLD  OR ONE OF THE SEVEN MAJOR GROUP QUARTER TYPES, THAT EXPANDS  HISTOGRAMS FOR PERSONS FROM THE 2012 CELL HISTOGRAM USED FOR  THE TEST IN 400,000, ROUND NUMBERS, FULL HISTOGRAM FOR  DHCP IS ABOUT A MILLION AND A HALF.  SO WE'RE ABOUT A THIRD OF THE WAY THERE, BUT WE CAN GET A  LARGE PROPORTION OF THE STATISTICS IN DHC WITH THIS  400,000-PERSON HISTOGRAM. WE DECIDED THIS WAS THE SWEET  SPOT FOR DOING A DEMONSTRATION PRODUCT THAT SHOWS HOW IT WORKS  ON A LARGE ENOUGH COLLECTION OF THE DATA, SO THAT THERE ARE  MEANINGFUL USES THAT THE 2010 DATA WERE ORIGINALLY PUT TO  THAT CAN BE REVIEWED USING THIS TEST PRODUCT.  SIMILARLY FOR HOUSING AND HOUSEHOLDS, THE OVERALL --  THERE WAS NO HISTOGRAM FOR HOUSING AND HOUSEHOLDS IN THE  END-TO-END TEST PRODUCT, ONE HOUSEHOLD LEVEL TABLE, AND  TECHNOLOGY DIDN'T EXIST TO PROTECT VARIABLES SO THAT  VARIABLE VACANCY RATE WAS NOT PROTECTED IN THE END TO END  TEST BUT IS PROTECTED IN DEMONSTRATION PRODUCT AND WILL  BE PROTECTED IN FINAL PRODUCTS. NOW THE HISTOGRAM ON THE ORDER  OF 400,000, IT RUNS THROUGH THE SAME CODE BASE SO THIS IS  EXERCISING ESSENTIALLY THE SAME CAPABILITIES, AND YOU CAN SEE  VARIOUS ATTRIBUTES THAT HAD TO BE TABLED UP IN ORDER TO  PRODUCE THAT CONTINGENCY TABLE OR HISTOGRAM.  SO, WHAT WE DID THEN IS ASSIGN A PRIVACY LOSS BUDGET -- THERE  IT IS, THE DATE IS IN THIS ONE, OCTOBER 29.  ASSIGN A PRIVACY LOSS BUDGET OF SIX TO THESE PRODUCTS.  THAT WAS DONE IN A MEETING OF DSEP THAT OCCURRED DURING THE  FULL CSAC MEETING WHILE CSAC WAS DISCUSSING RECOMMENDATIONS,  WE ADJOURNED THE FRONT OF THE TABLE, ADJOURNED TO DSEP FOR AN  HOUR MEETING, THAT MEETING TOOK TWO AND A HALF HOURS, AND  ARRIVED AT THE COMPROMISE YOU SEE HERE, THE PRIVACY LOSS  BUDGET FOR THE PERSON TABLES OF FOUR, HOUSING UNIT TABLES OF  TWO. AND THE BEST WAY TO  CHARACTERIZE THAT MEETING IS THAT NO ONE WALKED OUT OF IT  HAPPY. SO, YOU KNOW THAT IT INVOLVED  SIGNIFICANT DISCUSSION AND COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE VARIOUS  DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT DIMENSIONS ACCURACY NEEDED TO  BE MAINTAINED IN, AND HOW DISCLOSIVE THE FINAL PRODUCTS  COULD BE. THE SAME DISCUSSIONS NOW HAVE  TO HAPPEN HOPEFULLY IN A MUCH MORE PUBLIC WAY IN THE SENSE WE  WANT PEOPLE WHO USE THE DEMONSTRATION PRODUCTS AND WHO  GIVE US ADVICE REGARDING THE 2020 CENSUS TO UNDERSTAND HOW  THESE TRADEOFFS WORK BY LOOKING AT REAL DATA PRODUCTS AND  UNDERSTANDING THAT WITH A FIXED PRIVACY LOSS BUDGET, THE  ACCURACY IN ONE PART OF THE PUBLICATIONS HAS TO COME FROM  ACCURACY IN OTHER PARTS OF THE PUBLICATIONS, AND YOU CAN'T  TAKE THE PRIVACY LOSS BUDGET ALL THE WAY TO INFINITY OR  YOU'LL BE BACK IN THE SAME SITUATION THAT WE WERE IN FOR  THE 2010 CENSUS. SO IT IS A DIFFICULT PROBLEM,  AND WE WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT'S A DIFFICULT PROBLEM AND WE WANT  TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WHILE THE STATUTE PUT THE OBLIGATION TO  MAKE THE FINAL DECISIONS WITH THE CENSUS BUREAU, THIS IS A  PUBLIC DECISION. IT NEEDS TO BE GUIDED BY INPUT  FROM THE USER COMMUNITY AND FROM THE PUBLIC AND PRIVACY  COMMUNITIES. WE NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE SPEAK UP  ABOUT THIS AND WE'RE QUITE CERTAIN I THINK NOW THAT YOU  WILL. WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO.  WE ARE LISTENING. WE HAVEN'T MADE ANY FINAL  DECISIONS FOR THE 2020 CENSUS AND DESIGNED WHAT'S USED FOR  DEMONSTRATION PRODUCTS AND NO SOFTWARE FOR PRODUCTS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER TODAY.  THERE IS NOT HARD WIRED IN THESE ALGORITHMS.  THAT SAID, IT IS A COMPLICATED PROCESS, UNDERSTANDING HOW THEY  WORK IS GOING TO TAKE SOME HEAVY LIFTING ON THE PARTS OF  THE USER, INSIDE THE CENSUS BUREAU.  SO, WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO THAT.  AND WE'LL NOTE THAT IN ADDITION TO THE CNSTAT WORKSHOP THAT  WILL HAPPEN ON DECEMBER 11 AND 12 AND EXPERT SUMMARIES THEY  WILL PROVIDE FOR US AFTER THAT, THERE WAS A HARVARD REVIEW  WORKSHOP ON OCTOBER 25 THAT HAD PRESENTATIONS BY BOTH USERS AND  PRIVACY EXPERTS, AND THEY THOROUGHLY EXERCISED THE  VERSION OF THE ALGORITHM WE USED FOR THE END-TO-END TEST  PRODUCTS, THERE'S ALREADY SOME PRETTY ACTIVE DISCUSSION OF  THIS GOING, AND THAT ACTIVE DISCUSSION IS TAMPA TAMPA TILL  TATED BY -- FACILITATED BY DEMONSTRATION AND ABILITY TO  LOAD 1940 CENSUS INTO THE IMPACT OF EXACT ALGORITHMS, AND  THEY ARE PUBLIC, SO PEOPLE HAVE STARTED TO DO THAT.  THE NEW CODE BASE THAT SUPPORTS 2010 DEMONSTRATION PRODUCTS  WILL BE RELEASED THIS MONTH, CODE BASE IS READY, WE'RE  REVIEWING DOCUMENTATION HOW TO IMELEMENT IT. -- IMPLEMENT IT.  WE'LL RELEASE RUNS ON 1940 CENSUS, NOT SIMULTANEOUSLY,  THEY TAKE 60 TO 70 HOURS EACH SO TO GET A FULL SUITE OF RUNS  ON THE 1940 CENSUS EVEN ON OUR OWN EQUIPMENT WILL TAKE US SOME  TIME. WE WILL DO THAT.  ALL RIGHT. THAT'S ALL I HAD TO SAY.  AND I'VE LEFT PLENTY OF TIME FOR QUESTIONS.  THANK YOU. ^^ LET'S GET GOING WITH  QUESTIONS. TAEKU WAS OUR FIRST QUESTION.  ^^ THANK YOU. TWO QUICK POINTS ON THE PROOF  OF CONCEPT SURVEY. ^^ ON THE PHONE LINES IF YOU  WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION PRESS STAR-1, MAKE SURE YOUR  OWN IS UNMIGHTED, STATE YOUR QUESTION.  GUIDE THE DECISION MAKING IN  TERMS OF HOW THE PUBLIC PERCEIVES PRIVACY, ACCURACY  TRADEOFFS. IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT DIFFERENCE  BETWEEN 40% OR 45% WOULD BE IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY INFORMING  DECISION MAKING AND I GUESS I WANTED TO REGISTER GENERAL  SKEPTICISM ABOUT HOW THE VIEWS OF THE PUBLIC AROUND THEIR  PRIVACY CONCERNS WOULD ACTUALLY INFORM DECISION MAKING AS  OPPOSED TO USING THIS KIND OF SURVEY TO UNDERSTAND KNOWLEDGE  GAPS SO THAT CENSUS BUREAU COULD EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ABOUT  PRIVACY INFORMATION, ACCURACY TRADEOFFS.  THANK YOU. ^^ SURE, I CAN TAKE THE FIRST  PART OF THAT QUESTION. THEY ARE UNWEIGHTED BECAUSE OF  LOW RESPONSE RATE. WHEN WE GET A BETTER SAMPLE AND  SURVEY WE'LL SHOW WEIGHTED  DISTRIBUTIONS. JOHN, DO YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THE SECOND PART?  ^^. ^^ WE'RE LOOK FORK DATA THAT  CAN BE IN PRINCIPLE -- LOOKING FOR DATA THAT CAN BE USEFUL.  RESEARCH TEAMS, ECONOMISTS AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENTISTS, HAVE  WAYS OF TRANSLATING THESE SURVEY DATA INTO USABLE INDICES  WHERE ABSOLUTE LEVEL OF RESPONSES DOESN'T NECESSARILY  -- ISN'T NECESSARILY MEANINGFUL BUT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE  RESPONSES OR RATIOS, THERE ARE MULTIPLE WAYS TO SET IT UP.  THEY CAN BE INFORMATIVE. WE'RE COGNIZANT ATTEMPTS TO  ELICIT PREFERENCES ABOUT THESE ASPECTS OF PUBLIC GOODS,  PRIVACY PROTECTION AND DATA ACCURACY, CAN BE PROBLEMATIC IN  SURVEY SETTING AND LABORATORY SETTING.  THAT'S ESSENTIALLY STATEMENT ABOUT THE STATE OF THE SCIENCE,  MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. AND WE CAN ADVANCE IT ONLY AS  FAST AS IT GIVES IN TO OUR REPEATED ATTEMPTS.  IT'S INSTRUCTIVE THAT THE RESPONDENTS IN SURVEYS HAVE  DEMONSTRATED THAT THEY HAVE DIFFERENTIAL SENSITIVITY ABOUT  THE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ON 2020 CENSUS.  THIS PARTICULAR SURVEY ISN'T HYPOTHETICAL, SUPPOSE I ASKED  YOU ABOUT THIS. THE RESPONDENTS TAKE THE 2020  CENSUS BEFORE THE SURVEY STARTS, SO I THINK THE  LABORATORY TESTING AND FIELD TESTING HAVE INDICATED THAT  THAT DOES A GOOD JOB OF ANCHORING THEIR RESPONSES, ON  THE SPECIFIC CONCERNS THAT OTHERS AREN'T THE TABLE HAVE  RAISED. HOW SHOULD WE THINK ABOUT THE  HARM ASSOCIATED WITH PRIVACY LEAKAGE, THAT'S THE SENSE WE'LL  USE THESE RESULTS TO GUIDE OUR THINKING.  ^^ I WANTED TO JUST WEIGH IN ON THIS.  AND I WANTED TO COMMEND FIRST OF ALL JENNIFER AND JOHN FOR  BRINGING THIS UP. IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC.  I DON'T THINK ANYONE IN THIS ROOM WOULD DISAGREE WITH THE  FACT WE ALL TAKE PRIVACY VERY SERIOUSLY AND WE UNDERSTAND THE  CENSUS BUREAU TAKES TITLE 13 RESPONSIBILITIES VERY  SERIOUSLY. ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE'RE  SEEING WITH THIS IS AS GOOD AS THE VIDEO IS IT'S MISSING THE  MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENT, OKAY WE GET THE NEED TO INJECT NOISE  TO PROTECT PRIVACY, WHAT IS THE IMPACT GOING TO BE ON THE DATA  THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR THE DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE THAT  AFFECT OUR COMMUNITIES THE MOST?  AND IN PARTICULAR THESE FALL AT LEAST IN TERMS OF WHAT WE  TYPICALLY DEAL WITH, TWO BROAD CATEGORIES,  APPROPRIATIONS BASED ON COUNTS, INDIAN COUNTRY, HOUSING, ROADS, WIC-SHIP, SOCIAL SERVICES. WITHIN LITIGATION WE ENFORCE  FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS STATUTES THAT SPECIFICALLY SAY THAT THE  DATA THE CENSUS RELEASES IS INDISPUTABLE AND WE RELY ON THAT, THAT THE COURT MUST TAKE JUDICIAL NOTICE.  THE CONCERN FROM A LITIGATOR'S PERSPECTIVE CAN  THE COURT DO IS THAT IF YOU'RE INJECTING NOISE AND THEY ARE  NOT REAL NUMBERS. BOTTOM LINE IS IT'S NOT THE  ONLY COMMUNITY AFFECTED BY THIS.  I THINK THAT OTHERS WOULD AGREE WITH THAT.  THE REASON WHY THE AFFECTS THIS COMMUNITY SO MUCH IS BECAUSE SO  MANY PARTS OF INDIAN COUNTRY ARE THE MUCH MORE SPARSELY  POPULATED COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE DIRECTLY  AFFECTED BY DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY.  SO, I KNOW THIS IS A LONG-WINDED PIECE.  I WANTED TO GET IT OUT THERE. AND WE YESTERDAY ADOPTED A  RECOMMENDATION FOR THE NAC TO SET UP A DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY  WORKING GROUP AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE  BUREAU IS RECEPTIVE TO DOING IN CONNECTION WITH, IN  PARTNERSHIP, IN COLLABORATION WITH THE CSAC.  I THINK THE OTHER THING YOU SAID THAT I -- WE'LL PUT IN THE  FORM OF A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION IS WE UNDERSTAND  THAT YOU MAY BE OPERATING WITH CERTAIN TIMELINES, IT WOULD  REALLY INFORM ANY WORKING GROUP THAT'S ESTABLISHED TO KNOW UP  FRONT TIMELINES TO MAKE SURE INPUT WE GIVE CAN BE GIVEN IN A  TIMELY AND MEANINGFUL WAY BEFORE THE DECISION IS MADE.  THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENTS.  SPEAKING FOR THE DATA STEWARDSHIP EXECUTIVE POLICY  COMMITTEE BUT NOT IN OFFICIAL CAPACITY, THAT'S EXACTLY THE  INPUT WE WANT. AND THE REASON WHY WE ARE  PUTTING OUT DEMONSTRATION PRODUCTS AND WILL ATTEMPT TO  PUT THEM OUT FOR THE MORE DETAILED RACE, ETHNICITY AND AAIN AS WELL.  YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT TIMELINES. WE'RE WAITING FOR ANNOUNCEMENTS  CONTRACTS ARE IN PLACE BEFORE WE MAKE A PUBLIC STATEMENT  ABOUT EXACTLY -- I TOLD YOU APPROXIMATE TIME LINE.  YOU UNDERSTAND CONTRACTING CONSTRAINTS THERE.  TO THE BROADER POINT, IT WAS MADE IN THE VIDEO BUT WASN'T  PERHAPS BEAT HOME WITH A HAMMER, WE'VE BEEN ALTERING THE  DATA IN THE PUBLICATIONS USED FOR ALL THE PURPOSES THAT YOU  DELINEATED SINCE 1970. IT HAS NOT BEEN TRANSPARENT,  AND IT WOULD NOT SURPRISE ME IF SOME OF THE JUDICIAL  INTERPRETATIONS SUFFERED FROM THAT LACK OF TRANSPARENCY.  BUT IN THE AREAS WHERE THE CENSUS NUMBERS NEED TO BE  CONTROLLING, THEY ARE CONTROLLING BECAUSE THEY ARE  OFFICIAL. AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE THE  OFFICIAL DATA AS ACCURATE AS IT CAN BE, WITHIN THE PRIVACY LOSS  BUDGET, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY CONCENTRATION PRIVACY LOSS  BUDGET ON COMPONENTS OF THE OFFICIAL DATA THAT HAVE THE  MOST COMPELLING USE CASES. SO WE STARTED WITH  CONSTITUTION, WE WENT TO THE STATUTE THAT IS -- DICTATES  FORM OF REDISTRICTING DATA NOT IN THE STATUTE, DICTATES  PROCESS BY WHICH THAT WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED.  AND WENT TO GREAT PAINS I THINK TO ENSURE THAT THAT -- PROCESS  UNDERLYING THE WAY WE PRODUCE REDISTRICTING DATA IS RESPECTED  IN THE ALGORITHM. SO NOW THE MORE GENERAL USE  CASES NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BY THE COMMUNITY, ISOLATED AND  BROAD BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION SO WE CAN COLLECT THEM AND BE  PROPERLY COGNIZANT AS WE'RE BALANCING.  WE HAVE ALWAYS DONE STATISTICAL DISCLOSURE, DISCLOSURE  AVOIDANCE, THE CENSUS BUREAU NAME FOR IT.  TRANSPARENCY ALLOWS TO US HAVE THIS KIND OF DISCUSSION AND  ALLOWS IT TO BE CLEAR, THE INTERESTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE  PRIVACY PROTECTION AND VARIOUS USE CASE IS THAT DETERMINE  ACCURACY. THAT'S AN IMPORTANT DISCUSSION,  THAT'S NOT JUST NAC'S RESPONSE OR CSAC'S RESPONSIBILITY OR  CENSUS BUREAU'S RESPONSIBILITY. THAT'S AMERICAN PUBLIC'S  RESPONSIBILITY THROUGH ALL OF THE VEHICLES THAT WE HAVE TO  EXPRESS OUR CONCERNS AND DESIRES.  WE NEED TO EXAMINE HOW IT IS WE AS A SOCIETY WISH TO DEFINE THE  PRIVACY RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS AND WISH TO HAVE THOSE  DEFINITIONS RESPECTED BY OUR GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS AND  PRIVATE COMPANIES. THAT DISCUSSION IS JUST  BEGINNING, AND IT WAS PROMPTED BY THE SAME REVOLUTION,  AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION, AND COMPUTING POWER THAT  NECESSITATES RETHINKING CONFIDENTIALITY PROTECTION FOR  CENSUS, BUT IT'S BASICALLY A VERY LARGE SCALE SOCIAL  PROBLEM. IT'S IN THE NEWS EVERY DAY, AS  I KNOW YOU'RE AWARE. SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THAT  INPUT. ^^ I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU  ALSO FOR THE RESPONSE. WE DO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT  I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS LOST IN THIS IS THE BUREAU WAS  TRANSPARENT IN IDENTIFYING THIS AS AN ISSUE BEFORE ANY FINAL  DECISION WAS MADE AND WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE THAT.  BUT IT REEMPHASIZED IMPORTANCE TO MAKE SURE ALL RESPECTIVE  COMMUNITIES HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN.  SO THANK YOU. ^^ ALL RIGHT.  GREAT. NEXT ON THE LIST IS MEGHAN.  ^^ THANK YOU. I'LL BE TRANSPARENT THAT I  UNDERSTAND APPROXIMATELY ONE OUT OF EVERY SIX WORDS THAT YOU  SAY ABOUT PRIVACY LOSS. SO I APOLOGIZE IF I ASK THIS  QUESTION IN A STUPID WAY. HAVING WATCHED THAT VIDEO A  COUPLE TIMES, THINKING ABOUT THE COLLECTIVE BUDGET FOR  PRIVACY LOSS, I WROTE IT DOWN SO I WOULD SAY THE RIGHT WORDS,  THE THING THAT'S SITTING WITH ME IN MY GUT IS THAT I FEEL  LIKE Y'ALL ARE DOING GREAT RESEARCH TO HEAR COLLECTIVELY  WHAT WE AS A PUBLIC THINK ABOUT PRIVACY LOSS, BUT IN REALITY  WHILE AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVES POPULATIONS  AREN'T THE ONLY FOLKS IMPACTED BY CHOICES YOU MAKE, THERE ARE  DEFINITELY A SMALL HANDFUL OF POPULATIONS THAT ARE GOING TO  BE VERY, VERY DEEPLY IMPACTED, AND THE REST OF US AREN'T.  SO WHAT WE COLLECTIVELY AS SOCIETY FEEL ABOUT PRIVACY  LOSS, IN MY MIND, IS KINDS OF IRRELEVANT.  WHAT MATTERS IS WHAT THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MOST  DEEPLY IMPACTED ARE -- YOU KNOW, FEEL ABOUT PRIVACY LOSS  CHOICES. AND I URGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT  THAT AS YOU'RE CHOOSING ABOUT HOW TO ALLOCATE THAT PRIVACY  LOSS BUDGET, THAT WHILE I MIGHT HAVE INTERNAL FEELINGS ABOUT MY  PRIVACY, THEY ARE NOT REALLY RELEVANT.  I'M A WHITE PERSON WHO IS RELATIVELY FINANCIALLY STABLE,  WHO HAS STABLE HOUSING, WHO -- YOU KNOWE DOESN'T FACE DAILY  VIOLENCE. MY PRIVACY IS LESS RELEVANT  THAN PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO HAVE DIRECT IMPACTS TO THEIR  FINANCIAL HEALTH, TO THEIR PHYSICAL HEALTH, TO THEIR  STABILITY. SO THAT'S MY BASELINE THING.  AND THEN IN HOW WE PROVIDE YOU INPUT ON THAT PRIVACY LOSS  ALLOCATION I'M CURIOUS WITH DEMONSTRATION PROJECT, PRODUCTS  YOU PUT OUT THERE, WAS THE PRIVACY LOSS BUDGET ALLOCATED  EVENLY ACROSS DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS, ACROSS  DIFFERENT TABLES, OR IS THERE ALREADY SOME SORT OF ALLOCATION  IN THAT, THAT WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT WHEN WE'RE  TRYING TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK? I HAVE NO IDEA IF THAT'S EVEN A  QUESTION THAT MAKES SENSE, SO -- OKAY, COOL.  ^^ JOHN ABOWD AGAIN. YOU'VE IDENTIFIED ONE OF THE  MOST VEXING PROBLEMS THAT GOVERNMENT CURATORS OF DATA  FACE. SO, IN OUR STATUTE, YOU CAN'T  WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PRIVACY. I THINK IN YOUR WORLD, THIS IS  HOW I HEARD YOU, YOU BELIEVE THERE ARE POPULATIONS, SOME  SMALL, SOME HARD TO IDENTIFY, WHERE THE PEOPLE IN THAT  POPULATION WOULD HAPPILY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO PRIVACY IN  EXCHANGE FOR BETTER DATA. I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT  STATEMENT, BUT THE CURRENT STATE OF TITLE 13 AND MORE GENERIC CIPSEA, JUST  ENACTED, AT THE ENDS OF THE 115th CONGRESS, BOTH LAWS DON'T ALLOW STATISTICAL AGENCIES TO HAVE AN OPT-OUT ON PRIVACY  PROTECTIONS. AND IT'S A VALID DISCUSSION,  SOMETHING I THINK COMMUNITIES LIKE THE ONES YOU ADVOCATE FOR SHOULD BE HAVING, WHETHER  SOME GROUPS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO OPT OUT, BUT UNTIL THEN WE  HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO APPLY THE SAME CONFIDENTIAL PROTECTIONS  TO THE DATA WE COLLECT FROM THEM.  IN ADDITION SINCE WE'RE MAKING GENERIC AND MEANINGFUL  PRIVATENESS OF CONFIDENTIALITY DON'T WANT ANYONE TO THINK YOU  COULD OPT OUT WITHOUT EXPLICIT AUTHORITY.  THAT'S A HARD PROBLEM. IT'S ONE THAT WE NEED TO BEGIN  ADDRESSING AS A SOCIETY, AND THE CENSUS BUREAU HOPES THAT  HAPPENS SOONER RATHER THAN LATER BUT HASN'T HAPPENED YET.  THE RIGHT WAY TO THINK ABOUT THAT IS CONSTRAINT WE  ACKNOWLEDGE, THAT WE'RE TRYING TO WORK AROUND AS BEST WE CAN,  BUT THAT'S DEFINITELY CONSTRAINT.  SO, YES, PRIVACY LOSS BUDGET IS ALLOCATED ACROSS ALL OF THE  STATISTICS THAT YOU HEARD CYNTHIA AND JASON TALK  ABOUT. AN FAQ IS BEING REVIEWED THAT  SHOWS HOW WE DID IT. THAT SAID, BECAUSE OF THE WAY  THESE ALGORITHMS WORK, YOU CAN'T GIVE AN EXACT ANSWER  BECAUSE ANY ONE STATISTIC IS MORE ACCURATE THAN THE PRIVACY  LOSS BUDGET THAT WAS ASSIGNED TO IT BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE  ALGORITHMS WORK. THAT STATEMENT CAN BE MADE  MATHEMATICALLY PRECISE BUT IT'S NOT UNDERSTANDABLE IN  MATHEMATICALLY PRECISE FORM, IT'S CALLED BORROWED STRENGTH,  THAT WILL BE POSTED AS SOON AS IT'S FINISHED GOING THROUGH  CLEARANCE. OTHER FAQs ADDRESS QUESTIONS  SIMILAR, YOU SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE TOO.  FAQs ARE ALREADY POSTED. THIS PARTICULAR ONE WASN'T  READY WHEN WE RELEASED THE FIRST BATCH.  HISTORICALLY THE CENSUS BUREAU UPDATES ON A REGULAR BASIS,  FAQs ABOUT 2010 DEMONSTRATION PROPERTIES AND 2020 DATA  PRODUCTS WILL BE UPDATED ON A REGULAR BASIS.  ^^ OKAY. GREAT.  SO SETH WILL BE OUR LAST QUESTION AND WE'RE GOING TO  MOVE TO WORKING ON THESE RECOMMENDATIONS.  ^^ THANK YOU. SETH SANDERS FROM CORNELL  UNIVERSITY. SO, JOHN, I HAVE THREE  QUESTIONS. I JUST WANT YOUR VIEWS ON THEM.  SO, THE FIRST IS -- HAS TO DO REALLY WITH NOT THE PUBLIC  TABLES BUT WHEN PEOPLE REQUEST SPECIAL TABULATIONS, WHICH I  THINK IS INEVITABLE, WHEN YOU NEED TO LIMIT THE PUBLIC DATA  MORE. AND I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION  IS, IS THERE ANY SENSE OF A SPECIAL TABULATION HAVING A  HALF-LIFE? WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS DO YOU  CONSIDER, ONCE YOU DISCLOSE A TABLE, THAT EVERYBODY IN THE  WORLD KNOWS THAT TABLE, AND SO HAS TO COME OUT OF THE PRIVACY  BUDGET, OR I WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE EVERYONE KNOWS EVERY  TABLE I EVER PUBLISHED BUT I GUESS FOUR PEOPLE DO OR  SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION.  THE SECOND QUESTION IS, HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT HOW TO HANDLE  WHAT I CALL THE OPTION VALUE OF DOING A SPECIAL TABULATION?  SO EVERY TIME YOU DO A TABULATION, IT MEANS SOMEONE  ELSE CAN'T DO A TABULATION. AND SO THAT PUTS YOU IN A  POSITION WHERE YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE, YOU KNOW, WHETHER YOU  DO TABULATION TODAY OR WHETHER YOU HOLD PRIVACY BUDGET FOR  SOMETHING YOU THINK IS GOING TO BE MORE VALUABLE IN THE FUTURE.  AND THE LAST QUESTION WHICH I KNOW JOHN, YOU'RE GOING TO  RECOGNIZE IMMEDIATELY, IS, YOU KNOW, IN THE ACADEMIC WORLD  THERE'S THIS IDEA THAT WHEN YOU HAVE DATA, THAT HAS BEEN  DITHERED, THAT IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO DO ANALYSIS AND  THEN SUBMIT THE ANALYSIS TO SAY AN AGENCY THAT HOLDS THE REAL  DATA, AND WHAT WOULD COME BACK WOULD JUST BE, WHAT'S THE  ACCURACY OF YOUR ANSWER? DOESN'T TELL YOU WHAT THE  ACTUAL ANSWER IS, BUT IT SAYS WHAT YOU GOT IS WHAT YOU WOULD  HAVE GOTTEN IF YOU USED REAL DATA.  SO I'M BRINGING THAT UP BECAUSE I THINK THE CONCERN I HEAR  AMONG A LOT OF CONSTITUENTS IS THAT FOR THINGS LIKE ALLOCATION  DECISIONS, WE MIGHT GET THE WRONG ANSWER.  AND SO, WHAT I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S AN ANALOGY TO A  VERIFICATION SERVER, WHERE THE BUREAU MIGHT PLAY THE ROLE,  THAT IF A DECISION IS MADE, THE BUREAU CAN SAY IF YOU USED THE  REAL DATA, YOU WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THE SAME ALLOCATION  DECISION.  THANKS, SETH.  SO, MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE, IF I WERE  TO GIVE SETH THE QUALITY ANSWER THAT HE DESERVES TO THOSE  QUESTIONS, YOU WOULD GET TO YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS SOMETIME  ABOUT 4:00 TODAY. SO, I'M GOING TO DELIBERATELY  GIVE SHORTER ANSWERS, AND INVITE FURTHER CONVERSATION  ABOUT THIS, EITHER IN THE WORKING GROUP OR IN A  SUBSEQUENT NAC. SO I'LL DO IT SHORT.  SHORT FORM. WITH REGARD TO SPECIAL  TABULATIONS, THE WAY WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THE ISSUE IS  THAT WE HAVE A PRIVACY LOSS BUDGET FOR THE 2020 CENSUS,  THAT NEEDS TO BE DOLED OUT OVER 72 YEARS.  AND THE LESS CURRENT THE DATA ARE, THE BETTER CASE YOU COULD  MAKE FOR SPENDING UP MORE OF THE PRIVACY LOSS BUDGET.  WITH RESPECT TO HALF-LIFE OF WHAT WE'VE PUBLISHED, THE WAY  SYSTEMS WORK, THAT DOESN'T MATTER.  THE PROTECTION IS AGAINST EVEN STRONGER TABLES THAN THE ONES  YOU RELEASED SO YOU DON'T -- IT'S CALLED RELEASE AND FORGET.  FUTURE PROOF. DUE TO FUTURE PROOF NATURE WE  HAVE TO THINK HOW TO DOLE OUT OVER 72 YEARS BUT DON'T HAVE TO  GIVE IT A HALF-LIFE. WE HAVE TO MAKE CHOICES WHO GET  THE PRIVACY LOSS BUDGET, TO YOUR SECOND QUESTION ABOUT THE  OPTION VALUE. AND THAT IS A QUESTION WE CAN  NOW TALK ABOUT EXPLICITLY, BASICALLY THE USER COMMUNITY,  SCIENTIFIC AND POLICY, HAVE DELEGATED CENSUS BUREAU FOR  DECADES WITHOUT REALIZING IT. IN FIGURING OUT THE PUBLICATION  STRATEGY FROM A CENSUS OR MAJOR SURVEY, YOU'RE INHERENTLY  LIMITING OPTION VALUE. NOW, YOU CAN GET SOME BACK BY  RESTRICTED ACCESS MODALITIES, AND SO THAT'S YOUR THIRD  QUESTION. I'LL GET TO THAT ONE.  BUT FOR AN EXAMPLE, IN THE 2010, 2019  CENSUS, WE NEVER PUBLISHED NATIONAL RESULTS, THE FULLY  ENACTED CONTINGENCY TABLE SHOWING EVERY POSSIBLE  COMBINATION OF OUTCOMES, NEVER PUBLISHED THAT.  YOU COULD GET CLOSE TO IT IF YOU USED THE PUBLIC USE  MICROSAMPLE, DID DETAILED FIVE-WAY OR SIX-WAY OR  SEVEN-WAY CROSS TAB. THAT WAS A CONSCIOUS DECISION,  BECAUSE THOSE ARE SPARSE POPULATIONS EVEN AT THE  NATIONAL LEVEL. WE'LL PUBLISH THE FULL  NATIONALITY RESULTS FROM THE 2020 CENSUS BECAUSE, YES, IF  THEY ARE SPARSE AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL THAT NUMBER WILL BE  NOISIER THAN OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN, THAT MEANS ANY  HYPOTHESIS INVOLVING TABULATION VARIABLES IS IN PRINCIPLE, ES TIM EIGHTABLE. ESTIMATABLE.  THE OTHER QUESTION, LET ME DELAY.  I PUT THAT IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS FINAL FORM OF ANY PUBLIC USE MICROSAMPLE.  THERE ARE THINGS THAT WILL FACILITATE USE OF DATA IN  CREATIVE WAYS WE DIDN'T ANTICIPATE.  SOME OF THOSE WILL REQUIRE VERY -- VERIFICATION SERVER, SOME  WON'T. ^^ WE CAN TALK OFFLINE.  I THINK WHERE I'M GOING IS THIS, THERE ARE COMMUNITIES  THAT ARE FEARFUL, THAT THE NEW PROCESS WILL AFFECT THINGS VERY  IMPORTANT TO THEM. AND I USE THE VERIFICATION  SERVER AS AN ANALOGY, THAT THE REAL QUESTION IS, YOU KNOW, IS  THERE SOMETHING LESS THAN RELEASING, YOU KNOW, THE EXACT  COUNT THAT COULD STILL ASSURE THE COMMUNITIES THAT THE  DECISIONS BEING MADE ARE MADE AS IF THE EXACT COUNTS WERE  RELEASED? AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS  LATER BUT I THINK IT'S SOMEHOW IMPORTANT, I DO FEEL IT'S  IMPORTANT THAT, YOU KNOW, WHEN WE -- AS SCIENTISTS, WE DON'T  JUST SAY WE CAN ASSURE YOU THAT WHAT YOU'RE GETTING IS RIGHT,  BUT, YOU KNOW, LIKE TRUST US THAT THE NUMBERS ARE CLOSE  ENOUGH. ^^ SO LET ME -- - JOHN ABOWD  AGAIN. CATEGORICALLY THE BUREAU IS NOT  ASKING ANYONE TO TRUST US. THAT'S WHY CONFIDENTIAL  PROTECTIONS ARE TRANSPARENT. WE'RE EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT  THE USE CASES MANDATED IN THE CONSTITUTION AND STATUTE, AND  WE INTEND TO DOCUMENT THE FITNESS FOR USE FOR THOSE USE  CASES. THE OTHER USE CASES THAT ARE  BROUGHT FORWARD BY USER COMMUNITY AND POLITICAL AND  OTHER INTEREST GROUPS, WE WILL CONSIDER AND PROVIDE TECHNIQUES  FOR DOCUMENTING. THE GOAL OF SCIENTIFICALLY  VALID CENSUS RESULTS IS SOMETHING THAT COMES WITH THIS  CONFIDENTIALITY PROTECTION SYSTEM.  AT A LATER NAC WE CAN TALK ABOUT OTHER THINGS WE'RE DOING  WITH THE 2020 CENSUS TO CONSIDER OTHER SOURCES OF  UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN CENSUS TAKING THAT NEED MORE  DOCUMENTATION. ^^ THANK YOU AGAIN.  ^^ GREAT. THANKS SO MUCH FOR ANSWERING  ALL THOSE, JOHN. WE HAVE -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  APPLAUSE. APPRECIATE THAT.  VERY INFORMATIVE. [APPLAUSE]  RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO -- THIS IS WHERE FOR THE NEW  PEOPLE WHERE THE MAD DASH BEGINS.  THIS IS WHERE WE TRY TO DO 52 RECOMMENDATIONS IN AN HOUR.  AND SO ONE MINUTE EACH. WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO, THIS IS  OUR PLAN, THAT WE STARTED DOING LAST TIME AROUND THAT WORKED  WELL, WE'LL WORK IN GROUPS TO WORDSMITH BASICALLY SO WE DON'T  DO SO MUCH ON HERE WHICH TAKES UP TOO MUCH TIME.  WE'LL DO THAT BASICALLY AND THEN DO THEM AS A GROUP FOR  APPROVAL. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE TEN MINUTES  UNTIL 1:00, TEN MINUTES UNTIL 1: 00, TO WORDSMITH.  EACH GROUP WILL DO 12. WE'LL DO 15 MINUTES, 1:05.  WE'LL DO THIS, YES? WE'RE TOTALLY GOING TO DO THIS.  LILY IS GOING TO BE OUR GROUP LEADER FOR GROUP 1.  GROUP 1 WILL CONSIST OF FIVE OF YOU.  LILY. CHILING, TAEKU, NICOLE, ANDRE A  ON 1-14. TWO APPROVED, SO ACTUALLY  TWELVE. CIRCLE AROUND EACH OTHER, START  WORKING. LILY IS THE SCRIBE, WE'LL TYPE  EDITS ON COMPUTER, THE REST HAVE PAPER COPIES.  NEXT GROUP, GROUP 2, WILL BE CHEROKEE, JOHN, STUART, AND  JIM. FOUR OF YOU WILL WORK ON 15  THROUGH 26. SOMEBODY WRITE THAT DOWN.  15 THROUGH 26. OKAY?  GROUP 3 WILL BE MYSELF, I WILL LEAD THIS GROUP, WITH YOLANDE,  BRAD, SETH, AND JERI. AND WE'RE GOING TO DO 27  THROUGH 40. REMAINING ONES, 41 THROUGH 52  LED BY MEGHAN, SO MEGHAN, CAROL, CHARLES, JAKE, CARLA.  ALL RIGHT? CIRCLE UP AROUND EACH OTHER.  THE PERSON I NAMED IS LEADER.  WE'LL TRY TO DO THIS IN 15  MINUTES. YES, MEGHAN, QUESTION? ^^ MAY BE ADDITIONAL ONES.  AS WE'RE WORD SHOPPING WE CAN PULL UP EXTRA ONES, OKAY?  ^^ ONE QUESTION. ^^ GROUP 1 WITH LILY 1 THROUGH  14. GROUP 2 OVER THERE WITH JIM  DOING 15 TO 26. GROUP 3 WITH ME DOING 27 TO 40.  MEGHAN'S GROUP IS DOING 41 TO 52.  ^^ QUESTION. FOR CLARIFICATION, I SUBMITTED  RECOMMENDATION NUMBER 11, AND IT'S NOW IN ANOTHER SECTION.  I WANT YOU TO DELETE THAT GROUP THAT HAS 1 THROUGH 14, DELETE  NUMBER 11. BECAUSE IT'S SOMEWHERE ELSE.  IT'S IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S PILE. [ MEETING IN GROUPS ] WE'RE AT THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING.  WHEN YOU'RE DONE E-MAIL TO CHAIRNAC@gmail. com. THANKS.  GO AHEAD AND TAKE YOUR  RECOMMENDATIONS, AND CUT AND PASTE THEM OUT, SO YOUR 12  RECOMMENDATIONS, OR LESS, TAKE THAT AND JIM ALREADY HAS HIS.  I GAVE HIM MINE. MEGHAN, IF YOU CAN CUT AND  PASTE TO AN E-MAIL TO JIM OR SEND THEM TO CHAIRNAC.  WE'LL COMPILE AND GET GOING IN A MINUTE.  WE HAVE 40 MINUTES TO APPROVE 50 RECOMMENDATIONS, AND WE'RE  GOING TO DO THEM ALL.  SEATS, WE'RE GOING TO GET  STARTED IN ONE MINUTE. ^^ EVERYONE, PLEASE TAKE YOUR  SEATS. THE SHOW IS ABOUT TO START.  ARE THEY ALL IN THERE?  LET'S SCROLL UP TO THE TOP. WE'LL GET STARTED. THE AMAZING TERRY WILL HELP ME.  SHE WILL SIT THERE AND DO OUR -- SHE'S JUST -- I DON'T KNOW  WHAT TO CALL HER, A WIZ AT DOING THESE CUT/PASTE/MOVE  THINGS AROUND, IN ADDITION TO AN EXTRAORDINARY LAWYER, A  PHENOMENON WITH THIS. WE'RE GOING TO MOVE QUICKLY  THROUGH THESE, SINCE MOST OF THE WORDSMITHING HAS BEEN DONE.  MY SUGGESTION, UNLESS THERE IS AN OBJECTION TO IT, WE'RE GOING  TO KEEP GOING AND DO A BIG SWEEPING VOTE AT THE END.  ARE WE OKAY WITH THAT? AS LONG AS YOU DON'T -- IF YOU  OCTOBER WE'LL STOP AND PAUSE. IF NOT WE'LL APPROVE EN MASSE.  ^^ SO FOR NUMBER 1, THAT WAS BASICALLY  GOING TO HAPPEN, WE APPROVED THIS.  THAT WOULD JUST ADD THAT LANGUAGE.  ^^ OKAY. WE'RE OKAY WITH THAT.  AND THEN -- OKAY. NUMBER TWO, THE NAC RECOMMENDS  DATA STEWARDSHIP COMMITTEE USE 100% COUNTS FOR AMERICAN  INDIAN/ALASKA NATIVE POPULATIONS FOR PURPOSES OF  FEDERAL ALLOCATION FORMULAS, THE UNITED STATES HAS A SPECIAL  TRUST RELATIONSHIP WITH FEDERALLY  RECOGNIZED AI/AN TRIBES COMMANDING THE HIGHEST LEGAL  AND MORAL OBLIGATIONS GROUND IN THE CONSTITUTION, SUPREME LAW  OF THE LAND, EARLY FEDERAL-TRIBAL TREATIES.  FROM NICOLE AND JAMES TOGETHER. EVERYBODY COOL WITH THIS?  AWESOME. SOUNDS FANTASTIC, DOESN'T IT?  OKAY. SO THEN WE'LL MOVE TO OUR NEXT  ONE. AWESOME.  NAP RECOMMENDS THE CENSUS BUREAU SHOULD KEEP NAC INFORMED  ABOUT HIRING LEVELS FOR TEMPORARY CENSUS EMPLOYEES BY  REGION AND ANTICIPATE NEED FOR GREATER RESOURCES, PAPER QUESTIONNAIRES, AND  ENUMERATORS. COOL WITH THIS? YES.  WORK WITH ALASKA FEDERATION OF NATIVE TO - TO PROVIDE  OUTREACH AND EDUCATION TO ALASKA NATIVE -- WE ALREADY  APPROVED THIS. MOVING ON.  ^^ HOLD ON, JULIE. THIS IS NICOLE.  ALASKA NATIVE NEEDS TO BE PLURAL IN THE SECOND TO THE  LAST SENTENCE. ^^ OKAY.  ALASKA NATIVES.  ^^ MISSING AN S. ^^ THANK YOU.  ^^ WE APPROVED THAT YESTERDAY.  NAC RECOMMENDS THAT IN ITS RECRUITMENT EFFORTS THE CENSUS  BUREAU CLARIFY FOR APPLICANTS THE MEANING OF "AUTHORIZED TO  WORK IN THE U.S." OKAY.  THERE'S BEEN CONFUSION ABOUT THAT.  SOUNDS GOOD. MOVING RIGHT ALONG HERE,  REQUEST FOR INFORMATION, NAC REPRESENTS CENSUS BUREAU  PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DETAILS REGARDING INTERNET CHOICE  OPTION FOR SELF-RESPONSE, PARTICULARLY REGARDING SPECIFIC  CENSUS TRACTS IN THE INTERNET CHOICE UNIVERSE AND RATIONAL  LANGUAGE DIGITAL DIVIDE, ET CETERA, LOW RESPONSE RATE  POPULATIONS SHOULD HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY AND CRITERIA  FOR INCLUSION AS INTERNET CHOICE CENSUS  TRACT, IN THE 2020 CENSUS CYCLE.  SO THIS IS WANTING TO HAVE PAPER AS OPTION EARLIER FOR  SELF-RESPONSE BASICALLY. JERI, THIS IS YOURS.  MICROPHONE, JERI.  ^^ I THINK THERE SHOULD BE SOME TRANSPARENCY IN EXACTLY WHAT  HAS GONE INTO DECIDING WHAT IS AN INTERNET CHOICE, GEOGRAPHIC  AREA, AND THAT THE BROADEST APPLICATION OF THAT BE APPLIED  TO COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY, NOT JUST RELATED TO  LANGUAGE BUT PERHAPS OTHER INDICATORS.  IF LANGUAGE IS AN ISSUE, THAT THERE BE -- WE KNOW THERE ARE  HAITIAN POPULATIONS IN FLORIDA, LARGEST POPULATION OF HAITIANS  IN FLORIDA, AND PROBABLY EXTREMELY LOW RESPONSE  COMMUNITIES THEY SHOULD HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY IF THEY  HAVEN'T ALREADY TO BE INCLUDED IN PAPER INTERNET CHOICE  OPTION. ^^ THIS LOOKS GOOD.  TERRY MENTIONED THIS LOOKS LIKE BOTH A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION  AND RECOMMENDATION, SO REQUEST FOR INFORMATION PART SEEMS TO  BE THE NAC REQUESTS CENSUS BUREAU PROVIDE ADDITIONAL  DETAILS RECORDING INTERNET CHOICE OPTION FOR  SELF-RESPONSE, AND SO ON, BUT YOU ALSO HAVE IN HERE  RECOMMENDATION, NAC RECOMMENDS ALL LOW RESPONSE RATE  POPULATIONS SHOULD HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY AND CRITERIA.  ^^ IF THERE'S A COMMON THRESHOLD FOR LOW RESPONSE, IF  IT'S A COMMUNITY THAT HAS LESS THAN -- 25% OR MORE, PERCENT OF  THAT POPULATION, DID NOT FILL OUT A CENSUS FORM IN 2010 MAYBE  THEY SHOULD BE PART OF THIS INTERNET CHOICE OPTION AS WELL.  WHAT GOOD ARE THOSE NUMBERS IF WE'RE NOT GOING TO USE THEM?  ^^ ARE WE OKAY WITH THIS AS A COMBINATION OF REQUEST FOR  INFORMATION AND RECOMMENDATION? YES?  ARE WE GOOD WITH HOW IT LOOKS? OKAY.  MOVING TO THE NEXT ONE. YEAH, WE'LL APPROVE AS WE GO  THROUGH AND CALL AN OFFICIAL VOTE AT THE END.  WE'RE APPROVING AS WE GO THROUGH.

WE COULD REMOVE THE -- ^^ SEEMS LIKE A GENERAL  GUIDELINE IF THE CENSUS BUREAU THINKS THERE'S AN ESPECIALLY  HIGHER HOMELESS POPULATION RECOMMENDATION SHOULD BE THEY  SHOULD WORK WITH THESE. ^^ FRIENDLY AMENDMENT.  WE'RE MOVING OFF THE 40,000, CONSIDER THE MAGNITUDE OF AREAS  THAT HAVE PEOPLE, SUBSTANTIAL PEOPLE.  ^^ I THINK THE CONCERN THERE WAS LIKE HOW DO WE -- I DON'T  THINK THEY ARE GOING TO SHIFT THE OPERATION ACROSS THE  COUNTRY, HOW DO WE SET A BASELINE, SOME PLACES WHERE YOU  JUST GOT TO DO THIS DIFFERENTLY BUT THAT NUMBER WAS TOTALLY  ARBITRARY. ^^ WHAT WOULD WE LIKE INSTEAD,  SUBSTANTIAL NUMBERS? WHAT DOES SUBSTANTIAL MEAN?  OKAY. ^^ PERHAPS "DENSE"?  I DON'T KNOW. ^^ MAGNITUDE OF AREAS THAT HAVE  SUBSTANTIAL POPULATIONS OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING --  SUBSTANTIAL POPULATIONS, HOW ABOUT THAT?  IT MIGHT VARY FOR COMMUNITY BUT BEING ABLE TO SORT OF DEPUTIZE  PEOPLE TO DO THIS, THAT WOULD BE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TOO MANY  PEOPLE FOR THE AMOUNT OF TIME. SUBSTANTIAL SEEMS FINE, YES?  ^^ I THINK MEGHAN'S CONCERN IF YOU SAY SUBSTANTIAL, IT MAKES  IT VAGUE ENOUGH. ^^ FOR THEM TO SAY, YEAH, WE  CAN'T DO THAT. SHE SEEMS WILLING TO -- THE  NUMBER COULD BE A DIFFERENT NUMBER, SO YOU COULD DROP IT  SUBSTANTIALLY, SAY 10,000. ^^ WHAT NUMBER WOULD YOU FEEL  COMFORTABLE WITH? ^^ OR LEAVE IT AND THEN --  ^^ YOU LEAVE IT, NOTHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN.  ^^ WHAT IF WE SAY TEN? THERE ARE MANY, MANY, MANY  CITIES THAT ARE VERY FAR UNDER TEN, AND JUST THE NUMBER OF  CITIES OVER TEN IS SMALL, SO EVEN IF WE SET TEN IT CUTS IN  DIFFERENT PLACE BUT KEEPS -- ^^ CAN I MAKE A SUGGESTION THAT  WE JUST SAY WHAT WE JUST SAID, WHICH IS IF THE BUREAU BELIEVES  THAT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO ENUMERATE THE NUMBER OF  HOMELESS IN THE THREE-DAY PERIOD THEY USE -- ^^ THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S -- THEY THINK THEY ARE DOING FINE.  THAT'S MY PROBLEM WITH IT. ^^ SORRY.  LET'S MOVE TO TEN. OKAY?  SOUND GOOD? ALL RIGHT.  ^^ JULIE, TEN-MINUTE WARNING. ^^ WE END AT TWO, RIGHT?  KAREN DOESN'T NEED TO SAY MUCH AT THE END.

LILY? ^^ IN ONE OF THE OTHER  RECOMMENDATIONS, THESE HAVE BEEN EDITED SO I DON'T KNOW  WHAT 11 AND 12 LOOK LIKE BUT WE DID MAKE RECOMMENDATION TO  INCLUDE SAMOAN AND TANGAN. ^^ I THINK THAT'S IN A LATER  ONE LOOKING AT -- WE CAN SAY ASIAN AND MENTION THE OTHER  ONES. WE HAVE TEN MINUTES LEFT.  LET'S DO THAT. NAC RECOMMENDS THAT THE CENSUS  BUREAU MATCH CURRENT NONENGLISH LANGUAGE COVERAGE IN EVERY MSA  TO IDENTIFY GAPS, THIS WOULD ADDRESS OMISSIONS LIKE NO  KOREAN OR JAPANESE BY A PARTNERSHIP SPECIALIST IN LOS  ANGELES.

COMBINATION OF MEGHAN AND JERI IN ONE.  ^^ I WOULD MAKE THIS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION, PROBABLY LABEL  IT A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. THAT'S WHAT IT IS I THINK.  ^^ I HAD ONE COMMENT. IT SAYS MOBILE QACs ARE NOW A  MAJOR PART. I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY HAVE  BEEN APPROVED OR FUNDED SO WE MAYBE WANT TO MODIFY THAT,  CONSIDERED AS A MAJOR PART. ^^ FIRST BACK TO JIM.  THIS IS A RECOMMENDATION. WE'RE RECOMMENDING THEY PROVIDE  THAT TO THE PARTNERS AND THESE OTHER PEOPLE, RIGHT?  REQUEST FOR INFORMATION, YOU TELL THE NAC SOMETHING,  RECOMMENDATIONS WE WANT THEM TO DO SOMETHING.  WE WANT THEM TO PRODUCE THIS INFORMATION AND PUT IT OUT  THERE. THAT'S A RECOMMENDATION.  I WANT TO TAKE REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OFF, DELETE THAT,  CARLA YOURS WAS -- ^^ JUST A SLIGHT CLARIFICATION  QUESTION, PERHAPS SLIGHT MODIFICATION, MOBILE QACs ARE  NOW A MAJOR PART OF THE 2020 CENSUS, I DIDN'T KNOW IF IT WAS  ABSOLUTELY A PART. IT'S A CONSIDERATION AND  CURRENTLY UNDER THE DISCRETION FOR FUNDING BUT I DON'T THINK  IT'S BEEN APPROVED. ^^ I THOUGHT CONGRESS DID  APPROVE FUNDING. AL, DID THEY NOT?

SO NAC RECOMMENDS CENSUS BUREAU  CONSIDER SHARING MEDIA BUY-IN WAS PARTNERS WITH BUDGETS TO  AVOID DUPLICATION AND ENSURE TRANSPARENCY AND CORRECT  IN-LANGUAGE USAGE ALLOWING LOCAL PROGRAMMING TO FOCUS ON  MORE LOCAL AND REGIONAL ETHNIC MEDIA.  I HAVE A STAR BECAUSE WE WEREN'T SURE THAT THE CENSUS  BUREAU CAN GO IN WITH OTHER OUTLETS AND I THINK YOU'RE  ASKING THEM TO BUY TIME COLLECTIVELY, I'M NOT SURE.  WE NEED SOME CLARITY. ^^ TO SHARE WITH LOCAL MEDIA  THAT ARE ALREADY DOING THE SAME THING SO YOU DON'T HAVE  DUPLICATION IN BOTH SPACES, ALLOWING FOR LOCAL MEDIA TO DO  DEEPER DIVES. ^^ SO NOT SHARING THE ACTUAL  BUY-IN, SHARING THE CONTENT. MAYBE TAKE THE STAR OFF.  ^^ THEY ARE SHARING THE BUYS IN DECEMBER, EARLY DECEMBER, LILY. ^^ HOW CAN WE MAKE THIS MORE  CLEAR? TAKE THE STAR OFF.  I JUST DID THAT TO MAKE US GO BACK. ^^ WE MAY NOT NEED THIS BECAUSE  THERE ARE ALREADY GOING TO SHARE MEDIA BIAS TO LOCAL LEVEL  IN EARLY DECEMBER. ^^ OKAY.  TAKE IT OFF THEN? OR LEAVE IT?  ^^ LET'S LEAVE IT AND SEE. IT WON'T HURT.  ^^ OKAY. LEAVE IT BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR.  I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANT, NIGHT DID -- NEITHER DID THE  REST OF THE GROUP. ^^ SHOULD IT BE TIME SPECIFIC  IN CASE TIMING SLIPS? ^^ THERE YOU GO.  ^^ I WANT TO ADD, I DON'T KNOW THAT WE WANT TO DO WHAT IT SAYS  BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE NAVAJO NATION, CENSUS BUREAU IS GOING  TO AIR ADS THERE BUT WE'RE ALSO AIRING ADS, THERE IS GOING TO  BE DUPLICATION BUT THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT.  ^^ SHE'S ASKING FOR NOT THAT THEY NOT DUPLICATE BUT SHARE  INFORMATION, RIGHT? I'M NOT SURE.  DO WE WANT TO TABLE THIS ONE? WE HAVE SIX MINUTES.  ^^ JIM, MAYBE EVEN CHANGE TO HELP AVOID DUPLICATION, WHERE  IT MAKES SENSE TO DUPLICATE IT'S FINE.  PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING OR DON'T WANT TO  DUPLICATE SHOULDN'T DUPLICATE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS  TO INFORMATION. ^^ I GUESS I WOULD CLARIFY IF  THERE'S A WAY TO CLARIFY FOR CENSUS TO SHARE INFORMATION SO  CBOs CAN MAKE A DECISION WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO DO  IT BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO DO IT IN PLACES LIKE ARIZONA, NEW  MEXICO, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S DUPLICATION.  ^^ IN SOME OTHER PLACES NOT HAVING TO SPEND MONEY TWICE  KNOWING THE CENSUS BUREAU IS ALREADY GOING TO DO IT, LOCAL  AGENCIES OR CBOs CAN FOCUS ON DOING A DEEPER DIVE WHERE THEY ARE LOCALLY.  ^^ NAC RECOMMENDS CENSUS BUREAU SHARE INFORMATION ON BUY-INS  WITH OTHER PARTNERS WITH BUDGETS TO ALLOW TO MAKE  INFORMED DECISIONS TO HELP AVOID DUPLICATION AND ENSURE  TRANSPARENCY AND CORRECT IN-LANGUAGE USAGE.  YES? OKAY.  PERFECT. NAC RECOMMENDS CENSUS BUREAU  ADD PSA FOR ASIAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY TO ATTEND TO  DIVERSITY AMONG THIS COMMUNITY. PSA FOR ASIAN-AMERICANS, WE GOT  ANOTHER ONE UP HIGHER ON THAT. MAYBE WE COULD TAKE THIS OFF  AND WE'RE DUPLICATING. LET'S TAKE THAT OFF.  WE JUST DID IT. TAKE THAT ONE OFF.  THAT DUPLICATED THE ONE WE JUST DID.  CENSUS BUREAU SHOULD PROVIDE BRIEFINGS AND PRESENTATIONS FOR  EACH TARGETED AUDIENCE BEFORE SHOWN NEXT YEAR.  OKAY. FINE WITH THAT.  NAC WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT DIFFERENT HARD-TO-COUNT  COMMUNITIES MAY BE WARY OF GOVERNMENT FOR DIFFERENT  REASONS, NAC RECOMMENDS RESEARCH OUT OF THE CBAMS TO  FOCUS ON RACIAL AND OTHER DIFFERENCES IN GOVERNMENT TRUST  THAT MAY SHAPE ATTITUDES, CATER TO SPECIFIC NEEDS OF THE  COMMUNITIES. OKAY.  APPROVED. COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP AND  ENGAGEMENT PROGRAM REFLECT LANGUAGE DIVERSITY DURING  OUTREACH, FOR EXAMPLE LOS ANGELES TO CONSIDER KOREAN,  JAPANESE, DIDN'T WE DO THIS ONE?  WE DID THIS.
