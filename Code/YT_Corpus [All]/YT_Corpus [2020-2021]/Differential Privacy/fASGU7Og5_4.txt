 In our work we present novel impersonation attacks on Bluetooth Classic, called BIAS attacks The Bluetooth standard provides authentication mechanisms Based on a long term pairing key, which are Designed to protect against impersonation attacks The BIAS attacks demonstrate that those mechanisms are broken And that an attacker can exploit them to impersonate Any Bluetooth master or slave device Let's see an example of slave impersonation The victims, Alice and Bob, share a long term key And support mutual authentication The attacker, Charlie, presents to Bob as Alice Downgrades Bluetooth mutual authentication to unilateral authentication Abuses Bluetooth role switching to become the new authenticator Authenticates Bob And starts a secure session with Bob as Alice Without having to authenticate As the BIAS attacks are standard compliant They can target any Bluetooth device In our experiments we attacked 30 unique Bluetooth devices For more details on the BIAS attacks read our paper and join our talk
