 We present PERUN: A new system for payment channels over cryptographic currencies. Blockchains do not scale. In fact, it can take several minutes until simple payments are confirmed. These delays and high fees prevent applications like high frequent microtransactions. Payment channels solve this scalability issue by moving the majority of transactions off the chain. Once a channel has been funded, parties can directly update its balance without additional blockchain transactions. These direct payments are extremely fast and cheap but opening a new channel still comes with fees and delays. We show how existing channels can be used to open and close new connections completely off-chain. In the talk, we will explain these virtual channels, their security and show why they are more efficient than existing payment networks.
