 and as in any election many coloradans are voting for the first time yeah more than 160 000 ballots returned from people 24 and under political specialist sean boyd joins us live now sean it is so great to see so many of our young people getting excited about casting their vote hey you know karen young voter turnout in colorado has historically been higher than that nationwide in part because of laws that require a ballot drop box on every college campus for example and allow 16 year olds to pre-register to vote when they get their license but this year young voters could turn out in record numbers almost half of all registered voters under the age of 25 in colorado have already cast their ballot including hundreds here at metro state university at metro state university 90 percent of the student body is now online because of covid19 but not even a pandemic will keep students here from voting i feel like it's important to vote because our like country just needs a lot of changes right now and like with the whole coronavirus it's really impacted my life she's in good company on this campus msu had the highest undergraduate voting rate in the country in a 2016 challenge involving 1 000 colleges and this year young voters are even more motivated turning out in record numbers in colorado and nationwide everybody i know that's my age is voting or younger is voting it's not just the presidential race galvanizing the millennials and generation z voters but issues like climate change gun control and racial justice jacqueline reese cast a ballot for the first time it's a lot going on that shouldn't be going on and a lot going on that i don't approve of so that means i need to get in there and vote denver clerk and reporter paul lopez says he's seeing a lot of first-time voters typically this is a demographic that is very unpredictable in terms of turnout but not this year we are seeing a lot of participation and that's a good thing studies show young people who vote are more likely to be engaged in their communities i just feel it in my spirit it's something i need to do msu says it is seeing 30 voters an hour at its voting center here inside the tivoli here and that's despite an empty campus the university has really continued to do a lot to engage those student voters including panel discussions online that have drawn upwards of 300 participants and of course postings on facebook and instagram and twitter we'll see if they keep their first place voter participation ranking this year live in denver sean boyd covering colorado first all right sean thank you
