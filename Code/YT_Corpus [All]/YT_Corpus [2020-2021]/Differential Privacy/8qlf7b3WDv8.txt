 hello, welcome to the talk preview of our paper deep learning techniques have led to breakthroughs in many artificial intelligence tasks unfortunately, existing DL models are inherently vulnerable to adversarial examples now, a myriad of adversarial attacks and defenses have been proposed but their strengths and limitations are still largely unknown in order to evaluate the existing adversarial attacks and defenses we present DEEPSEC which comprehensively and systematically integrates the state-of-the-art attacks defenses and relative utility metrics of them therefore leveraging the DEEPSEC users can measure the vulnerability of DL models evaluates the effectiveness of various defenses and conduct comparative studies on attacks and defenses in a comprehensive and informative manner for more details please come see our talks
