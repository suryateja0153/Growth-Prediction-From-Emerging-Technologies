 Mack theory Texas 20/20 special outreach to Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander populations all across the United States and in the territories we are webcasting today from the US Department of the Interior here in Washington DC my name is Tanya joshua deputy policy director here in the office of insular affairs we at the Department of the Interior have partnered very closely with the US Census Bureau and are pleased to host a webinar series on the upcoming dissemble census to be conducted on April 1 2020 the interior partners in this effort are the offices of smart fair and the office of Native Hawaiian relations the information we will be sharing is for all individuals will be considering the census however this series does have a specific focus on Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities also does all managers business secretary insular and international affairs would like to share the following remark and I quote I extend my wishes to all for a successful and informative series of webinars and trust that they will be useful it is vitally important for all communities to be counted wherever you reside in the US including in the US territories the census will inform our work in the federal government and impact the federal resources available to various communities please help spread the word in from your friends and neighbors and be counted in the upcoming census and now my colleague he walks along on the line I am Mahalo Tania I appreciate it Kareem colloid I am the director for the office in a defined relations here at the US Department of the Interior and I just wanted to take a moment to introduce our speaker today mr. Michael Hawes he's the senior advisor for data access and privacy at the US Census Bureau and he is responsible for the outreach and engagement with Census Bureau's data users on issues relating to the impact of privacy protection methodologies the accessibility and usability of census data prior to go to the census Michael served as the director of student privacy at the Department of Education where he was the department's senior policy official responsible for administration enforcement federal laws governing the privacy and confidentiality of additional education records Michael is also a member of the federal committee on statistical methodology and chairs the s CMS's confidentiality and data access committee Michael thank you I really appreciate you coming here today to share your expertise with us all right thank you chemo and thank you Tom yeah and I appreciate the Department of Interior letting me be here to speak with you about a topic that the Census Bureau cares a lot about today my wife don't appear to be showing us there we go all right so today I want to talk with you about privacy and the 2020 decennial census which we are in full swing down our first enumeration up and took sick bay and remote a lap and two weeks ago the official census day April 1st is coming up in just a short few weeks actually so this is an exciting time and privacy is a really critical really critical part of us conducting the census before I start just a few acknowledgments I want to thank my colleagues at the Census Bureau have contributed to what I have in my presentation today and just to say that any opinions and viewpoints in my presentation are entirely my own and do not necessarily represent the opinions or viewpoints of the US Census Bureau so the Census Bureau's commitment to privacy and confidentiality is absolutely critical to our ability to produce high-quality statistics about the nation's people and the nation's economy protecting the privacy of our respondents and the confidentiality of our respondents data is both a legal requirement for us and it's a core element of our institutional cultures formation that the Census Bureau collects or receives about our respondents is protected under Title 13 of the United States Code Census Bureau employees are sworn for life we take an oath of non-disclosure to safeguard our respondents information and the penalties for the unlawful disclosure of any identifiable information can include fines of up to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars or imprisonment for up to five years I know that's a penalty I don't want to have to face so we take that we take that legal obligation very seriously but our commitments to safeguarding the public's data aren't just about complying with the law it's also essential to ensuring the completeness and the accuracy of our statistics in an era of declining trust in government and of high profile data breaches that occur with ever greater frequency maintaining the quality and accuracy of our statistics would not be possible unless our respondents trust us to properly safeguard the information that they provide and we can't just consider the privacy threats of today when we publish our statistics we have to make sure under our legal and ethical obligations that the data are protected today and that they're protected against the privacy threats of tomorrow the challenge is that we collect all this information in order to fulfill our mission to produce quality statistics about the nation information tabulated from the decennial census is used for a wide array of purposes most people know that census data is used to apportion seats in the House of Representatives to draw district boundaries for federal state and local elections and to distribute over six hundred and seventy-five billion dollars each and every year but Census Bureau data are also routinely used for critical decision making at all levels of government and they enable policy makers businesses analysts and researchers across the country to measure and assess trends about who we are and where we are going as a society supporting these myriad uses requires publishing an enormous amount of statistics and tables often in very fine levels of granularity on grinding leery about geography is granularity about demographic groups etc fortunately we know that every time you publish any statistic that's calculated from a confidential data source you reveal or leak a tiny bit of private information in the process in 2003 and what later became known as the database reconstruction theorem des Noren the seam demonstrated that if you release too many statistics at too high a degree of accuracy you'll eventually reveal the entire underlying confidential data source and this challenge is even greater when you consider the privacy threats that we face today they say that nothing on the internet ever goes away and the same can be said for data once it's gone out into the wild over the past 20 to 30 years we've seen a massive proliferation of data that could potentially be used to re-identify individuals in our statistical data products data about us are collected all the time by the companies we interact with by data brokers and through social media not to mention the trove of personal information available on the dark web as a result of the countless data breaches that have happened over the years these data could be used in an attempt to pick out specific individuals in the data that we publish meanwhile technology has also improved computers can easily perform the complex matching algorithms that would be necessary to leverage external data in order to attempt to re identify specific individuals parallel trends are not abstract concerns they represent real concrete threats to protecting confidentiality that need to be addressed past century the Census Bureau has been a world leader in the design and implementation of the statistical methods that are used to safeguard privacy in public data releases as new privacy threats have been identified over the years the Census Bureau has worked diligently to improve our statistical safeguards to mitigate those threats back in the 1930s we realized that there was a great privacy risk in publishing data about small geographic areas so we stopped publishing many of those tables in the 1970s these concerns had increased and we had to suppress entire tables of our data products by the 1990s concern about Ryota fication of specific individuals led us to adopt a statistical method known as data swapping or record swapping where we would identify individuals or households who were at risk from a privacy perspective and swapped their records with those of the household somewhere else and now with the 2020 decennial census in order to counter the growing threats of the 21st century we're innovating yet again and we're adopting formal privacy or differential privacy which I'll talk more about in a few minutes first why is all this necessary what is the real risk here well there's a common misperception that when you aggregate data when you produce tabular results or totals of Statistics that aggregation of the data is sufficient to protect privacy while this may have once been the case and may still be true for some limited data releases it's no longer sufficient to protect privacy in large-scale statistical products in fact aggregate tabular data can often be thought of like a giant game of pseudo ku if you play Sudoku or familiar with it with Sudoku if you have enough numbers pre-populated into the grid and got a little example here on the right if you got enough numbers pre-populated into the grid then there's one and only one solution to the puzzle well the same goes with aggregate data table when you publish enough data tables when you publish enough statistics eventually there is one and only one set of individual level person records they could have yielded those aggregate statistics and while it might have seemed unthinkable a decade ago to be able to convert those those aggregate numbers into individual level records computer algorithms can now perform these types of reconstructions from aggregate tabular data quite easily so let's look at an example imagine that you collected some basic demographics about the seven people who live on a particular block you then want to publish some aggregate descriptive statistics about those individuals how many were female how many were black well the median age of married individuals and so on well with those basic aggregate statistics it's a trivial manner to solve for the only set of individual level records that could have yielded those results and I think trivial and I really mean it in fact it took a 2013 MacBook Pro laptop a grand total of zero point two seconds to reconstruct these individual level data from the data table on the Left our would be privacy attacker now has individual level records for everyone on that block but can she really really in them can she attach a name or figure out who they are well it turns out that this is also a relatively trivial exercise while the reconstructed individual level records did not have the specific individuals names they did have a number of pseudo identifiers that can be used to link those records to an outside data source that does have names in this particular example the attacker can use the age and facts of those individuals to match the reconstructed records to third party data say for example voter registration lists for that block now it's easy to attach a name to the records and you've just learned Jana Jo and John's race and relationship status so recognizing the growing threat posed by the proliferation of external data sources that can be used to attempt to redefine individuals and the increasingly powerful computer algorithms that can perform these analyses and actually conduct the reai defecation the Census Bureau recognized that traditional approaches to protecting privacy in our public data releases are becoming increasingly insufficient to protect our respondents privacy so to meet our continuing obligation to safeguard respondent information the Census Bureau has committed to modernizing our approach to privacy protections and has adopted differential privacy for the 2020 census so what exactly is differential privacy well differential privacy also known as formal privacy is a framework for quantifying the precise amounts of amounts of privacy risk or that private information leakage I mentioned earlier for every calculation every table every data product that we're going to public no matter what third party data are available out there no matter what kinds of computing power computing algorithms could be leveraged to attempt to reify those individuals said slightly differently formal privacy as an approach allows us to precisely measure and mitigate the leakage of private information in our published statistics it's a mathematically provable privacy guarantee that we can give to our respondents by quantifying that risk known in the differential privacy literature as the sensitivity of the calculation our query differential privacy allows us to mitigate the risk to an acceptable level by injecting precisely calibrated amounts of statistically neutral noise to our calculations what constitutes an acceptable level of privacy the only way to absolutely eliminate all privacy risk in a data set would be to never publish any usable data at all and clearly as the nation's leading provider of quality statistics about the nation not publishing data just simply isn't an option ports so Census Bureau policymakers have to find the optimal balance wherein we're providing data that are sufficiently accurate for all those uses that I mentioned earlier while also being sufficiently noisy sufficiently adjusted to meet our legal and ethical obligations to safeguard our respondents privacy and confidentiality that said once you identify that ideal point on the spectrum where the data are both accurate enough and sufficiently protected that point becomes known as your privacy loss budget and you'll often see this in discussions represented by the Greek letter Epsilon much like a monetary budget the lower your privacy loss budget the less privacy we're willing to give up an epsilon of zero would be the world of perfect privacy but completely useless data an epsilon and infinity would be the world of perfect data but no privacy protections at all so we've adopted differential privacy for the 2020 census because it's the only mathematically provable statistical approach to safeguarding privacy and confidentiality for our respondents but what is our adoption of differential privacy mean for the 2020 decennial census what does it mean for the data well for starters let me be absolutely clear that the Census Bureau's adoption of formal privacy will not alter our constitutional mandate to abortion leads for the House of Representatives the actual enumeration of state population remaining data products including the public law 94-142 will have privacy protections applied as they have in prior censuses only this time the noise will come from differential privacy rather than from the record swapping mechanism we used in the past switch to differential privacy does require us to reevaluate the quantity of the statistics and tables that we will be releasing as each additional statistic or table that we release uses up a fraction of that cost budget I mentioned earlier consequently the proposed suite of 2020 census data products will be somewhat different than in the past and if you want to learn more about those differences there'll be a link at the end of my presentation you can search 2020 census data products on our website or I believe one of my colleagues Rachel Marx will be giving another webinar on our data products later in this series if you want to know more about how we protect privacy how we protect confidentiality and how we're securing our information technology systems our IT systems for the decennial census there's a link here to our data protection webpage and there's a great little PSA video that linked there that goes into many of these issues in more detail the modernization of our disclosure going methods for the 2020 census has not been an easy undertaking this is cutting-edge technology and we're really excited to be to be deploying this on such a scale for the 2020 census but the growing vulnerabilities of traditional like as have meant that we needed to adopt a 21st century solution to counter these 21st century threats so it really is necessary and it's and it's worth the effort that we're putting into it the design and optimization of our disclosure avoidance methods is still ongoing and will continue over the the rest of this year if you want to learn more about this initiative the mechanisms involved the technology involved etc or if you to stay informed about design improvements to our differentially private algorithms please check out our disclosure avoidance in the 2020 census web page that I have linked here and if you're particularly data or computer savvy and you want to get under the hood of the algorithm so to speak you can find a link to the disclosure avoidance systems code base on that page - and we would love to hear from you if you have any suggestions for how we can improve it still further oh and with that I know we have some time left for questions so I'll turn things back over to Tonya to get the Q&A started thank you very much Michael appreciate that does anybody on the line have any questions but they would like to start off with while we're waiting Michael for any questions I actually have an observation there's always been a concern it seems the concern is the smaller populations and that is a privacy so as you know Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander populations are the smallest of all of the ethnic groups or groups that you're looking at in census so what what can you say about that particular population and and any products how do you balance that when the populations are small so that's an excellent question and it's one that we struggled with because it's quite often the the small populations the smallest population that most desperately need all of the data because they're often the populations that they need to be able to use that data to to argue for resources to argue for assistance to to be into numerous programs at the federal state local tribal levels so small groups need quality accurate data to go about their daily business but it's at the same time it's the small populations that are most risk from a privacy perspective because they're the ones that are most usually picked out in anonymizer or aggregated data because they don't share the same characteristics as the other people that were collecting data on so doing this balance of how do you produce accurate data for small groups while also sufficiently protecting privacy for those small groups has been a traditional and long-standing challenge for those in the federal government that produce and then apply as the digital safeguards to protect that data with differential privacy that challenge is still there but we are exploring a variety of ways to make sure that it where we're going to produce detailed high-quality data about small groups that are sufficiently accurate to meet federal program requirements to meet funding requirements to assist with grant application so if looking ahead and talking about sense the data products go ahead as we come out of the census year is it is it the case that you know I Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander community leaders who who are interested in particular data set they come and see the talk to the Census Bureau is there a place to absolutely manage that yes so as I mentioned during my talk because we're shifting our methods because we're deploying a different approach to privacy we are of necessity having to reevaluate which data products were going to release so what we produce for the 2020 census will not be the exact same slate of tables that would reduce the final list of those products has not been has not been finalized we have proposals for what we're planning on releasing but we are still accepting feedback on those and through the link that's on the screen right now on that page there's a link to what we labeled the 2010 demonstration data products which essentially were and release releases of the 2010 data or some of the 2010 data in the form that we're proposing those data were tapes for the 2020 census too a lot of people that have go in and see what they did right there and with that there is a website sorry an email address that concerned individuals that local leaders can respond to to provide input on what the tables they find most useful for their for their programs what this aggregations of population characteristics by sex by rings by detail rates by age by household status are necessary for the various uses to which they put the data so we are absolutely soliciting feedback from our data users on what they find most important and how they use our data because knowing how the data are being used will allow us to make sure that in those final data products that we released releasing the data that people need and that we're releasing and with sufficient accuracy to make sure that it meets their needs thank you very much Michael just as a reminder what I will be doing is we have a website page the office of insular Affairs does dedicated to this webinar series and we will be updating it this is just the look of it but there's the Intel and we will be updating in with today's presentations your contact information if that's ok motors and and Michael is absolutely correct on Thursday March 12 we will have a special webinar presentation arm census data products so that's very useful to know that for leaders community leaders to to reach out absolutely and Rachel marks my colleague will be giving that webinar is absolutely one of the people they interested parties would want to speak to about how they're using the census bear data because she she is right at the center of many of those decisions about which in what form are we going to be one thing that I said I thought was interesting in a conversation I had with you Michael was that we talked about economics and the census at least here in the 53 so the data that is released from from the decennial there is no economic data correction for for many people they think the Census Bureau and all the data that we release is from the decennial census and that's actually not the case it is our biggest endeavor certainly but the once every ten years decennial census only collect a few pieces of information about every division we collect who the individuals are their tactics their race their ethnicity and their council instruction there's a lot of other data that the Census Bureau is from other censuses and surveys they've goes into a lot more detail about economic issues participation in various social programs employments all of that those are not because if information that are collected or released as part of the decennial census the setting as I said identity later who you are your sex your race your ethnicity and how your household is may have and I just wanted to add that the census that will be conducted in the territories will be markedly different from the census in the 50 states so those of us who are in the 50 states in the mainland and Hawaii will have this abbreviated form as opposed to those who are in the territories and we will have a webinar discussion on that on that topic February 20 on Thursday always two weeks from now Porto Rico and that was - okay the 50 states DC and Puerto Rico are getting this will be similar the the island areas will will have a different concept okay great thank you does anybody have any questions no burning question take advantage of microwaves here if you're like me and you come up with a question right after the webinar ends my contact information is there and I believe Tommy will be putting it on the website I'm always happy to take questions it's do email or phone at a later date yes so thank you very much for joining us this is really an effort to help reach out to Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities in the United States and in the territories so thank you for joining us we will be having our next webinar will be next week on Thursday February 13 I know the time is not always convenient for people so we have as I displayed earlier that website page that can be used as a resource later we would invite you to visit it share that website page please everything links back to census gov so that you can have contact links to all the products that are available and we thank you very much for joining
