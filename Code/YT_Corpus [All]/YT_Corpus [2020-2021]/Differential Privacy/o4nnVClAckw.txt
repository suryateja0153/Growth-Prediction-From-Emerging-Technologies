 Modern systems for running general computations on distributed ledgers almost all work in the same manner: by re-execution. What this means is that to verify a transaction, every node in the network must re-execute every computation inside that transaction. This causes both scalability and privacy problems. The scalability issue is that, if your network contains devices which have different computing power, then you're now bottlenecked by the weakest node. The privacy issue is that each transaction reveals a lot of information about the executed program. This information is stored permanently on the ledger for anyone to see. To solve these issues, we developed ZEXE, which stands for Zero knowledge EXEcution. This is a ledger-based system that allows users to conduct arbitrary computations offline, and to then publish short transactions that attest to the correctness of these computations. We achieve very strong privacy and succinctness guarantees, so if you're interested in our system, please come to our talk!
