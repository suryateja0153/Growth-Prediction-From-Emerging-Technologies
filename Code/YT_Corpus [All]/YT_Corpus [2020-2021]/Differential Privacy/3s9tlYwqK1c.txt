 The rowhammer bug has been exploited to form a wide range of powerful rowhammer attacks. Although many defense techniques against rowhammer attacks have been proposed in recent years, as more sophisticated attacks are developed, the effective detection of rowhammer attacks remains a challenging problem. In this study, we propose a novel approach for rowhammer attack detection named RADAR, which stands for rowhammer attack detection via a radio. RADAR captures the electromagnetic emanations generated by the DRAM clock, and recognizes hammering-correlated side-band patterns in the spectrum of the signal to detect malicious hammering activities. As hammering-correlated side-band patterns are inevitable physical side effects of hammering the DRAM, they can help "expose" any potential rowhammer attacks. If you want to know more details about our RADAR approach, please attend our talk.
