 Redactable blockchain in the permissionless setting What's this all about? As you may know, blockchain allows storage of arbitrary data and sometimes these can be quite objectionable. Why is this a problem? Well, some jurisdictions around the world may be ok with it, while some others may forbid users from running the blockchain. Aren't there some solutions already? When you have a trusted authority, yes! But for permissionless setting like Bitcoin there is no solution yet. Tell me how you will solve it! We now have two link information instead of one and allow any user to request the removal of the objectionable content. Miners can now publicly vote or not vote for the request. If there are enough votes, the content is redacted. Well, but how do you ... Wait, wait, wait, save your questions for after my talk at Oakland. You bet I'll be there!
