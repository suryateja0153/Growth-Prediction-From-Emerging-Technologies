 in tech industry terms you know if the last decade was about digitizing healthcare the next decade is about making all that digital data good for something and that good for something is going to depend on data flowing where it needs to flow at the right time you're listening to the Microsoft Research podcast a show that brings you closer to the cutting edge of technology research and the scientists behind it I'm your host Gretchen using over the past decade the healthcare industry has undergone a series of technological changes in an effort to modernize it and bring it into the digital world but the call for innovation persists one person answering that call is dr. Peter Lee corporate vice president of Microsoft healthcare a new organization dedicated to accelerating healthcare innovation through AI and cloud computing today dr. Lee talks about how Ms R's advances in healthcare technology are impacting the business of Microsoft healthcare he also explains how promising innovations like precision medicine conversational chatbots & Asher's API for data interoperability may make healthcare better and more efficient in the future that and much more on this episode of the Microsoft Research podcast Peter Lee welcome to the podcast thank you it's great to be here so you're a Microsoft corporate vice president and head of a relatively new organization here called Microsoft healthcare let's start by situating that within the larger scope of Microsoft Research and Microsoft were at large what is Microsoft healthcare why was it formed and what do you hope to do with it it's such a great question because when we were first asked to take this on it was confusing to me healthcare is such a gigantic business and Microsoft you know the number that really gets me is Microsoft has commercial contracts with almost a hundred and sixty nine thousand healthcare organizations around the world it's just massive basically anything from a one nurse clinic in Nairobi Kenya to Kaiser Permanente or United Healthcare and everything in between and so it was confusing to try to understand what is such an adult of thinking to ask a researchy organization to take this on but you know the future of healthcare is so vibrant and dynamic right now and is so dependent on AI on cloud computing big data I think he was really wanting us to think about that future let's situate you okay you cross a lot of boundaries from pure to Applied Research computer science to medicine you've been head of Carnegie Mellon University's computer science department but you are also an office director at DARPA which is the poster child for Applied Research you're an ACM Fellow and on the board of directors of the Allen Institute for AI but you're also a member of the National Academy of Medicine fairly newly minted as I understand right just this year and on the board of Kaiser Permanente's School of Medicine so I'd ask you what gets you up in the morning but it seems like you never go to bed so instead describe what you do for a living Peter how you choose what hat to wear in the morning and what's a typical day in your life look like well you know this was never my plan I I just loved research and thinking hard about problems being around other smart people and thinking hard about problems getting real depth of understanding that's what gets me up but think the world today what's so exciting about it for anyone with the research gene is that research in a variety of areas has become so important to practical everyday life it's become important to microsoft's business not just Microsoft but all of our competitors and so I just feel like I'm in a lucky position as well as a lot of my colleagues I don't think any of us started with that idea we just wanted to do research and now we're finding ourselves sort of in the middle of things right well talk a little bit more about computer science and medicine how have you moved from one to the other and how do you kind of envision yourself in this arena well my joke here is these were changes that actually Satya Nadella forced me and it's a little bit of a joke because I was actually honored that he would think of me this way but it was also painful because I was in a comfort zone just doing my own research leading research teams and then you know such until it becomes the CEO Harry Shum comes on board to drive innovation and i get asked to think about new ways to take research ideas and get them out into the world and then three years after that i get asked to think about the same thing for healthcare and each one of those to my mind are examples of this concept that such it likes to talk about growth mindset I joke that growth mindset is actually a euphemism because each time you have to make these changes you just get this feeling of dread you might have a minute where you're feeling honored that someone would ask you something but then and boy I was you know on a roll in what I was doing before and you do spend some time feeling sorry for yourself but when you work through those moments you find that you do have those periods in your life where you grow a lot and my immersion with so many great people in healthcare over the last three or four years has been one of those big growth periods and do we recognize then let's say by the National Academies is sort of validation of that alright so rewind just a little bit and talk about that space you were in just before you got into the healthcare situation you were doing Microsoft Research we're on the spectrum from pure like your Carnegie Mellon roots to applied like your DARPA roots did that land there's an organization called NExT here I think right you know when I was in academia academia really knows how to do research yeah and they really put the creative the graduate students and the faculty at the top of the pyramid socially in the university it's just a great set up and it's organized into departments which are each named after a research area or a discipline in within the departments are groups of people organized by sub-discipline in their area and so it's an organizing principle that's tried and true when I went to DARPA it was completely different the departments aren't organized by research area they're organized by mission some easily accessable goal or objective you can always answer the question have we accomplished it yet or not and so research at DARPA is organized around those missions and that was a big learning experience for me it's not like saying we're going to do computer vision research we'll be doing that for the next 50 years it's can we eliminate the language barrier for all internet connected people that's a mission you can answer the question you know how close are we right and so the mix between those two modes of research from academia to DARPA is something that I took with me when I joined Microsoft research and you know Microsoft Research has some mix but I thought the balance could be slowly different and then when Satya Nadella became the CEO and Harry Shum took over our division they challenged me to go bigger on that idea and that's how NExT started. NExT tried to organize itself by missions and it tried to take passionate people and brilliant ideas and grow them into new lines of business new engineering capable for Microsoft and along the way create new CVPs and TFS for our company there's a tension here because one of the things that's so important for great research is stability and so when you organize things like you do in academia and in large parts of Microsoft research you get that stability by having groups of people devoted to an area we have for example say computer networking research groups that are best in the world and they've been stable for a long time and you know they just create more and more knowledge and depth and that stability is it's just so important you feel like you can take big risks when you have that stability when you are a mission oriented, like in NExT, these missions are coming and going all the time so that has to be managed carefully but the other benefit of that management wise is more people get a chance to step up and express their leadership so it's not that either model is superior to the other but it's good to have both and when you're in a company with all of the resources that Microsoft has we really should have both well let's zoom out and talk somewhat generally about the promise of AI because that's where we're gonna land on some of the more specific things we'll talk about in a bit but Microsoft has several initiatives under a larger umbrella called AI for good and the aim is to bring the power of AI to societal scale problems in things like agriculture broadband accessibility education environment and of course medicine so AI for health is one of these initiatives but it's not the same thing as Microsoft healthcare well the whole AI for good program is so exciting and I'm just so proud to be in a company that makes this kind of commitment you can think of it as a philanthropic grants program and it is in fact in all of these areas providing funding and technical support to really worthy teams passionate people really trying to bring AI to bear for the greater good but it's also the case that we devote our own research resources to these things so it's not just giving out grants but it's actually getting into club relations what's interesting about AI for health is that it's the first pillar in the air for good program that actually overlaps with a business at Microsoft and that's Microsoft Healthcare one weight I think about it is it's an outlet for researchers to think about what could a I do to advance medicine when you talk to a lot of researchers in computer science departments or across Microsoft research labs increasingly you see more and more of them getting interested in healthcare in medicine and the first things that they tend to think about if they're new to the field are diagnostic and therapeutic applications can we come up with something that will detect ovarian cancer earlier can we come up with new imaging techniques that will help radiologists do a better job those sorts of diagnostic therapeutic applications I think are incredibly important for the world but they are not Microsoft businesses so the AI for health program can provide an outlet for those types of research passions and then there are also as a secondary element four billion people on this planet today that have no reasonable access to health care AI and technology have to be part of the solution to creating that more equitable access and so that's another element that again doesn't directly touch Microsoft's business today in Microsoft healthcare but is so important we have a lot to offer so AI for health is just I think incredibly visionary and wonderful program for that well let's zoom back out No let's zoom back in I've lost track of the camera I don't know where it is let's talk about the idea of precision medicine or precision healthcare and the dream of improving those diagnostic and therapeutic interventions with AI tell us what precision medicine is and how that plays out and how are the two rather culturally diverse fields of computer science and medicine coming together to solve for X here yeah I think one of the things that is sometimes underappreciated is over the past 10 to 20 years there's been a massive digitization of health care in medicine after the 2008 economic collapse in 2009 there was the ARRA there was a piece of legislation attached to that called the high tech act and high tech actually required healthcare organizations to digitize health records and so for the past 10 years we've gone from something like 15% of health records being in digital form to today now over 98% of health records are in digital form and along with that medical devices that measure you have gone digital our ability to sequence and analyze your genome your proteome have gone digital and now the question is what can we do with all the digital information and on top of that we have social information yeah people are carrying mobile devices people talk to computers at home people go to their Walgreens to get their flu shots and all of this is in digital form and so the question is can we take all of that digital data and use it to provide highly personalized and precisely targeted diagnostics and therapeutics to people can we get a holistic kind of 360-degree view of you specifically of what's going on with you right now and what might go on over the next several years and target your wellness can we advance from sick care which is really what we have today to healthcare when a big tech company like Microsoft throws its hat in the healthcare ring and publicly says that it has the goal of transforming how healthcare is experienced and delivered I immediately think of the word disruption but you've said healthcare isn't something you disrupt what do you mean by that and if disruption isn't the goal what is right you know healthcare is not a normal business worldwide it's actually a seven point five trillion dollar business and for Microsoft it's incredibly important because as we were discussing it's gone digital and increasingly that digital data and the services and AI and computation to make good use of a data is moving to the cloud so it has to be something that we very close attention to and we have a business priority to support that but you know it's not a normal business in many many different senses as a patient people don't shop at least not on price for their health care they might go on a website to look at ratings of primary care physicians but certainly if you're in a car accident you're unconscious you're not shopping you're just looking for the best possible care and similarly there is a massive shift for healthcare providers away from what's called fee-for-service and towards something called value-based care where doctors and clinics are being reimbursed based on the quality of the outcomes what you're trying to do is create success for those people and organizations that let's face it they've devoted their lives to helping people be healthier and so it really is almost the purest expression of Microsoft's mission of empowerment it's not how do we create a disruption that allows us to make more money but instead you know how do we empower people in organizations to deliver better and receive better healthcare today in the u.s. a primary care doctor spends almost twice as much time entering clinical documentation as they do actually taking care of patients some of the doctors we work with here at Microsoft call this pajama time because you spend your day working with patients and then at home when you crawled to bed you have to finish up your documentation that's a big source of burnout oh yeah and so what can we do using speech recognition technologies natural language processing DIYer ization to enable that clinical note-taking to be dramatically reduced you know how would that help doctors pay more attention to their patients there is something called revenue cycle management and it's sort of sometimes viewed as a kind of evil way to maximize revenues in a clinic or hospital system but it is also a place where you can really try to eliminate waste today in the US market most estimates say that about a trillion dollars every year is just gone to waste in the US care system and so these are sort of data analysis problems in this highly complex system that really require the kind of AI and machine learning that we develop and those are the kinds of disruptions we'd like to see that's right yeah well all them successes as you did well and there are disruptions though other disruptions that help today's working doctors and nurses they help today's hospital administrators let's talk about several innovations that you've actually made to help support the healthcare industries transformation last year a year ago at the hims conference you talked about tools that would improve communication the healthcare experience and interoperability and data sharing in the cloud tell us about these innovations what did you envision then and now a year later how are they working out yeah maybe the one I'd like to start with is about interoperability I sometimes have a joke that it's the least sexy topic but it's the one that is I think the most important to us in tech industry terms you know if the last decade was about digitizing healthcare the next decade is about making a Ledge digital data good for something and that good for something is going to depend on data flowing where it needs to flow at the right time and doing that in a way that protects people's privacy because health data is very very personal and so a fundamental issue there is interoperability today while we have all this digital data it's really locked into thousands of different incompatible data formats it doesn't get exposed through modern api's or microservices it's oftentimes siloed for business reasons and so unlocking that is important one way that we look at it here at Microsoft is we are seeing a rising tidal wave of healthcare organizations starting to move to the cloud probably 10 years from now almost all healthcare we'll be in the cloud and so with that historic shift that will happen only once ever in human history what can we do today to ensure that we end up in a better place ten years now than we are now in interoperability is one of the keys there and that's something that's been recognized by multiple governments the US government through the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has proposed new regulations that required the use of specific interoperable data standards and API frameworks and I'm very proud that Microsoft has participated in helping endorse and guide the specific technical choices in those new rules so what is the API that Microsoft has so the data standard that we've put a lot of effort behind there's something called fire fhir fast healthcare interoperability resources and for anyone that's used to working in the web you can look at fire and you'll see something very familiar it's a modern data standard it's extensible because medical science is advancing all the time and it's highly susceptible to analysis through machine learning and so it's utterly modern and standardized and I think fire can be a lingua franca for all healthcare data everywhere and so for Microsoft we've integrated fire as a first class data type in our cloud in Azure we've enabled fire in office so the team's application for example can connect to health data for doctors and nurses and there's integration going on into dynamics and so it's a way to convert everything that we do here Microsoft into great healthcare capable tools and once you have fire in the cloud then you also suddenly unlock all the AI tools that we have to just enable all of that precision medicine down the line it's such a biblical reference right then the cloud in the fire you know there's an endless supply of bad puns or on fire and say oh thank you for contributing today well it makes you think about the fire festival which was spelled FY re which is the biggest debacle in festival history I should say by the way another thing that everyone as Microsoft should be proud of is we have really been one of the chief architects for this new future one of the most important people and the fire development community is Josh Mandel who works with us here at Microsoft healthcare and he has the title chief architect but it's not chief architect for Microsoft it's chief architect for the cloud oh my so he spends time talking to the folks at Google AWS at Salesforce and so on because we're trying to bring the entire cloud ecosystem along to this new future tell me a little bit about what role BOTS might play in this arena bots are really interesting because how many listeners have received a lab test result and have no idea what it means how many people have received some weird piece of paper or bill in the mail from their insurance company it's not just medical advice you know where you have a scratch in your throat and you were worried about what what you should do now that's important too but the idea of bots in health care really span all these other things one of the most touching in a project led by Hadassah patron and her team has been in the area of clinical trials so there is a website called clinical trials.gov and it contains a registry describing every registered clinical trial going on so now if you are desperate for more experimental care or your doctor treating someone and you're desperate for this you know how do you find out of thousands of documents and they're complicated right technical measures things yeah and it's difficult if you go to clinical trials.gov and type into the search box breast cancer you get hundreds of results so the cool project that had us and her team lead was to use machine reading from Microsoft Research out of Haiphong Poon's team to read all of those clinical trials documents and create a knowledge graph and use that knowledge graph than to drive a conversational chat bot so that you can engage in a conversation so you can say you know I have breast cancer I'm looking for a clinical trial and the chat bot will start to ask you questions in order to eventually to the one or two or three clinical trials that might be just right for you and so this is something that we just think has a lot of potential yeah and business-wise there are more mundane but also important things just call centers boy those nurses are busy mmm what would happen if we had a bot that would triage and tee up some of those things and really give superpowers to those call center nurses and so it's that type of thing that I think is very exciting about conversational tech in general and of course Microsoft Research and NExT should be really proud of really pioneering a lot of this mod technology so if I employed a bot to narrow down the clinical trials could I get myself into one is that what you're explaining here yeah in fact the idea here is that this would help tremendously the connection between prospective patients and clinical trials it's so important because pharmaceutical companies and clinics that are sitting up clinical trials more than 50% of them fail to recruit enough participants they just never get off the ground because they don't get enough the recruitment problem is so difficult Wow and so this is something that can really help on both ends I didn't even think about it from the other angle like getting people in I always just assumed well a clinical trial no biggie it's such a sad thing that most clinical trials fail and fail because of the recruitment problem huh well let's talk a little bit more about some of the really interesting projects that are going on across the labs here at Microsoft Research so what are some of the projects and who are some of the people that are working to improve healthcare in technology research yeah I think pretty much every MSR lab is doing interesting things there's some wonderful work going on in the Cambridge UK lab in Chris bishops lab they're in a group being led by a dictionary one of the things there has been a set of projects in collaboration with Novartis really looking at new ideas about a our molecule design for cellular therapies as well as very precise dosing of therapies for things like macular degeneration and so these are sort of bringing the very best machine learning and AI researchers shoulder-to-shoulder with the best researchers and scientists at Novartis to really kind of innovate and invent the future in the MSR India lab serum Raja Monty's team they've been standing up really impressive set of technologies and projects that have to do with global access to healthcare and this is something that I think is just incredibly incredibly important you know we really could enable through more intelligent medical devices for example much less well trained technicians and clinicians to be able to deliver healthcare at a distance the other thing that is very exciting to me there is just looking at data you know how do we normalize data from lots of different sources and then MSR Asia and Beijing they've increasingly been redirecting some of the amazing advances that lab is famous for in computer vision to the medical imaging space and they're just amazing possibilities in taking images that might not be high-resolution enough for precise diagnosis and using AI to kind of magically improve the resolution and so just the cross board is you go from kind of lab to lab you just see some really inspiring work going on yeah some of the researchers have been on the podcast antonio crimini see within ER I haven't had a Ethan Jackson from premonition ya know the premonition well internet community and the work that he led an inner eye you know we actually went all the way to an fda 510 K approval on the tumor segmentations and the components of that now are going into our cloud really amazing stuff yeah and then premonition this is one of these things that is in the age of coronavirus the thing that is so important is we talked of precision medicine before but there is also an emerging of precision population health and in fact the National Academy of Medicine just recently codified that as an official part of medical research and it's bringing some of the same sort of precision medicine ideas but to population health applications and studies and so when you look at premonition and the ability to look at a whole community and get a genetically precise diagnosis of what is going on in that community it is something that could really be a game-changer especially in an era where we are seeing more challenging infectious disease outbreaks I think a lot of people would say can we speed that one up a little I want you to talk for a minute about the broader tech in healthcare ecosystem and what it takes to be a leader both thought and otherwise in the field so you've noted that we're in the middle of a big transformation that's only gonna happen once in history and because of that you have a question that you asked yourself and everyone who reports to you so what's the question that you ask and how does the answer impact Microsoft's position as a leader right you know healthcare in most parts of the world is really facing some big challenges it's at a financial breaking point and almost all developed countries the spread of the latest access to good medical practice has been slowing in the developing world and as you kind of look at how to break out of these cycles increasingly people turn to technology and the kind of shining beacon of hope is this mountain of digital data that's being produced every single day and so how can we convert that into what's called the Triple Aim of better outcomes lower costs and better experiences so then when you come to Microsoft you have to wonder well if we're going to try to make a contribution how do you do it when such an Adele has to stick this on we told ourselves a joke that he was throwing us into the middle of the Pacific Ocean and asking us to find land and because there's just such a big complex space where do you go and we had more jokes about this because you start swinging for a while and you start meeting lots of other people who are just as lost and you actually feel a little shame to feel good about seeing other people drowning but it fundamentally doesn't help you figure out what to work on and so we started to ask ourselves the question if Microsoft were to disappear today in what ways with health care be harmed or held back tomorrow and into the future if our hyperscale cloud words disappear today in what ways would that matter to healthcare if all of the AI capabilities that we can deploy so cheaply on that cloud were to despair how would that matter and then since we're coming out of Microsoft Research if Microsoft Research were to disappear today in what ways would that matter and asking ourselves that question has sort of helped us focus on the areas where we think we have a right to play and I think the wonderful thing about Microsoft today is we have a business model that makes it easy to align those things to our business priorities and so it's really a special time right now well this is not to change tone really quickly but this is the part of the podcast where I asked what could possibly go wrong and since we've actually just used a drowning in the sea metaphor it's probably apropos but when you bring nascent AI technologies and I say nascent because most people have said even though it's been going on for a long time we're still in an infancy phase of these technologies when you bring that to health care and you're literally dealing with life-and-death consequences there's not any margin for error so I realized sit the answer to this question be too long for the podcast but I have to ask what keeps you up at night and how are you and your colleagues addressing potential negative consequences at the outset rather than waiting for the problems to appear downstream that's such an important question and it actually has multiple answers maybe the one that I think would be most obvious to the listeners of this podcast have to do with patient safety medical practice and medical science has really advanced on the idea of prospective studies and clinical validation but that's not how computer science broadly speaking works in fact when we talk about machine learning it's really based on retrospective studies you know we take data that was generated in the past and we tried to extract a model through a machine learning from it and what the world has learned in the last few years is that those retrospective studies don't necessarily hold up very well prospectively and so that gap is very dangerous it can lead to new therapies and diagnosis that go wrong in unpredictable ways and there is sort of an over exuberance on both sides as technologists we're pretty confident about what we do and we see lots of problems that we can solve and the healthcare community is sometimes dazzled by all of the magical machine learning we do and so there can be overconfidence on both sides that's one thing that I worry about a lot because you know all over our field not just all over Microsoft but it costs all the other major tech companies and universities there are just great technologists that are doing some wonderful things and are well intentioned but aren't necessarily validated in the right way and so that's something that really is worrisome going along with safety is privacy of people's health data and while I think most people would be glad to donate their health data for scientific progress no one wants to be exploited exploited for money or worse you know denied for example insurance and you know these two things can really lead to outcomes over the next decade that could really damage our ability to make good progress in the future so that said we're pretty good at identifying the problem we may be able to start a good conversation air quotes on that but this is for me like what are you doing yes this is a huge thing and I really think for real progress and real transformation that the foundation says be right and those foundations do start with this idea of interoperability so the good thing is that major governments including the US government are seeing this and they're making very definitive moves to foster this interoperable future and so now our role in that is to provide the technical guidance and the technologies so that that's done in the right way and so everything that we at Microsoft are doing around the interoperability around security around Identity Management differential privacy all of the work that came out of Microsoft research and confidential computing all of those things are likely to be part of this future as important as confidential computing has been as a product of Microsoft research it's going to be way way more important in this healthcare future and so it's really up to us to make sure that regulators and lawmakers and clinicians are aware and smart about these things and we can provide that technical guidance what about the other companies that you mentioned I mean you're not in this alone and it's not just companies its Nations and I daresay rogue actors that are skilled in this arena how do you get sort of agreement and compliance I would say that Microsoft is in a good position because it has a clear business model if someone is asking us well what you can do with our data we have a very clear business model that says that we don't monetize on your data but everyone's going to have to figure that out also when you are getting into a new area like healthcare every tech company is a big complicated place with lots of stakeholders lots of competing internal interests lots of politics and so Microsoft I think is in a very good position that way to we're all operating as one Microsoft but it's so important that we all find ways to work together one point of contact has been engineered by the White House and something called the blue button Developers Conference so that's where I am literally holding hands with my counterparts at Google at Salesforce at Amazon at IBM and making certain pledges there and so the convening power of governments is pretty powerful it's story time we've talked a little bit about your academic and professional life give us a short personal history where did it all start for Peter Lee and how did he end up where he is today well let's see so I'm Korean by heritage I was born in Ohio but Korean by heritage and my parents immigrated from Korea my dad was a physics professor he's long retired now and my mother a chemistry professor Wow and she passed away some years ago but I guess as a an Asian kid growing up in a physical science household I was destined to become a scientist myself and in fact they never said it out loud but I think it was a disappointment to them when I went to college to study math and then maybe even the bigger disappointment when I went from math to computer science in grad school of course they're very proud of me now where'd you go to school I went to the University of Michigan I was there as an undergrad and then I was planning to go work after that I actually interviewed at a little tiny company in the Pacific Northwest called Microsoft and but I was wooed by my senior research advisor at Michigan to stay on for my PhD and so I stayed and then went from grad school right to Carnegie Mellon University as a professor and then worked your way up to leading the department yes I was there for 24 years there were wonderful years a Carnegie Mellon University is just a wonderful wonderful place and I was like there's a pipeline from Microsoft Research I remember as an assistant professor when Rick Ratched came to my office to tell me that he was leaving to start this thing called Microsoft Research and I was really sad and shocked by that now Here I am well tell us if you can one interesting thing about you that people might not know I don't know if people know this or not but I have always had a interest in cars and fast cars I spent some time when I was young racing in something called shifter carts and then later in open-wheel Formula Ford and then when I got my first real job at Carnegie Mellon and I had enough money that I spent quite a bit of it trying to get a sponsored ride with a semi-pro team I never managed to make it it's hard just kind of split being an assistant professor and trying to follow that passion you know I don't do that too much anymore once you are married and have a child the annoyance factor gets a little high but it's something that I still really love and there's a community of people of course I place like Microsoft it's really passionate about cars as well as we close Peter I'd like you to leave our listeners with some parting advice many of them are computer science people who may want to apply their skills in the world of health care but are not sure how to get there from here we're in the vast sea of Technology and healthcare research possibilities should emerging researchers set their sights and where should they begin their swim you know I think it's all about data and how to make something good out of data and today especially you know we are in that big sea of data every one of them has different formats different rules most of them don't have modern api's and so things that can help evolve that system to a true ocean of data I think anything to that extent will be great and it is not just tinkering around with interfaces it's actually a I to say normalize the schemas of two different datasets intelligently is something that we will need to do using the kind of latest machine learning latest program synthesis the kind of latest data science techniques that we have on offer who do you want on your team in the coming years the thing that I think I find so exciting about great researchers today is their intellectual flexibility to start looking at idea in getting more and more depth of understanding but then evolved as a person to understanding you know what is the value of this in the world and understanding that that is a competitive world and so how willing are you to compete in that competitive marketplace to make the best stuff and that evolution that we are seeing over and over again with people out of Microsoft research it's just incredibly exciting when you see someone like a Gailen hunt or a Doug Berger or Lily Chang come out of Microsoft research and then evolve into these world leaders in their respective fields not just in research but spanning research to really competing in a highly competitive marketplace dad is the future Pete Earley thank you for joining us on the podcast today it's been an absolute delight thank you for having me it's been fun to learn more about dr. Peter Lee and how Microsoft is working to empower healthcare professionals around the world visit microsoft.com/testlabguides
