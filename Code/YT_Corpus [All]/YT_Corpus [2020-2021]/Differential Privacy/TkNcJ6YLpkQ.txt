 it's been a kind of banner year for me at events similar to this so this group I will say I give you credit in how you've assembled us because I fear some of what I'm saying will be a little too obvious to you because in other instances it's a bunch of entrepreneurs here just saying yeah we're just gonna go for it and I think the healthy skepticism in the room is awesome and forgive me if it's a little too obvious but we'll see okay so nonetheless right pretty straightforward people still want to invoke as we've heard in different ways today innovation everywhere and certainly the deference to new technology I think is fading there are new concerns I think there's some old responsibilities and I think there's still this basic notion of how do you create value and maintain trust and success so I'm hoping that we'll be able to go through some issues about how law and data driven innovation intersect and then do a couple deeper dives forget-me we already talked about it all right so one thing that comes out of certain literature's in business is the notion that businesses want to think about a triple bottom line that it's not just profits but actually believe it or not a fairly robust conversation about the notion of how what one does affects people and the planet I'd like to suggest part of the reasons for this some really great work from awhile ago now 2004 talked about the ideation of co-creation of value that that the firm is becoming a locus of value creation and value extraction the question that we're seeing is well maybe that hasn't worked the way people hoped in other words people are voting with wallets I think the the last panel the fact that the cities and larger governmental entities are using their market power to say guess what we actually want something different right there is a big deal but absolutely what's almost too obvious in the Bay Area the way we make goods matter right it's going to influence the global marketplace it has political implications and now we're seeing some very active law and policy come out but just as a side note to remind every we're seeing all sorts of fascinating questions in business in general right food production marriage equality gun ownership Delta got into a very interesting fight with the the legislature in Georgia because it chose to suspend a very small subsidy to a few members of the NRA and boy for a pro-business state there was a real back-and-forth there between the state willing to actually try and fight back in a way against corporations obviously uber the hold elite uber question interesting questions about strikes Facebook as someone said today almost unfortunately a continual case study in how perhaps not to run a corporation Wells Fargo let's not forget a good old-fashioned less obvious tech issues with Wow we were incentivized it seems or if no one was at the wheel and we're gonna continually come up with fraud Amazon UK the question of taxation does matter as was brought up right our companies actually part of what's going on and are they paying their fair share more specifically though right a frontier for both the intersection of legal social political and commercial is data privacy and AI or m/l I want to do a little history remember why data from my perspective this goes back to early days of search and money some of you in the room remember these companies right scale is expensive google studies a little company called overture and realizes hey that text ad thing might work they borrow it shall we say and all of a sudden the mantra of wow with data I can generate money becomes a huge spillover right it's not just Silicon Valley every company out there starts to believe with more data I will find more and new things and I will monetize it but I want to suggest that as I think people in the room would get one problem or at least a possibility that we're seeing is that the over claimed benefits of innovation especially from this city across the bay and all the way down to Santa which by the way when people talk about just bopping around the Bay Area I mean 50 miles come on it's far it's empty right first of all remember the word innovation just means new it does not mean good that's it it could be a big innovation a little innovation it may or may not go anywhere but again there's this all these recent examples so Google at one level is an interesting study too because one person put it to me this way look if you want to do incredible innovation on a piece of software and some of the backend stuff they're also still very very good at that but somehow they don't seem to always click on the full consumer side but to be more specific let's take a look at the Facebook mistakes in the last part of the year right so it turns out they're sharing data with Spotify and Netflix now let's suppose I was a sort of person who takes pictures of my food now I'll be honest I haven't been on Facebook for about two years but let's say I uploaded that and it also was oh I happen to like hip hop evolution which as a side note I highly recommend fantastic series the problem is what am I gonna get a recommendation for something I don't care about Indian hip hop right it's just ridiculous your big innovation is oh yet another ad about something that you may or may not have cared about and of course the answers if you gave us more data we'd be even better at peering into your brain and we know what you want autonomous vehicles much higher stakes right same problems who's got the data where are you monetize it is someone going to be recognized or not and run over Melinda Gates it helps to be a billionaire to be able to say this but still right let's do something more than just a new little app let's shoot for bigger innovation the thing is no matter what we can still have a trust problem so something that motivated me here as was alluded to earlier today the notion of algorithmic transparency many CS people I know were sort of in the don't want to talk to you you guys are idiots I'm out of here I was like well why it's because of the talking past each other now one thing that came up with something that mentioned like there's this thing where we're devoting ourselves oh my god the temple of algorithms and software and data Wow but it's on both sides because sometimes it's like a bad version of Star Wars help me obi-wan with your technology well okay but you just said technology is killing us pick one maybe or realize it's not the technology as you Vaughn said it's us nonetheless if we start to be more skeptical and more honest about the technology if we realize it is not dark magic we might be able to start to say well what do we want but in case someone in the room doesn't think that this is happening at scale across the country right the privacy project the New York Times is very clearly saying what is going on and people are starting to pay attention as mentioned earlier the GDP are very strict about EU about data use in the EU sometimes I have heard people argue they're weak they're obviously not innovative it's a trade issue they just don't like the way America wins problem hello California yet again the land of Silicon Valley has said no to data huh no think about it they both have this big implication so what's going on what's the often a counter-argument as was we heard before you're against innovation or the more subtle version we increase consumer welfare in other words stuff will be cheaper but will it we don't know where's all the wealth going if you're a company you're also a little trapped now because here's what we've also been taught you can maybe get away with all sorts of flaunting the law you might get caught right oxycotin maybe VW in Germany and other German automakers are a very good lesson but maybe not this because at the same time with our own areas right in the tech world uber lyft Airbnb scooters flaunting the law like crazy getting to scale and then someone tries to close the door and fix it so if you're someone like even Marriott you're actually thinking I need to go head-to-head but you don't know what to do because you're an old-school company you don't want to be that but you also realize wait to get up there I'm gonna have to break things so that's your current mindset evolve with data in technology or Die right by the way if you go to the Google campus and see that t-rex the whole point of that is not we're scary it's allegedly just like a t-rex we could be evolved out of existence keep change going but that's invaded everything and maybe people need to go this way instead yes evolve yes compete but build trust into what you do so how does that work alright simple overview there's a lot of stuff that does show that in fact big data analytics the precursor to really the underlying guts perhaps to a lot of the discussions now about software algorithms machine learning etc does work right there are really great things look as much as we want to pick on these companies perhaps Google still really improves the amount of information we get right Facebook for all of its issues there's still lots of people who really are connecting to each other albeit just simple things right try and budge a family member off of Facebook know I get to see my grandkids and the dogs and I'm happy and I'm connected I know what they're doing right so there's data security there's privacy and there's discrimination quick point on security my colleague Peter Swire who if you don't know and if you're interested in security of privacy is fantastic a super expert I like it I don't know if he coined it but the mmm the hard and crunchy exterior maybe that's a term of art but you know there are things you should be doing and I think the the folks at the cities and otherwise are getting this right you know you got to segregate you got to know what's going on you got to show me you've got real security and look at the costs and benefits of do you really need all that data all the time so privacy is still out there doing a lot of work we're gonna have a whole bunch of issues with Fair Information practices and re identifications so interestingly Phipps is born here in the US in the 70s it's the Europeans who grab it and do more with it right it's not that it went away but they did now we've got this huge jump with the GDP are right you can get fine for real four percent of global revenues for any company but it's certainly some of the big players is a lot of money some have suggested that this could end up being the end of using data analytics as we know it will see as a more simple thing suppose you do want to be global what we do it doesn't fit very well in that sense right we have to limit our collection we have to be specific and as we talked about today that's tricky because guess what if you want to be able to say I only wanted my data used for X Y Z explain to me how if I'm the company that had your data that I don't super tag it so that I can then delete it that's actually really tricky and some of the best pieces of security that I'm aware of called hashing and distributing means and having redundancies in your data center makes it extremely difficult to comply with delete all my data those two clash and as much as I don't think it's fair to say the Europeans are all insane I do think there's a lot of aspirations that run right into each other and that's just how they play the game by the way and then they want to sort it out after the okay so one of the classic retorts though it's anonymous okay but maybe not right there's the baseline remember if you've actually got the obvious things name identity number address phone number you're pretty much identifying but can you de-identify as some of you know not so much very difficult especially when you've got really cool large data sets there have been pretty good papers out there that show the records a medical records database gender date of birth zip code seems anonymous turned out no we were able to figure out another piece short piece I wrote with a friend of mine one of the great things about Georgia Tech is I get to work with computer scientists who know way more than I the unfrozen caveman lawyer right so here's gdpr legal gobbledygook roughly do doesn't apply to anonymous information and it's great you can use it looks like a good carve out that sort of compromises maybe we were thinking of for statistical or research purposes more simply okay if you've got this aggregated data and it's not directly linked identifying data so there's not a known systemic way to re-identify it and it doesn't relate you could be good to go it seems then if hey I'm using it for statistical purposes and I've got anonymity turns out we're not positive what that looks like under GDP are yet but maybe right if we're in the game we're going whoa whoa whoa this is beautiful I'm okay I've got machine learning people I've got it is set and I can anonymize like crazy it turns out what my colleague was starting pointed out and we why we wrote our short paper was look there's this thing called memorization it's a caching mechanism allows recall and it turns out that what she was reminding everyone and I helped hopefully put over the line was this deep learning algorithms can can you can Social Security numbers we can figure out stuff and as I said before early work shows that you can recommender systems leak information across users and boom we're through we wrote this not as a gotcha it was a warning that even in good faith within a discipline especially one as varied in technique as machine learning you could think you're doing okay and Allison found out you've stepped on a mine or to be differently if you're working with a bunch of technologies engineers I'm innovative and I've got really cool math my mouth proves everything and what you need to do is say oh yes it does however I need to know more okay so again probably super familiar to you everyone good and bad discrimination right efficient scoring I don't think anyone in this room would actually say if we were running a bank it's insane to try and figure out credit risk failure the question is how right that's where it gets very tricky garbage in garbage out so how many people are aware of the whole story about pothole app Boston okay so Boston had an app that was again super well intentioned will detect potholes now unfortunately and this is where I get a little upset with some of my colleagues in academia there's two different ways the story's been told one was and then it turned out it only detected the rich white neighborhood so obviously that was bad well okay the the follow-up in in I believe was Kate Crawford's work pointed out and very quickly Boston figured that out that's important Austin was working with I believe Boston University and really good data science people they visualized it and it turns out really quickly if you're not remember where we started going is I bow down to the gods of Technology and their apps and we go wait wait wait let's put up a map let's use that data for us I think oh hey there's only potholes in the rich neighborhoods just say that out loud right it's one of the things I tell my students when you want to make a really cool assertion just say it out loud and double check like hey does that sound right I don't think so and visualize it and guess what they very quickly like Oh well it turns out that we had a couple problems I believe one of them was manhole covers because of the depression looked like a pothole because it was a sensing device right so the app itself was getting kind of like when you know where you are well it was picking up on the bounce and then yes it turns out that people who lived in poor neighborhoods were not as likely to have the app or turn it on but they actually quickly figured it out as far as I know and kept trying to improve now we can say hey there's a surveillance issue there's other issues true but the point is you can get really stupid feedback loops if you don't understand the nature of your data and you don't continually Aude it and look at it you cannot just defer to it and that's why the point that was made by Yvonne really resonated with me and I think I'm super impressed with the last panel it's you've got to keep doing your job if you blame technology over and over I think then you and I are to blame together so how did that work Tess the outcomes right inside the industry or if you're buying software say I want to see this thing and I want to have ways to double-check what it's doing right I think that is simply good business at this point don't just launch it a lot of times what's probably happening is super cool lab innovations are being done someone puts out a paper right they go to things like if you're familiar with ngerous and all these really fancy high-end machine learning conferences let's just say call it that if you don't know what it is that's fine but then the industry folks are sniffing around going hey what's the latest thing and they buy it right that's what happened with you know small group gets bought by Google for absurd money and then goes to feats go sorry we're done it goes to feats goes that's really poor English oh well moving on point is maybe it wasn't ready for primetime that was probably relatively benign it's a game but in other cases maybe it should be whoa whoa whoa what what we need to double check as industry is what did the science paper say science papers should hopefully be saying well we had a limited set of data we were doing it for this context but we're moving so fast it's voice recognition everywhere someone might go well why as people said you can have internal ethics review boards why not we've got cities organizing that where it's people who are doing it on volunteer time I'm sorry you're a hundred million or multi-billion dollar company can you not figure this out can you not pay someone internally now let's be honest it's easy to say oh that's easy to do the flipside having been inside a company that's not a happy spot inside the company it's really hard because you're now seen as lawyers are always seen and anyone who's saying no or let's stop and think you are hurting the company and slow you down turns out yes we're slowing things down but you use the cases that are out there now there's a ton of them Oh would you really like to spend another year and a few hundred million dollars on developing that product that was gonna die within 24 hours of launch hello Google Buzz right you might get people to realize no it is actually us trying to build something so that everyone will win including all the time that money you're spending but it probably has to happen with good product counsel early someone who is part of the team but just enough away to ask those weird questions in specific cases you want to double-check right so if you're in a sensitive area the law is actually saying guess what if you're doing lending housing employment you have to pay attention one of the weird things about a lot of companies I will say is they think that because they're cool and disruptive in their origins that somehow doing something that has been around a long time like lending makes them new and you have to actually go well well actually there's a law on this it turns out and while your technique is new the notion of lending is not one of the things that my colleague Josh Kroll and I put together then was the notion of technical accountability right so a lot of people have done really good work about the problem of not having political accountability because these systems are hard to understand or they weren't built with input but the other piece of this is maybe it turns out that if you start to build software from the beginning with an eye towards letting someone poke at it it will actually be something that adds a society we can say good go for it and if there's a lawsuit we'll be able to say oh did that work the way we hoped it would or not was there a design flaw one of the big friction points right now in other words is the notion of algorithmic transparency is somewhat waved off I think less so now because computer scientists can say with truth and math it turns out if you hand over code you'll never be able to prove it never will do X or Y this is how they look at the world it I took me a long time but when I heard this one five or six different computer scientists in roughly was well dub and everyone knows in a complex system and then at that point I don't know what they were saying but I actually wrote it down and what they were really doing was quoting a thing or channelling a thing called Rice's theorem but then I said well wait you guys work with that problem you can't tell me you're launching code from a really big company and you're not sure if it's gonna work right oh no no we work within that I'll turn like well then what do you do that's the moment where I urge you if you want to be involved with policy don't only go after them with pitch forks and knives listen to how they look at the world because it turns out with most engineers in my experience two tips get two of them in the room if there's one they'll say you're dumb possibly think you're an idiot and you don't understand the math why do I talk to you if there's two of them and you say I don't know if I can do this one of them will see it as ooh I can outdo that other engineer because that's that's the war mindset it's I'm a problem solver set it up as a problem not as a know and explain what the coolness of solving the problem is you're now in engineering land and it's a good land there's probably a deep reason why you know Indians are like you must be a doctor engineer well guess what if you've got a lot of people you want to have health and you want to build things I it's a good civil profession it's well-intentioned really right put it together get your engineers chow to them in a positive way you usually get good outcomes in my experience it may be they haven't thought of that before because yes there's a tunnel vision okay break it now the hard part is certain techniques in fact are not amenable to being understood and then I have said in the paper with Josh which have set some people I don't think you get to use those for sensitive things if you're determining who gets welfare rights or other things where we need due process and you're telling me what my deep learning system is so awesome and it really was better that's like yeah but maybe better here means I still don't get to use it that's a social choice for us it means that in fact we could have a world where fewer people get the obvious good benefit but because we're choosing a other value of we need to be able to probe it for when it goes wrong we go slower in how society moves forward one of the things I proposed was a whistleblower statute because it turns out if someone's actually building software with evil nefarious intent one of the best things you can do is have someone who says hey I that was really bad I've also proposed a Public Interest cause of action so for things like autonomous vehicles and voting machines maybe we have people out there probing systems as much as they can kind of like a bug testing solution and then they get to go just California is famous for this one of the everyone prop 65 you've seen the signs folks that is actually if I'm not mistaken an early key Tam law which means if you as a citizen want to say this may have some problem you can then get your own lab and you can go to this government and say I believe we should you should go after this they get a chance to decide if they want to take the case and if they don't then you bring your own case we could start to do that for technology I think it's tricky there's a lot of layers here in terms of making sure you don't have fraudulent cases what certificates of Merit expert panels it's possible so here's the thing which all of you are thinking about I think there I did it again too when he goes too many things will we start to see a cut-off of data flows perhaps there is genuinely a question about that happening under GDP are in that sense could it be that Europe will actually give up on what we take for granted maybe but the National privacy law question is fascinating will it have less teeth than California history of political maneuvering likely but not 100 percent clear to me which way that's going to break in either way it might still slow things down or change up the game in short I think the deference to industry is ending we do need trusted systems I think industry should take the lead and start to build this way because that would actually show genuine deep good-faith they can understand the problem ex-ante get out there ahead of it test it show that they tested there's still be mistakes and the government might start to pass even more laws to make sure bad actors are discovered and prosecuted now here's the thing does that mean innovations over no because if it's a law for everyone guess what everyone now gets to innovate on being more trustworthy on building software that we can actually play with in a way that matters and it turns out there's a technique called zero knowledge proof that my colleague again it's great to work with CS people who know what they're doing it's a theory but it might be that you could build software in such a way that if we in outside of computer science are saying we want the software to work within certain parameters what write what engineers want is a clear specification and that's why fairness has so much trouble good luck defining that in a way that works for an engineer it's not going to happen but if you have a clear specification it was a great I'll build to that and it turns out their techniques that say I can even prove to a third party here's the punchline without giving away the secret sauce you don't necessarily have to hand over code in a zero knowledge proof if this holds up this could be very promising right so much to have make that work this is not pie in the sky folks for things that are already out there I'm far as I know not gonna work easily new software however could be built with this in mind to say great I can prove to you I can have a third party who can poke at it and say yep they did what we were asked them to does it mean it will not do things we didn't want doesn't mean as a society will still beat not be upset but it means we can at least start to say hey did you do certain things a certain way oh yeah in simplest terms something I wrote in 2008 and then published in 2009 having to do with early versions of embedded medical devices I think it's still right the notion of co-creation of value is this stop treating people as a resource stop saying you sign the contract and we can do what we want it's an error these are the practices where all of a sudden and it doesn't matter right away government university researchers industries everyone can actually start to give trust that science and history is in fact doing progress for all instead of progress for a small group and with that I'm done questions that was 662 soft slides and we still have 20 minutes before drinking hmm yeah it's a great question I think it's the same problem as fairness in a way because I haven't made one get my arms around what would be properly transparent to your point I think engineers have some really good ideas my bet is from a legal perspective what motivated one of the papers was this lawyers love to believe that engineers are building this building that you built it you must have a blueprint we can look at it and we can all understand it and then I talked to people who are doing really cool computer science and they're like no in good faith we're not positive what how that works and how it came out the other end and so I don't know what transparence in that in that world I mean if you've got that background I think it I would love to know what you think frankly because I think one level would be that's why the third-party testing is promising if it works it's a little bit of you know oh so data one of the things people are looking at is think of your whole pipeline of what you did right the data where where it came from darris a harvested I'm kidding no where was collected the Providence in that sense if you start to label it I think at every stage where there's a major possible question the more you can show that you've got a step towards the type of transparency whether you can hand that over well you know that that is a secret sauce problem Yeah right the other you know who's gonna make sense and fast right yeah I'm transparent so I it's okay by the way if something goes wrong right right no I think that that was another motivator was there's some interesting literature out there about open source can do a lot but it won't necessarily solve some of the demand current legitimate questions that are happening about the nature of transparency right so yes that the hey just be transparent and it's like again is that really gonna get you anything it would be like a bad it's a bad fig leaf right it's oh yes I handed it off you have no idea what I did anyway [Music] yeah yeah that's a great point I said I'd heard about this I'd forgotten the name of that but they are trying to work on that I think again the context as an example I think it's it Richard Karuna I believe his name really great stuff and I was out of this conference where I was like oh wow he said you could use this sort of opaque machine learning trans technique but it turns out that when he reduced it to basically forgive me if I'm getting it wrong and if Richard sees this my apologies but um a type of decision tree which was really easy to understand but then I shared it with other people that I can't but that's only thirty features right and so what they were trying to say to me is look context matters in the health context where he was doing that you didn't need as many features but you know Google Ads Facebook news all those the number of things that are behind those it's you know the phrase two to three hundred signals at least it's not gonna work according to some people maybe I'm wrong but the model cards is an interesting way to say look we can actually give you pretty high confidence about what we're doing how we're building it and what's happening so thank you that's I need to actually fit it there's always that question of do your homework and do your reading a bit more question no more questions [Music] yeah no that's great so a few things there I think was Chris's talk that that noted that for a quick second this is another moment where I get to celebrate one of my good friends and colleagues Pierce wires work he's got a whole group there's there's a few other people who also do this on cross border data yeah if you could type Peter Swire cross border data there's a whole webpage on this I've had the privilege to work with him a little I actually wrote a quick paper and the communications ACM right when I left Google about this question and I said companies can no longer stick their head in what I call the data SAN because it used to be my servers are in Ireland so I'm governed by Ireland and good luck and I like yeah I don't think that's gonna hold up much longer and it turned out very quickly people were like saying that the hard part here is Europe is a really big market so if a bunch of companies want to comply and put stuff within Europe and in fact it turns out when you're doing distributed computing which is another way of saying cloud stuff for both security and other reasons that'll work put servers all over manage it like an energy grid actually and you're within the EU you're good to go relatively small countries would pose an interesting question here too right so now if you want to do data localization in say Vietnam or Ecuador how does that work maybe a few big players can afford that too but there's some trade-offs there but then the third piece that you got to that Peter illustrates I think really nicely is imagine you're in the police department in Paris and there's been a serious enough crime that you find out that this person had email that was served by a US company well our current system is called the mutual legal assistance treating I did this when I was in practice that thing is not designed for today that's for really big crime it's where you go through mmm sieze and it takes oh gosh I mean it can be six months - I think maybe higher average was a year or more that's not tenable with the amount of actual evidence that a local government has genuine claim to a little bit of I think your wavelength there so what what Peters working on and I hope the project continues is frankly it's probably scary to folks but it's a way to say what does process look like in a given country does it map what we would want here to actually allow our companies to comply with the request for data now of course people get nervous with that right because what's the country asking but there is a way to make this work and I think this is a different tack on your gut point which is there's a legitimate need to get access to that data for a whole bunch of reasons it could be to fight literally good old-fashioned crime and if I'm in France I might be like what do you mean you can't go after these folks you've got the evidence no it's stuck somewhere in Mountain View or you know Kirkland or whatever so so there's a lot of layers to what's going on with gdpr interestingly my impression is other countries are following that lead whether anything would happen with China I don't know but I doubt it right I mean that's a whole other game and and so the Mozilla normal mantra is most likely going to be we're about openness and we don't like Dana localization so stop it but I think if you were here he might say yeah but of course there's a problem with what does that mean in Russia versus China but I don't know you know I don't want to speak for Chris but it's it gets really weird but I think subset Internet's are likely in the future is my bet yeah [Music] what's the one thing that you can anticipate where surveillance and it's to be 19 degrees around mm what's up 15 years we just went to the old place and blasted see our lessons as losses both so I'm anticipating I was aware of sensors what should we be preparing or because I feel like as which is really great San Francisco people in country doing that flower movie slow and very much fun because this is like you know what the most effective me say for any engineers building a prospectus the company's working because I feel like well I think part of what I would say is yes you're correct and I'm gonna actually defend the engineers and at this point because think back to what it looked like 15 years ago the the ability for this to alson turn into these very different applications was not really an inkling maybe and I think this is going to be the most interesting moment for the profession right the I Triple E I was part of their one of their first major new statements on ethics and I think that's getting much more crisp the explosion of ethics courses at in engineering programs this year I think someone did a quick review and it might be more than 150 200 different syllabi you know work like what's going on at Santa Clara so that's step one getting engineers to think in those terms but again I really hope we don't get smug about put yourself inside the company it's hard as you point out to slow down things when you're told build this thing right so it's almost too easy to say the Manhattan Project I don't want to do that in hindsight right but the thing is this doesn't feel like wow what energy did I just unleash so I would imagine if I were an engineer I'd be whiplashed in the sense of that one that I want to stop and slow down and really be thoughtful in another level is it really gonna be that big and another level you know my boss said good morning why I haven't finished writing my code or my team right so that's where maybe part of the structures are inside the company right the the higher level review boards the people who are embedded with the team it's up to the people it really is look not to enter where human beings were broken from the beginning it's really hard to do the right thing all the time let alone figure out what that is but not asking the question not continually trying to get the question somehow right is probably the bigger mistake in my opinion I'll tell you honestly that dates back to a high D garyun thing that I picked up in Berkeley but that's the basic coach question why must I be that was this professor who I used to drive my actual ECS roommate crazy just pacing around the house what is that what is it to be me in this world as an engineer as a person how am i doing something is there a moment where I if I'm an engineer like you you can start to see some of the horizon of the application and say is that where it's headed is there something I can do can I raise a flag side note to junior engineers especially do not buy into the lifestyle keep a cash reserve because if you really really don't think your company is doing right no easy exit is real walk out but if you've got a cash in the bank to have a few months rent and to be able to find that new job in the interim you could get people to go with you right right now engineers should have a lot of power in this part of the country because there's a absolute lack of labor talent allegedly if that's true that's why labor can organize right now at big companies but then doing it in a way that's really thoughtful what does that look like are you really saying well it has to look like this political outcome or that political outcome that I don't know like I'll give you an example from search when Google started to hand-tuned search boy they made a mistake from one perspective which was now everyone says we know what the outcome of search should be but those of you who do computer science and think about the nature of information provision I don't know what exactly it could come out I know that there are things that are hateful that I don't want there but that's not the same as saying I know what search should look like right and think about it on a political spectrum there's things in the middle where people truly disagree does that mean they don't get to see the people with whom they agree be some people don't like them I think God I'm not the one making that decision but those are really weird questions but those are the good ones for engineers to have and to say maybe we don't hide behind free speech at every moment because it's it's a nifty move but think about it if we ask Twitter or as someone to start to control that stream we've now hand it off a huge political thing to a private entity we don't have a good answer here right so this is where the big questions and this is where Rachel forgive me we're going way off here but the door is open okay so how many people think we should break up the big tech companies okay that's fine what do you think you'll get out of that other than Wow we broke them up because they're big and powerful excuse me so that that's a great point right so in the best deference to this this is a good traditional move in antitrust right Ma Bell good old AT&T broken up and we did get interesting competition regional of course what happened in the long run we now have a few big players again whether that's the nature of certain industries I leave to others but you can guess that I'm thinking yeah maybe but intact would you have multiple search engines guess what we do would you have more than one Facebook explain how the network effects work Google has been trying to build a social network for more than 10 years they have the money they have the skills no one's moving thank you good point so you could try and split them but to what end here's my counterpunch to break them up we used to have a thing in this country where we would be able to tell all right for all of us old folks in the room there were three networks plus PBS and what used to happen as a kid I want my cartoons no I had to watch all the conventions for both parties and the debates and all the way through the political because that was their job and we had a doctrine that said you have to do that because you have the great privilege of reaching the American people once we got cable once we got abundance in the end of what was scarcity of spectrum that went away what we might be seeing is a different way of talking about power concentration what people point out do we want to treat these companies as a public utility but think about that that would then mean Facebook gets to be the social network roughly speaking Google gets to be the search engine I have also written about this it's a trade-off and then there's that moment this is what I meant by I get really frustrated by all tech bad look at them oh no save us well which is it which do you want because we could do it right monopolies in big verticals they'll make a ton of money they don't want this by the way because in the long run that makes them a utility but maybe they're fine right Google's pretty clever they've they're basically throwing off all that public utility touchdown money to all the other alphabet companies very clever move right because now you can you can say these are the companies doing the things that we're not sure whether they'll become huge but the main company is doing just fine the stock market gets much happier when that happens it seems right but do we really want that do we want G or if the fact though that's that maybe we bite the bullet and say great here are your rules then we're back to what do those rules look like are we really going to let politicians decide and remember whichever party you like isn't always in power and there's a long history when we had those three of a lot of mischief about what it meant could carry certain things under the old system of the three networks so when people are really excited for breaking up things that cetera it's like yeah that felt good and I think the better question was to what end what do you get out of that time for us to go drink sorry I want two seconds this is for our organizers thank you for getting this to work [Applause]
