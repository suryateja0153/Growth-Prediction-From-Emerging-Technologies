 Phishing attacks continue to be a major threat to modern Internet users despite the ubiquity of defenses such as browser blacklists. Attackers seek to circumvent blacklists by using cloaking techniques such as these to hide phishing sites from security infrastructure while keeping them visible to potential victims. In this research, we set out to measure the effectiveness of cloaking against the modern anti-phishing ecosystem. We developed the PhishFarm framework to deploy new and previously unseen phishing sites with various cloaking configurations. We reported the sites directly to anti-phishing organizations and monitored blacklist status across top web browsers. The framework is fully automated and highly extensible. Our experiments showed that cloaking is indeed effective at significantly delaying or even preventing the occurrence of blacklisting. Moreover, we found that regardless of cloaking, blacklisting was not functioning as intended and top mobile browsers. As a result, we collaborated with Google and Mozilla, who corrected the issue that we identified in Mobile Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, and thus improved the security of more than 1 billion mobile users.
