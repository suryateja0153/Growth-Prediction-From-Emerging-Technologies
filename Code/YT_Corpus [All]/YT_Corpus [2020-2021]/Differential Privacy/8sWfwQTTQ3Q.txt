 In this video I'll talk about a very important  topic – Privacy. As product managers and problem solvers we are obsessed with helping shoppers  find the right size and fit. But we all have   a responsibility to protect user data and find  that balance between personalisation and privacy.  We are proud to be the only solution in the  market that does not auto opt in your shoppers   into a partner retail network. Many of the legacy  solutions in the market automatically opt in your   shoppers to receive size recommendations across a  network of retailers. Think about that for a second –  a shopper's height, her weight, her age, her  bra size being beamed across the web   to a bunch of retailers without her explicit  consent. We don't think that's cool. Additionally, legislation on privacy is getting stronger and  stronger and rightly so. In Europe the GDPR policy   was launched in May 2018 to further protect all  individuals addressing the collection and transfer   of all personal data. We have already seen large  fines administered to companies like Marriott or   British Airways. Privacy and protecting the shopper  is foundational to everything that we do at Pixibo.   Control and choice are the two important  principles that are central to Pixibo's   data sharing policy. Your shoppers have  to explicitly opt in if they'd like to   share their personal data across our partner  retail network. Data protection is as easy as   that. Reach out to us and we'd love to tell  you more about Pixibo and how we can partner together
