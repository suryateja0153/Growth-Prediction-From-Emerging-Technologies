 cybercrimes are costing the world trillions of dollars annually, and we have been witnessing the impact of them to different sectors. Facebook, Equifax, and Marriot data breaches are just a few examples. Mandiant has offered a lifecycle model, also known as the kill-chain, that let us gain perspective on how the cybercriminals collectively achieve their goals. We present a system, called HOLMES, that looks for common tactics, techniques, and procedures, shortly named as TTP, that attackers often use. HOLMES maps these TTPs to the kill-chain and produces a detection signal in real-time based on the causal connection between them, where this connectedness is a major indication that an attack is unfolding. Attend my presentation at IEEE S&P in May, where we can discuss more.
