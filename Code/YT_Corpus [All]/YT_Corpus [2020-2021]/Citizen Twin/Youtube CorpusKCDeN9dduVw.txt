 a horology channel would seems incomplete without talking about legendary watches especially this brand, The legendary Grand Seiko but wait, aren't called King Seiko? what's the story behind that? so keep watching my video after the acoustic intro Welcome back to Horology Story as usual with me Adrian in a channel I build myself for you all watch lovers, including me so feel free to subscribe if you are a watch lover, watch enthusiast or you just want to learn more about horology so you don't miss the newest update from this channel right here you can see 2 Grand Seiko from 2 very far different generations both these watches are not mine but they are my friend's bro Eka a Seiko and Grand Seiko collector his line up collection is crazy so thanks to Eka for supporting this video and my future videos today I will not focus much on the review but I want to focus more on the story and long history the Grand Seiko what's the different with Seiko and King Seiko what's the story behind it let's go back to 1881 this is the year a man called Kintaro Hattori started importing watches from western countries bacause the traditional Japanese watches are no longer pupular he opened up a business named K. Hattori & Co., in Tokyo and actively imported and repaired clocks and watches 19 years later in 1890 Kintaro Hattori built Seikosha Factory and starting producing clocks the word Seiko means success and the word sha at the end means company so Seikosha means Successful company very cool name in the Russo - Japanese war era Seiko factory was asked to make gun powder for supporting the war and after the war Seikosha Factory started producing watches next era in the year1924 after a huge earthquake in 1923 which took 140,000 lives the Seikosha factory also got destroyed one month after that Kintaro Hattori built a new factory a year later Kintaro established a brand called Seiko over a decade later in 1037 Seiko started diversifying their product a new division was born called Daini Seikosha division the word Daini means the second so it means the secondary division of Seikosha focused on making watches again Japanese loved going to wars in 1937 the Sino Japanese war happened followed by the 2nd world war in 1939 again Seiko was forced to support the war but this particular didn't profit Kintaro because in 1939 every Seiko factory got destroyed except for the one located in Suwa also called the Suwa Seikosha Factory next in 1959 after the war Suwa Seikosha continued to operate and the Daini Seikosha Factory was rebuilt please note that Suwa Seikosha factory and Daini Seikosha factory are 2 different entities here under Seiko name it is intended so so it can compete against each other in making the best watches each have different design style a year later in 1960 the competition between Suwa Daini Seikosha successfully inspired them to make good watch the legendary model was born in this year, the first generation Grand Seiko with the model reference 3180 using the calibre 3180 manual winding movement running at 18,000 vibration per hour 25 jewels made from gold plated stainless steel and with chronometer certificate with acccuracy -3 to +12 second per day with 45 hour power reserve the chronometer certificate was not form Swiss but it was done internally by Seiko Japan and they were not messing around the chronometer certification in Japan shook the watch makers of Swiss because it is very accurate 1 year later in 1961 as a competitor Daini Seikosha responded with the first King Seiko with similar shape and dial detail but the King Seiko logo looked more rigid and firm with capital letters the specification was also Diashock 25 jewels but Daini didn't feel the necessity of the chronometer certification which resulted in public opinion saying that Grand Seiko is the more premium version next development in 1964 this is the year Grand Seiko released its second generation with different design style known as the 57GS line up first started with the model 43999 like this one here movement used is the calibre 430 diashock 35 jewels and this is the predecessor of the next 57GS models the 5722-9990 wih 572A movement 1995 also chronometer certified also the model reference 5722-9991 with 5722B movement without chronometer certification running with higher beat 19,800 vibration per hour in this second generation the Seiko brand again took the pride at the top position the chronemeter writing was also changed to modern san serif, not the classical Italic anymore and this 3 models is what known as the first generation of the development of the grand Seiko responding to this, in the same year Daini Seikosha Factory reselased new generation King Seiko the 44KS model with more modern contemporer shape the Seiko logo took pride on the top of the dial at the number 12 position and the King Seiko was placed at the bottom without chronometer certification diashock 25 jewels movement this model is the King Seiko many collectors are looking for and was put in the same class as the grand Seiko by collectors before the entering the next era I will first review this watch although it is not the first generation of Grand Seiko but this model is already very rare and this still a very valued legend in the world of horology a brand and model filled with history and innovasions let's start from the overall looks and specification the second generation of Grand Seiko from 1964 is the the predecessor of the Grand Seiko know as the 57GS it have very different shape from the first generation the case dominated by edges and the lug is not curved downward some called it Grand Seiko Toshiba the shape is no doubt very calssical with very simple dial for more details I will be talking about it in the next part I will now run the overal specification first the model reference is calibre 430/43999 made by Suwa Seikosha Corporation 36,5 mm diameter 42mm lug to lug length with 19mm lugh width solid stainless steel case and movement used is the calibre 430 running with low beat frequency 18,000 vibration per hour diashock 35 jewels chronometer certified with self dater feature and support 50m water resistant let's have a closer look at the dial and crystal the dial is clean, pearl silver in color with sunburst effect and in my opinion, for a watch made in 1960s this watch have very smooth dial the sunburst effect still looks very cool all of the markers are applied with stick marker style full silver in color with double stick on the number 12 and this has very thick accent of a dress watch next the upper part of the dial there Seiko logo, also applied in this second generation the Seiko logo is placed back at the top with Chronometer writing below it with different front style from the first generation? the font here looks far more modern next the lower part of the dial there is a Grand Seiko logo with very unique twisting font below that written diashock 35 jewels and there is a three pointed star picture which a bit different from the former generation below it on the bottom edge of the dial there are a small writing read 'Made in Japan' with the dial code next to it for more than half a history old watch, every part of the dial is still pretty smooth even the writings is still very clear and firm unique pointed Dauphine hands style added to the elegant accent of this watch the number 3 markers is replaced by a date window with a frame, still looks very neat one of the mainstay feature of this generation is the self dater what is it? more on that later for a 60s watch, the crystal is obviously still using acrylic or plastic domed style looks very good on the dial next the case part the case of this 2nd generation Grand Seiko is unique the main case looks rounded but the lug has a rigid accent to it dominated by lines and edges so overall it loos pretty rectangular so some call it Grand Seiko Toshiba Solid stainless steen case with brushed finishing on the side and polished finishing on the other parts the current condition has many scratches this watch is over 50 years old on the otherside there is a crown without crownguard the other unique thing is the crown surface engraved with W Seiko logo this 43999 model and 5722 both have the same imprint logo with letter W I don't know what this means some said it marks the transition models some said it is the mark after repair or maintenance but my guess is this reflects the part number from fine Knurled crown used and fit for 43999 and 5722 the part number 55W31N5 to maintain the originality move again to the caseback part this part is also a very iconic part for this generation Grand Seiko the special thing is there is a gold coin medallion in the middle of the caseback and this is a separated part some piece loses this part, but my friend's here is still intact and in good condition I will left out the strap part because my friend's watch got it strap replace with custom lizard skin strap pretty exotic one next the movement this Grand Seiko is the very first generation for the 57GS model the movement used is calibre 430 manual winding diashock 35 jewels running low beat with 18,000 vibration per hour and support 50m water resistant one advantage of this watch is the self dater feature what is it? this is a date setting feature which is totally independent so you don't have to rotate the hand to change to change the date for example I pull the crown and try set the date the date setting can be done by rotating the crown up/downwards so if you miss the date intended for this particular watch you can just rotate in the other way to change return the number you don't have to go full circle for the number you just missed different from the usual automatic watch which can only set date in one direction if you missed the number you will have to rotate it for another full round this movement is also already certified by Japan with pretty high standard that's pretty much it for the review I will now continue the story of Grand Seiko because it is still much to tell next are some important timeline for the development of Grand Seiko after the 2nd generation the next important Era was the 1967 this is an important development era for Grand Seiko this year Seiko breakthrough with the line up 44GS in this year Grand Seiko also released their first automatic movement in the line up 62GS next a year later in 1968 Grand Seiko released a 10 beat automatic watch, the line up 61GS and what I mean by 10 beats is Hi beat 10 beat per second or 36,000 vibration per hour Grand Seiko also released 10 beat manual winding in the line up 64GS and first lady Grand Seiko the calibre 9GS 10 beat high precision movement also in this year Seiko challenged Swiss in chronometer and they won the best mechanical watches in Geneva observatory competition next in 1969 Grand Seiko fucused more on accuracy and chronometer which resulted in a very accurate movement with only +/- 2 seconds per day or around 1 minute per year in the line up 61GS and 45 GS with VFA writen on the dial short for very fine adjusted next in 1970 after the accuracy reducing the size of the movement is the next challenge for Grand Seiko So this year the line up 56GS high beat with only 4,5mm thickness got released still very accurate in the same year the 61GS special higher standard of precision was also released in 1972 Grand Seiko released the 19GS highest possible precision for ladies watch with 2 minute per month accuracy after 1972 entering the quartz revolution era or the quartz crisis this was triggered by Grand Seiko ancestor which is the Seiko by releasing the model Astron and Grand Seiko was forced to survive in 1980's everything changed Suwa Seikosha Factory regroup with Daini Seikosha Factory forming 2 division that helped each other Suwa Seikosha becase Seiko Epson Corporation and Daini Sekosha became Seiko Instrument Limited worked together to survie the quartz revolution 1988 - 1997 is the quartz era for Grand Seiko started in 1988 the first Grand Seiko quartz got released, the 95GS line up with 10 second accuracy per year more accurate than normal quartz then in 1989 the Grand Seiko 8NGS quartz with 100m water resistant ability got released next in 1992 the line 3FGS quartz for lady got released wih 10 second per year accuracy in 1993 grand Seiko released the model 9F8 series which made quartz even more accurate with twin pulse quartz next in 1997 Grand Seiko again made an innovation with 9F6 series with mirror finishing on the sides next in 1998 until 2003 Grand Seiko continued making quartz and mechanical watches in many line ups such as the 9S5 series 9S5 GMT and quartz magnetic resistant series in 2003 Grand Seiko never stops innovate back to 1999 the spring drive movement was born but it was't applied officially until 2004 Grand Seiko released the first watch with spring drive movement the calibre 9R65 this is the genius era for Seiko with their spring drive movement started with 9R6 series with accuracy 1 second per day one of them is this one here the Grand Seiko diver with model referenceS what is springdrive? what is it strenght and how good is the SBGA 231? I will talk about it separately let me end the story here stay tuned for the next video about the spring drive tech feel free to subscribe if you are a watch lover so you don't miss the newest update from my channel share my videos to your friend or share them on your social media if you think they are useful I'm Adrian, see you in the continuation of this video, bye
