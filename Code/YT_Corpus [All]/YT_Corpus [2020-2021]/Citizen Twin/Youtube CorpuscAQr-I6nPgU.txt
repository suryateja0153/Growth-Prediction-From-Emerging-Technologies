 welcome to ucl's lunch hour lectures i'm paula le thierry professor of chemical engineering at ucl and director of uclist our new campus that is being built on the queen elizabeth olympic park as you can see behind me so today's lecture is part of a series to give you a taster of the academic activities that you see list will encompass and one of the most exciting spaces that we're planning to have on the new campus is an urban room and so today's lecture will be enlightening to understand what it is and how we can engage within it so the lecture will be delivered by professor mark twitter johnson marquis professor of cities and regions at the bartlett's center for advanced spatial analysis so he's an expert in urban and regional planning future cities public engagement and local democracy digital planning and urban history is also a former uk government advisor on planning and housing issues together as being a visiting professor at berkeley in hong kong shanghai dublin and other prestigious institutions so so in his talk today he will be looking at the history of the concept of urban rooms and explore how urban rooms have been used to involve citizens in engaging with the past the present and future of towns and cities but also how urban rooms can carry lessons for imagining how universities and governments and community groups can come together to critically and creatively forge future propositions for the urban conditions so before i hand over to mark let me remind you that you can post questions on slido the code for this lecture is l h l autumn a u t u m n and we will be answering questions at the end of the talk thank you and over to you mark paula thank you thanks very much indeed uh for the introduction hello everyone and also thank you for the invitation to speak in the ucl east lunch hour lectures as well as paolo explained i'm going to talk a bit about urban rooms and the potential of urban rooms and i have a slideshow that i'm going to run through which is a visual feast it's mainly image-based and hopefully it will explain to you not only what urban rooms are and where they've come from but the potential of urban rooms to perform something that universities are starting to learn about which is outreach and democratic involvement in issues to do with urban change i'm going to run through an example of something that i was involved with before i rejoined ucl this summer in newcastle upon time in the north of the uk where we ran an urban room called newcastle city futures uh some six years ago now i'm going to highlight how we did it what we did but importantly what happened afterwards because it was a temporary exhibition and it realized in lots of different activities and outputs that perhaps we didn't foresee at the time so it's going to learn from stories and the newcastle experience i'll just put the slideshow on that for those who don't know is the river thai in newcastle with newcastle on the right and gateshead on the left and it's an architectural feast of the city and that helps if you're in the city which is undergoing transformational change but also has a range of issues and complexity to deal with then it becomes if you like a canvas upon which you can actually achieve quite a lot and a lot of understanding as well the fundamental question that we're dealing with is how can we understand and shape the long-term future of cities together historically it was something that professionals like architects and engineers and urbanists and planners had responsibility for but as we move forward and as our cities become more pluralistic and become more complex the question is what suitability do our current democratic fora provide for people to talk and get involved with the future of this city and do we need to find new ways of doing it so these are the key issues to consider it's the ways that governments and researchers have traditionally engaged and interacted with citizens and communities through democratic consultation platforms for example but whether they are fit for purpose to continue how do citizens make sense of all the urban change going on around them and could we do things better and how can we be more than tokenistic in the way that we engage people about those changes and critically can the university step into this space being anchored and rooted in distinctive places can they put forward new future methods and approaches which help in understanding what's going on and how we can engage so urban rooms are part of this setup if you think about how the world is changing and how our urban spaces are changing there are critical issues complex problems wicked problems as planners have traditionally called them which are really cause for concern there's issues to do with house prices and affordability issues to do with climate change and extreme weather events issues to do with economic rejuvenation of places the rise and fall of cities issues to do with automation and artificial intelligence concerns about trade which underpins the wealth of cities and places issues to do with making places much more pedestrian friendly walkable cycling we know in the context of covid these are very important issues the importance of green in our cities as spaces of well-being as much as nature and then we have the onset of the digitization and data agenda through smart cities and the way that we interact with each other which are looming and changes behavior of how cities operate and everyone in them as well if you think about how cities change even over short periods of time then it can be quite bewildering all that milestone of change all the questions about what's going on and how are we playing a part of it and how we make sense of that now these two cities you probably recognize on the left is london from greenwich observatory on the right is shanghai and the time period between the top photo and the bottom photo which were taken from the same vantage points is just 25 years in each case so you can see visibly the pace of change that's going on in cities today and that feeling that we need to find new ways perhaps of trying to make sense of this pace of change but equally we find new ways that we need to find to engage about these as well and the key question is what will the future look like i don't mean to look into a crystal ball and imagine and try and predict the future but there are trends and these might be desirable or they might to some of people might be undesirable futures of their places as well we try and make sense of where we are today but we also need to think about where we might be tomorrow as well and that's not just an issue for governments big businesses and experts and elites it's affecting all of us as well the question is how do citizens and communities factor into these issues can they what opportunities are they given to have a say about what happens across the entire city rather than individual developments or parcels of land now these issues we might think are quite new certainly the range of problems that we're experiencing today might be new like the digitization agenda and smart cities agenda but this issue about how to engage people and how people are given the right to express their voices in change go back a long time in fact they go back over 100 years to patrick geddes you can see him on the bottom left there the scottish biologist sociologist and planner who put forward the idea of city museums as far back as 1915 he saw city museums as being the central uh building place in each city that would be a space for the public to address civic thought and action that it would be a chance to take stock of how the city is is forming around people and it would be partly historic uh partly uh foresight thinking about the futures and intentional but it would be a practical way to address these big questions about how the city changes today and he meant it as a concept he trialled these ideas of city museums in lots of places including in newcastle in 1915 but they never really came about what happened as a result of this work is that they morphed into something else they morphed into people making films about the cities in the 1930s and 1940s including in the uk where you had the likes of professor sir patrick abercrombie who was bartlett professor planning in ucl develop plans for the city like london like plymouth developed new models as you can see there in london in the top and plymouth in the middle and then use film as a way of communicating with people the reason why they were using visualization and film and models of cities is there was no such thing as public consultation in planning and development at this time in fact in the uk planning consultation didn't come in until 1969 so for most the 20th century as it developed there was very little opportunity for the public to have a direct say in what happened in a way that we recognized today and these means were used used as a perhaps a more effective way to communicate with audiences the principles of this city museum was that it would be a space between town and gown and it would be interdisciplinary if you think about the way that we lead our lives urban living they don't necessarily conform to the labels of degree programs in the university or the names of academic schools this is about understanding how places are according to people and how they experience them not necessarily academics and professionals but you can use academic studies and academic research to inform that thinking as well so it was about promoting civic consciousness on individual places you could bring in surveys uh historical analysis geographical analysis you could think about different ways you can solve urban problems but it was very much a space to think differently about where that city might be heading and the idea of a museum was it would be a teaching center an exchange of ideas a bureau of municipal information academy of of of civic and practical suggestions uh going forward so quite ambitious but obviously the issue of who would pay for these museums how were they set up and who would own them were relevant questions of the time and in fact they still relevant questions even when we consider urban rooms today now through the 20th century the way that this developed was that individual cities as they progressed their new development plans for these cities uh certainly went for the model idea so that ranged from le corbusier developing his uh tower blocks in the sky in the top left um for the future of paris through to manchester even in the uk through to los angeles and a very large ambitious model with the civic center being put into place there through to tokyo in the bottom right and even newcastle upon time in the top right and in the middle at the top is robert moses who is chief planner for new york uh god-like standing over the model of new york and how that was going to be transformed under his professional advice and professional leadership and these are the ways to communicate but the question is were these intended to get the public and citizens and communities interested or were they a way of selling the city to inward investors to politicians and others in other words parts of the elite rather than parts of a civic consciousness that perhaps gerdes was referring to somewhere in the 20th century it all went wrong because as planning lost its visionary and visual aspect through film and models and the idea of museums so urban planning the tool that we use to bring about and manage urban change was commodified into systems and institutions and governments and unfortunately still the case today when we talk about planning we talk about the planning system and there's a whole commodified way of treating issues and putting them through to planning committees and advising people of how places are going to change on land use terms not on the basis of the city as a whole as an experiential learning environment and so for most of the last 50 years uh questions about urban change if you want to be involved as a citizen or member of the community you're expected to play this game have been involved in the system and to learn the right language of the system to make effective representations and that's no good at all because that is the language of the elite it's the language of professionals and it doesn't necessarily address the way that we can open this up to uh people from all walks of life jane jacobs uh was one person who challenged robert moses of course but also challenged the power of the planners and the language of the planners in excluding people and that was not a democratic way of going forward equally in the uk you had lots of cultural and creative figures like john betraman in the bottom right there who took it upon themselves to make a stance against the professionals about how they were shaping cities and places what was being lost in the process and provide something that was perhaps more akin to the humanities and the arts interpretation of urban change rather than the science of cities as well if we fast track to this century these ideas of city museums have been revisited through sir terry farrell's work on urban rooms farrell was commissioned by the uk government in 2013 to undertake a study on architecture and the built environment and that was published in spring 2014 and interestingly there are overlaps between what gedis was talking about a hundred years earlier and what farrell came up with in his scheme and it lamented about the inadequate methods currently have we have to engage citizens about discourse about urban change and recommended a new type of venue in the city an urban room where past present and future of urban places can be inspected debated and followed through and it was essentially this idea of the urban room that uh is is more akin to get its idea about the integration of several different features a learning environment a community space an exhibition space and maybe still having a physical or perhaps these days a virtual city model to help people understand that complexity of urban change and the question was again who should fund this even if they are a good idea and who should own these things who should have the responsibility of formulated these things sad to say that when the report came out uh the uk government showed little interest in taking it forward but that didn't stop a range of other organizations across the uk and overseas in individual towns and cities taking some of the principles and run in with them place alliance which is based in bartlett school of planning uh it was one activity that was set up on the back of the report they formed an urban rooms network with lots of different places and people around the uk started to experiment with the idea of having an urban room in their own urban space and as you can see just about in the bottom left there this was the diagram from the farrell report farrell suggested that every town and city should have an urban room but it had to be an exhibition space a learning or teaching space a community space dealing with the past present and the future as well and critically it had to be quite visual not resort to the legal and policy syntax of urban change systems which tend to exclude those people who are not used to that sort of language so with all that going on in 2013 2014 in newcastle where i was a professor there we decided to do something very similar this was in advance of the farrell report we were not aware of the power report until it was published but we were involved in a decision a group of us in 2013-2014 to think about maybe we could find a novel way to engage the citizens and communities of newcastle and gateshead in the northeast to talk about the future the long-term future of their city newcastle like most northern cities has experienced uh industrial decline it is a wealth architecturally of of history going back to roman times uh it had hadrian's wall running through it which marked the border between scotland and and the rest of uh britain but nevertheless has experienced mixed fortunes it is now a very successful city a digital city one to grow in digital cities in the uk uh the fastest growing outside london but it has a range of issues that we need to contend with so like most cities it has good fortunes it has bad fortunes and it is changing and if you're a resident of this area maybe you want to participate in discussion about how that place is changing and so we decided that maybe the university could be the anchor institution that steps forward and encourages people to think about shaping their own city going forward outside local government outside the professionals it would just be a window up to everyone to think about what was happening in the city and what a long-term desirable future there might be and that's because in planning today it's very difficult to think about long-term futures that aspect of planning has all but been lost now so it's falls to other agencies to think about this and think about things positively as well the university in newcastle has a history of civic engagement and civic involvement with the city which is located and so therefore it was a natural reaction to think about this in a sort of city museum urban room sort of way there are places around the world that have these on a much more ambitious scale chicago shanghai singapore uh you know chongqing and even london as you can see in the uh bottom right the london architecture center on store street just off tottenham court road but these are quite ambitious but there hasn't been this experience of running these or even resourcing something as ambitious as this in many uk places and so in early 2014 we went about creating our own city museum stroke urban room and we were gifted an elizabethan building which just happened to be empty under the iconic time bridge in the heart of the city as the space in which we could do this we started work in january with the ambition of opening it in may so four months from start to finish the place was entirely empty all those elizabethan building as you can see the inside underwent some terrible 1970s transformation but it was an open space but not much in it and the five of us who worked on this were essentially drawn from the phd community or recent graduates actually five of us only four in that photo emma who's undertaking a phd in curatorial studies david who is a recent graduate architect anne fry he was a project manager for the pro project and then drew suku uh who was the designer of the project and drew will appear in the later picture as well and we just started designing it from scratch to think about what we would put on creating spaces for the public to create their own content not for us as professionals to dictate the content we were aware falling into this trap that if we were just going to say what could be included and couldn't be included in this urban room then we were as bad as the professionals and politicians and multinationals who would decide in people's fortunes and cities for them so we wanted to create a co-creation space and also we wanted to create a forum so it wasn't just a visual model photographic filmic space where people could talk about what was happening in newcastle it was also a mean by which people could debate these things as well and so in that january we created a new label and a new logo the critical issue here was it had to be seen to be neutral which is why we didn't hold it on the university campus we wanted it in and of the city and we didn't want to call it after the university because the university people might assume that it was about new campus development new halls of residence and so we didn't want to fall into that trap so we gave it a brand new name and a brand new logo and that we would commit to opening it for three weeks only as a trial as a pop-up exhibition every day seven days a week for uh six hours and then in the evening we would in that forum space we would have a series of lectures and presentations that our partners would undertake we didn't have much money basically we had forty thousand pounds in total to run this and we had to build the exhibition as well and most of the money went on building the exhibition the five of us gave our time for free and then we set about designing and we created these uh postcards um now these postcards were also turned into posters that were put around the city and we relied on word of mouth to encourage people to come and visit this exhibition based on the key question question what would you do if you were mayor for the day if you were chief planner chief architect what would you do with your own city and these um uh posters and postcards became so iconic is that students started to steal them whenever we put them up around the city they were taken down to put on someone's walls and their halls of residence so they became quite iconic because as you can see here we were showing the city and depicting the city over the very recent past we decided there's no point in looking at roman newcastle and industrial newcastle the existing museums and galleries was full of history about that what was missing from the city about how the recent past had changed what had happened in people's lifetimes so the focus of the urban room was very much say after 1945 and that included come to terms with developments and architecture that people perhaps people detested as much as anything else nevertheless it had happened in their memory and we wanted to tap into that memory as well we also produced a little brochure and the idea of the brochure was it would be full of different events so at the end of the exhibition during the day in the evening we would have an event in that forum space and we produced a program for the entire three and a half weeks but we didn't control the content of those talks we handed those talks over to partners in the city who are already well placed in having networks and associations for them to put on their event all we did was create the space and platform to allow to do it because we wanted to build up trust as a university entity with them to do it we had these partners we didn't ask money from any of them what we asked though was that they could supply image images filmic resources things that we could display even models in some cases so so that we could raid their collections uh on a temporary basis and these were the partners that we that we gave an evening each two that they could decide what they did in each evening and all of them took it to think about not only where they are today but where they might be tomorrow for example as well these were the sorts of photographs we put up and as you can see they're not exactly the picture postcard tourist images of the city um that's what we didn't want we wanted to put up things of urban change that had happened in the last 50 years major public housing programs the modernization agenda major road building programs like the central motorway about how the city had been cleaned in after the war because all the buildings had been blackened by industrial output up until that time so this was tapping into people's memory and consciousness of remembering the motorway being built and remembering house in the states being built and people wanting to talk about those changes that they might have experienced we also included things that were not built but had been planned so the unbuilt and this is not a feature you'd find in most city galleries proposals that were ambitious about change but never came apart like for example on the left the time deck scheme in 1969 an idea to build a concrete platform over the river would you believe in the middle of newcastle and put art galleries and opera houses in the middle of it of course it didn't happen the idea for a monorail linking different parts of the region together running in and out of the football stadium in this case as well of course that didn't happen either but it was about why things don't happen in the way you expect them to which is the principle that we're used to in urban change best laid plans and all that we also then created space to walk around freely here's the exhibition just as it was opening on day one with models and with photo boards and explanation panels behind so people could walk around not be guided not be told where they could and couldn't walk but walk freely and learn hopefully as they went along and there were spaces for them to give comments and talk about what they were seeing as well we included some artifacts so this is one of the more famous uh modernist buildings in newcastle and gateshead uh trinity square car park also known as the get carter car park where it was used as a film location in the michael kane film in 1971 and in the cabinet on the right hand side you can see a lump of concrete and that's all that remains of the get carter car park but if you turned around after looking at that lump of concrete out of the window across the river you would see the site of the get carter car park and it became a nice juxtaposition for people to look at remember the car park which was loved and loathed an equal measure in the city with what was there today what's there today a tesco development and people who are not from a professional background remarking that maybe the car park should still be there compared to what they thought the quality of the current scheme was for this is anne fry he was very embarrassed about this photograph after the press came in and asked her to pose uh like this but i included because what she's holding is a manhole cover would you believe and this was from a major public house in the state in newcastle called the killingworth estate and you can just make out on that photograph that actually there's a town plan on the manhole cover this uh killenworth estate was home to several thousand people with large monolith blocks of housing it's demolished now but when people moved from their terrace housing into these blocks in the 1960s all the blocks looked the same and people were getting lost residents were getting lost all the time so what the council did was put a plan of the housing estate on every manhole cover drain cover right across the estate so we had this in the exhibition and older residents who had gone through that moving experience we came at coming in and saying oh my goodness i remember these in place i remember using them as a kid or trying my find my way back home for example so these artifacts little bits of memory became useful for people to jog people's memory into telling stories about how they cope with urban change the diagram the model on the right is a farrell uh museum feral museum piece you could say now although terry would argue it's a current model because it hasn't been implemented and thus the geordie ramblers and his mentors weigh new walk-in routes for through the city from the university and of course something colorful will really appeal to people even in a physical format kids love this model and trying to work out where they were and so on we had film screenings from the opening of the metro or the life of the former council leader we created space to for students to make their own films that these could be screened in the space as well we had audio recordings of residents who had experience moving from older housing into modern housing in biker that people could play on uh ipods and we included very large scale aerial photographs of change over time and we put these photographs from different periods of time probably 12 feet high on one side of a wall so that people could move from photograph to photograph and see exactly how the place has changed because these days you can do it with visualization techniques very well but it becomes very evident how the city has changed and what's been lost as well as what's been gained the talks we had were really successful and we left it to the partners to devise what they wanted to do but you usually had 70 to 80 people turning up free events every evening in that space lectures presentations panel discussions and so on where people could freely interact with the people who make decisions about the future place we created a children's area because it was important for families and parents kept on saying we never know what to do with our kids so this is a great place to bring them but equally if kids start to get involved with designing their own future city so in turn the parents and grandparents get involved as well and then we had interactive spaces and this is very traditional rather than digital but we asked people about what would you protect in the city and why and this board was about eight feet high as well and people could leave post-it notes and little postcards about what they wanted to see and it covered everything about building the metro to a a you know a peripheral part of the urban area about green in the central area about pedestrianizing i've created new cycle routes so we found that if you create the right means by which you encourage people to have a say about the city they will come forward proactively there was only one or two comments that were negative but we had 120 different ideas emerge in that city city council initially hated the exhibition because they said what right do you have to do it we're the ones that have responsibility you're not producing the plan we produce a plan so you said yeah but you could learn so much from what the public think about these things that you might then build them into your formal planning exhibitions by the end of the third week second third week the venue had become so popular it was being held for business meetings uh unprompted by us that people wanted that backloth of the changing city to make deals about new investments for example school groups started to turn up and prompted to show the kids about recent history of the city as well and by the time we closed the exhibition on the 10th of june by the leader of the council then we'd been open 19 days two and a half thousand people had come in there were 100 different city ideas as i said 24 partnerships had been forged as well so we were exhausted and you can see dhruv is second from left in the bottom photograph there that we were certainly exhausted by the end of this time we had student volunteers incidentally to manage the space on a daily basis and we thought thank god for that it's over it's been incredibly successful but it's over the problem was people's appetite had been wetted so on the back of the expectation there were calls for a permanent urban room and that we would go on and so we had to go on because really the genie had been let out of the bottle as you say that there was an expectation that the university wouldn't step back that we would carry on providing that support engagement and advocacy role so then we had to do it virtually rather than physically so we created a website and we started to find that we were in the middle of a quadruple relationship between local government businesses citizens and universities but here what we were seeing was engagement could turn into policy ideas engagement could turn into new research and teaching for the university and above all people wanted to do stuff not just talk about change but do stuff themselves and to do that back to the urban living issue we needed to harness the talents right across the university not just from architecture and planning but all those people who are doing work about urban change that can be found in so many different schools and centers they all needed a relevant space here so then we started produce alternative brochures about how you can shape the city how you can construct how you can build how you can transform not justly just about we do this already what you what was your view about it but how would you take it forward so we transform from a doing from a look-in and listening entity into a doing entity as well you can't see this in any detail but it was all the good things about newcastle and gateshead a city of innovation that could be taken forward with more ideas about developing the future so we carried on engagement work both online on social media in local newspaper articles in public lectures and we always went to them we didn't invite people into the university because for most people the university is a very daunting place glass steel shiny buildings with lots of brains so we deliberately went out for a way uh to go to other people's places to do these talks and i should say we use social media a lot in order to do that because people use social media to talk about urban change as well we had partnerships with seven stories the national center for children's books for example and using digital and creative methods about encouraging school kids to think about the future according to different age groups we worked with the baltic center for contemporary art in gateshead putting on an exhibition in 2018 using some of our material that we collected into looking at the tyne deck project and then we supported individual organizations across the city to put to put on bespoke uh engagement exercises uh as part of the great exhibition of the north but we also had to do research so at the same time as doing all this engagement work the university was still expecting us to write and to bring in research money and to teach as well so we produce our own reports which was summarized in the state of the city and what might happen and how the university could play a role we produce published papers on many of these which have been produced since the course as well and then finally we worked on projects so on the back of the metro's experience of having an evening in the exhibition where they talked about the 2030 plans for the city we then embarked on a research council-funded project for them to think about how a new design of train might suit the region and we created digital platforms for that occur so 24 000 people got involved in the region in designing the new metro trains and that was factored into the bid for the new trains to the treasury which was ultimately successful as you can see some of the images of how we did it digitally as well we created new technology and new visualization tools for people to communicate and talk and draw about change and this wasn't just for kids it was for all age groups as well that was a separate research project we helped northumbria university the other university to create new um visualizations of the city and how it changed memory scapes project we supported newcastle university in sensor development about thinking about air quality issues and pedestrian footfall for example and then these projects meant that we had to continue the dialogue so these are what we call the mashup events lego mashup events where 40 reps from 40 different organizations came together to design their own projects collaboratively in partnership and build it out of lego so it was a fun experience and we had about six or seven of these entities and something like 75 project ideas came about from just those sessions that we facilitated so all this meant that it was a dream about turning engagement into practical uh help but also serious projects and would you believe in that five or six year period projects have come about real world projects have come about so this idea about what is the housing option for the over 60s in any city going forward this is morphed into the future homes project which is digitally enabled sustainable and energy efficient housing for the life course which has resulted in 66 new houses having planning permission in the city center and it shows you the different partnerships that can be brokered to bring about that change the future of the commercial area from design charrettes into thinking about the space as a green living creative space to attract footfall in the future a 20 million pound new plan for northumberland street in the heart of the city on the back of that initial engagement work in the exhibition and then working with a football club to create a community football facility for deprived youngsters which would also be a digital learning platform 12 million pound scheme also now funded and with planner permission so you can develop things you can turn engagement ideas into actionable devices we created a crowdfunding platform and gave it to both councils in newcastle and gateshead for them to co-fund community-led projects and something like 10 projects have been funded in the last two years for that as well so we grew from 24 organizations in the exhibition to 196 by the end of 2019 and i must admit if you had said that to us at the time the exhibition we'd probably run out of the place screaming because we didn't imagine that we would end up as this successful story but equally one that was fairly exhausting as well we engaged 200 organizations the projects leave it in 33 million pounds worth of projects for the region we created spaces for 155 000 people to engage on the future of their city and 80 project ideas came about now in the finals few slides it has morphed again and rather than being a pop-up exhibition newcastle has plans for a permanent urban room space in that building there which is right in the heart of the city center between the university and the civic center of the city council and that's quite deliberate and that is being co-funded by terry farrell who's alumnus of the university a 12 million pound scheme but that if you like is taking forward the exhibition ideas and farrell's own urban grooms onto another level altogether the difference is these days it has to be partly smart it has to be partly digital because these days the depiction of the city and urban change is already being collated through lots of visualization platforms so what the intention there is to find ways that that physical space can take visualizations and digitizations renderings and make them communicable meaningful to citizens and communities in a bespoke free space you can't see this in any detail but it's going back to the geddes and farrell idea that one urban room can be multiplicity of different things an exhibition space a community space a research and teaching space a learning space and also a partner space to develop new projects as well i'll finish on this which is so small i can have to put all my glasses to read it but essentially urban rooms are an effective way to get citizens and communities to talk about urban change but critically it has to be on their terms not any owned agency or official terms the branding of the urban room is very important as is this position and neutrality if it's too much associated with any one organization you will lose the trust of the people that you want to engage with what you what goes into the urban room has to be meaningful and visible to everyone lowest common denominator visibility here not privilege in those who just happen to have letters after their names it's not about ancient history but you do need to back cast to 50 to 70 years what's in people's memory that perhaps they would like to talk about and use that then to forecast forward 50 years you never talk to audiences or visitors as you would in a lecture but you listen as i'm doing now but the whole issue is you listen people want to talk you listen you allow them the space to think and talk themselves and is not about dissemination and impact on university terms it is about listening back into the university allows spaces for people to co-create the content themselves and we had numerous examples where people could put up their own photographs of a change in city and we collected those through flickr and facebook for example and if you are successful in this it will run on its own course but it might run ahead of you that's the issue so if you haven't got the resources and time allocation in place to really meet the expectations once this is up and running then it will lead to constant disappointment on the people that you're participating with if you lease the disappointment you will lose the reputation going forward it's not about academic or disciplinary debates thank god the world isn't structured and talked about in the way that we do as academics it is about thinking about interdisciplinarity but in a way that the people can find a way to use the right language and have roots out so if people want to do something on the back of what's going on in the urban room have different ways that those things can be taken forward not necessarily by the people involved with the urban room but researchers teachers local government businesses community groups there's a wealth of other agencies already around who could take forward perhaps some of these things it needs to be a usable space and so you need organizations to want to come in and use it whether it's community groups business communities of course teaching but it needs to be beyond the academy not just the academy itself and of course using cutting edge technology and showcasing that technology in a way that gets people motivated especially young people who then might be motivated in skills development and in careers as well it is a distinctive space this opportunity for communities to really address and advance their ideas but it needs to be felt over something that's genuine not tokenistic remember an urban room is not an end it's not a destination it is a means to achieve other things and other projects and other outcomes and in that sense everyone who works in that urban room is an enabler not the expert and at that point of taking up far too much of your time at lunchtime i'll stop thank you very much and thanks paul thank you mark that was truly fascinating so we've got a few questions suppose you don't slide oh i will read them out for you so one question it's about uh um so what you've been telling us on your experience at the university of newcastle so the question is in terms of getting the university of newcastle involved was it the academics the students so phd or undergraduates or the vice chancellors so the university administration who advanced it forward and who was sympathetic to the cause and who was resistant yeah that's very good question um initially it was under the patronage of the vice chancellor himself who encouraged us to get go ahead and go for it i don't think he had any preconceived ideas about what we would do or how ambitious we would be in going back to him and saying we can do this and this and this and this it was just simply create an exhibition uh and and admittedly showcase the university's work at that time and because the mix of experience of those of us who took forward that idea i think the view was that it wouldn't just be an exhibition it would be an exhibition but it would be so much more as well uh we had to uh armed with the vice chancellor then to give us some funding to enable it to happen uh we also went to my head of school uh separately and asked him for some money and played them all off at each other so he said well vice chancellors put forward ten thousand how about you play putting ten thousand in as well then we went to the dean and lost him for another ten thousand so gradually rather than saying here's forty thousand we had multiples of five and ten thousand we kept on going back to them saying if we do this as well you know it could be so much better but it'll cost you another five thousand so by the end of the four months we had forty thousand pounds to play with which was just enough um my colleagues in the school and some of them might be on school on screen um uh i think we're a bit mystified as to why i was taking time out to do this because it wasn't really the day job uh it was something more and i think uh a lot of us the five of us were really exhausted that he had taken over our life by the end of the exhibition more so than our day job but they were very supportive and attended lots of events and they became speakers at some of the events as well um the people who were resistant were not inside the university as i hinted that before the people who were quite resistant were i'm sad to say as a planner but the professional planners in local government who couldn't understand why a non-local government agency would take this on and do it themselves and we kept on saying because the people want to express themselves but there's no way no other way they can do this at the moment i must admit by the end of the exhibition they had turned tortoise they had changed their minds completely as the leader of the council had turned up with his parents and recognized that actually you could see the public appetite for this businesses were very keen as well so by the end of the exhibition when nick forbes the lead of the council closed the exhibition formally um he surprised us all in the last speech by saying and this should be made permanent and we went oh my god no that's that's the last thing we want you know but um i think that the initial resistance wasn't inside the university i think there was concern about the university shouldn't be funding this in perpetuity there was a means an end and maybe other agencies could step in here but of course now with the permanent farrell center on the cards the university is co-funding that and seeing it as a free space going forward as well so there's a resource and budget responsibility which is fallen on the university there thank you mark as you have um uh touched on the responsibility of universities there is a question about the civic role of universities in cities and so can you tell us more about this in particular in the context of london which is so large with 32 different boroughs plus the city of london so each facing different challenges that's a very good question as well newcastle university of the history and this does have a history of being a civic university it is of the place it is of its in the middle of the urban area a bit like universities in london uh mostly and it has a history of if you like giving something back to the place so the relationship between the academics researchers and teaching staff the student community and the city is very very close in fact the university is the largest employer there um as well so the idea about the urban room being part of the civic consciousness of the university was always natural it was it was a close relationship but perhaps other universities have lacked over time in london it's a little bit more difficult mainly because the size of london so you you couldn't necessarily repeat that newcastle experience on a london wide basis just because of the size the complexity of london the different local authority areas as well but you can certainly split up london into distinct areas and abercrombie's plan for london in 1943 talked about london as a comm as centers of communities lots of different communities and you can therefore play on that in thinking about an urban room which addressed some aspects of parts of london with selective agencies could work so something like ucl east which is fixed in the east end fixed on the olympic park including the queen elizabeth park if that started to draw boundaries around it i don't recommend that but if it wanted to look about what its lines of responsibility and extent would be then i would be thinking about concentrating on the areas around the queen elizabeth park at least initially and seen very good partly because you have london architecture center right in the middle of the west end which actually is doing you know many of the activities uh anyway to some extent and there are other agencies as well so you don't want to replicate or duplicate uh some of the good work that's already there so it might be best geographically and politically being not ambitious initially and just seeing who comes into you and then picking up those partnerships and then developing activities on the basis of that but don't start too broadly start modestly and then see you express an interest because those are people you want to you know be be very friendly with thank you mark and one more question it's um you mentioned that you had a place for children in newcastle which was helpful to families did that also enable and encourage genuine so non-tokenistic participation from children about the topics discussed in the urban room yeah we designated the corner of the room as a a play space if you like so we dumped a load of lego there play mats uh things like that even wooden blocks and people could play around with them depending if you know what they wanted to do themselves in some cases it became almost like a crash where the parents left their kids there while they toured the exhibition themselves in other cases we had organized activities usually on sunday sunday after saturday and sunday and we had three different partners who came in for those activities depending on age group so we had a soundscape guy who came in and encouraged people to play different instruments uh representative of the sounds of the city um and that went very well we had um that was for a mid-range group we had um drawing uh activity work um that uh nursery based if you like that uh an artist used to come in and work on we had a archaeologist that used to come in and talk about digging up the city and what they would find and imagine all sorts of things and then we had a slightly older one for digitization and developing digital skills because young people do have digital skills more like us old fogies um so we played around with with those notions as well it some of those morphed into more permanent relationships between my colleagues in the university and elsewhere so one of my colleagues in planning teresa strachan was already working on a undergraduate project with students and schools in the region called yes planning to devise a planning tool to take into schools and that developed much further on the basis of that so so i meant earlier about finding roots out have these things if they successful it works but you want to continue the partnership activities and there's an appetite on the part of people to continue to get involved you don't have to do that yourself i wasn't skilled to do that anyway but you know people in the university around city you could so you want to find these channels of pathways to encourage it to happen elsewhere beyond the physical space because that will be an enduring partnership so many of these things were taken forward and the youth participation developed a life of its own in interacting in the city they set up a youth council for example as well so lots of different ways that perhaps some of the activities exhibition are no longer happening but the legacy of them have morphed into something else thank you so one final question i guess we've got a couple of minutes left so you have described the urban rooms as being very much a physical spaces and for people to come together do you see the role of the urban rooms changing in future in light of the new digital developments happening i i think it's still important covet depending to have physical face to space socially distance face-to-face contact with people that is very important but in some cities it's simply not possible to fund or find you know a suitable place and space to be able to house that and then incorporate everything like large models into that space so going forward there'll be a mixture of the physical interaction but also the virtual communication and dissemination and learning as well and it makes sense you know parts of the university like my own school in casa produce an incredible visualizations of how london is moving or changing then you want to showcase it and it might be better showcasing it on screens or interactive platforms uh or through augmented reality all sorts of things and the content of that is really interesting but the means by which is happening is also interesting so people might be interested in the content they might be interested in how it happens not just what is happening and so therefore becomes an extension of a learning space but also a skills development space for people so i think going forward if this if the city's as much smart as it is social then you need to employ a range of different devices and methods which reflect the era that we're in as well fantastic thank you mark and it's been really inspirational to to listening to you and i'm sorry that we will have to stop uh now um the next uc list lunch hour lecture will be on the 3rd of december when we will be marking the international day people with disabilities with professor kathy holloway who is the director of the global disability innovation hub so to join us then but before that the next ucl lunch hour lecture will be on the 19th of november november so this thursday and it will be about maintaining translational identities during covet 19. so thank you everyone for being with us today and goodbye
