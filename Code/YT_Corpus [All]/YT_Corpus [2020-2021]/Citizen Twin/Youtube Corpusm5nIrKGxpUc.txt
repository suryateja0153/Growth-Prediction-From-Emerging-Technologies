 Blake with SwissWatchExpo here, yet another hot new arrival in my hands, and everybody look out cause this one is a beast. I'm of course, talking about this Tag Heuer Chronograph with a GMT function, as you might be able to see. But what's really grabbing my attention here is this beautiful openwork dial that I think Tag Heuer does so well on these Carreras. Functionally, this watch is great. It's got the chronograph, it's got the GMT hand, second time zone, and of course, what I really love is you can see all these mechanisms at play with the openwork case. As you see me, quick setting the date here by turning this here crown, clockwise and counterclockwise of course, setting the hour hand, you can set the GMT function. This is such an interesting watch, and I could really get mesmerized by watching all of this openwork complication play in front of me. If you're into the horological magic of some of these watches, check out a great example here at SwissWatchExpo.com.
