 I am more stressed about our first born It's stressful she keeps on asking me every morning if the mother will be coming back I tell her she will be coming back because I had informed her the mother is in the hospital but she keeps asking why I can't bring her home If there is anything I would have wished I could do for them is to breastfeed them I don't have a job, there's no money either all they need right now is milk because that's their only food for now My name is Nicholas Ouma I am a family man I have 3 children My wife passed on she was pregnant I took her to Pumwani hospital She was due to give birth she was admitted in a labour ward She was put on a drip, I am not sure whether it was medicine or just water I stayed with her till around 4 pm She had laboured for long and so she had lost consciousness I requested the nurses to allow me leave because there was no one at home to look after our 4 old They asked me to sign some document before leaving since my wife was supposed to be operated on I signed it and they allowed me to leave I arrived home to ensure all is well including making sure our young one eats her food before going to bed at around midnight I received a call from the hospital the doctor informed me that my wife had delivered successfully but she was really exhausted they asked me if I could manage to go to the hospital at that time but I told them it was not possible because I have a young child who could not be left alone they told me it's okay they called me again at 12.30 am and asked if I could rush to the hospital but I told them it wasn't possible not unless early in the morning At 5 am I called his brother who came to look after our child as I headed to the hospital I met a doctor who took me to the theater room He told me the children were fine and asked me if my wife had experienced any complications before during child birth I told him not really because she had a normal delivery with our first born despite her weighing 4.7kg although she delivered in a private hospital that's the time the doctor told me my wife did not make it the news really hit me hard I had to stay strong nevertheless he then asked me if wanted to see the children and I said yes how many children did your wife deliver? twins, both girls the doctor had informed me they were twins even before I could see them they gave me a go ahead to where the children were but I never got to the ward The news that my wife was no more sunk deep and I begun screaming, alerting everyone at the hospital I was taken back to the theatre room I stayed there to around 10 am then I gained some strength I went to see the children I informed one of my friends who called the rest and they all visited me at the hospital we transferred my wife to Chiromo mortuary For the entire time I was at the hospital, I never had the energy to inquire about what transpired before she died I did not even ask but what I know, it's the pressure so after the burial and coming back home with the children... According to our culture after burial of a loved one, you are supposed to stay at home for almost a month as you mourn but I could not stay at home for long because the young ones were still in hospital and with the current corona pandemic they were supposed to be discharged they were not supposed to stay for long in the hospital because they could get infected with something although I wanted them to stay in the hospital for at least 3 months as I make arrangements on how to take care of them when they finally get home but that was not possible, they were only there for a month They were discharged and I came home with them so now life took a new twist... Life completely changed First issue is the corona pandemic, there's no job what kind of job are you doing now? I am a tailor, I make suits for both men and ladies but with the current situation there's no job even my own clients are all complaining of how tough things have become everyone is just working hard to put a meal on the table and not upgrading their wardrobes this is how I have been making a living but if there are no customers...Life has really changed sure I want to dress up Tamara and her sister go play from outside I will call you shortly, okay? will you buy me something? Yes, just go play from outside My daughter knows that once I leave the house in the morning I must bring her something in the evening I used to bring her fries but now with the little I get I must buy milk for the young ones and it's not just the ordinary milk, I buy nun which costs KSh 1,000 per tin They consume at least 2 tins per week in fact at the moment they take at least 3 tins because once they wake up, that is like breast milk to them the milk is expensive and yet business has really gone down If there is anything I would have wished I could do for them is to breastfeed them because, there's no job and there's no money and all they need at the moment is to breastfeed and that milk is all they have I get so stressed when the thought crosses my mind At times my mind is so occupied, I even fail to recognize my friends who say hi to me when I am out there walking who is it calm down Do you change their clothes by yourself? are you solely taking care of them all by yourself? Yes, I take care of them by myself when I am around but when I am leaving, they remain under the care of my in law but most of the time I am with them because at the moment there's not job so I rarely leave the house sometimes friends come through and someone gives me like KSh 200 but that amount cannot do much I am forced to sacrifice and maybe use KSh 50 and save the remaining amount to KSh 1000 to buy milk and the milk is not still not enough  I don't have a job at he moment, generally it's tough everywhere, the situation is bad but should I get any kind of job I can do it because times are tough Since I was caught up in this situation I have not been able to work how old are the children? about 1 month and 1 week so basically they are at 5 weeks? yes would the situation have been better for you in terms of fending for your family if there was no corona outbreak? I would try my best because my life is about hustling but with the corona pandemic, it's tough how are ensuring that your young children are protected against infection? remember they are young and they are more vulnerable true but I keep trying to observe proper hygiene, washing hands like the government advised but basically I have surrendered everything to God  because I am the only one who understands what exactly I am going through Life is hard every morning when I wake up, I dedicate these children to God and ask Him to watch over them I leave the house to go to work but at times I come back empty handed because there's not job sometimes I would just decide to stay at home with them Life is challenging what do you miss most about your wife? our income was little but we would get to share both of us would get to share the little we had she even knew the pin number to my phone we had no secrets between us we were so open to each other Life without her is so unbearable It's really tough sometimes I would wake up in the morning and I just can't stop thinking about her You had told me when your wife regained her consciousness at the hospital she called you yes, she did call me and not just once but severally how was she calling you? Nick, she used to call me Nick she would shake her head this way each time she was calling me one of the nurses asked me to tell her not to shake her head because each time she did that, the pipes in her nose would loosen up So I asked her to keep still because the children who were also under oxygen were being affected and she nodded her head in agreement like she understood what I was saying and immediately she stopped shaking her head so I told my self well....she was now okay I expected everything was okay, and the children were fine as well when the hospital called me I had bought them some clothes which I had planned to take to them at the hospital that morning but on a second thought I decided to leave them behind after I kept receiving calls from the hospital I told myself just maybe she was not okay and probably the children could not be discharged yet on the same day because they were unwell the hospital told me the children were doing fine, but I decided to leave the clothes at home and rush there to find out how they were doing and if they were going to be discharged the same day then I would rush home to pick the new clothes but upon arrival, the situation was different unlike I expected she was fine when I left her initially To date, I have no idea what transpired the night she passed on have you eaten? what did you eat? what did you eat? tea and mandazi I am more stressed about our first born It's stressful because she keeps on asking me every morning if the mother will be coming back I tell her she will be coming back because I had informed her the mother is in the hospital but she keeps asking why I can't bring her home I tell her the mother is still unwell but once she recovers she will come home but sometimes she would tell me that I am lying to her, she was told at the village her mother died So I tell her yes she died but she will come back if she did not have any sins sometimes when we are having our meals, I tell her that if she eats well and becomes healthy the mother will come back with such kind of talk she gets to reduce the many questions she asks about the mother because all she talks about is her mother supposing their mother was alive today, just how different would their lives be? things would be different when we had our first born, it was a little bit challenging because she had to stay at home if she was a live today just maybe I would suffer trying to fend for them alone perhaps for year or two but after she recovers, she would go back to her duties as I continue with my own and together we would assist on another in taking care of these children Yes were struggling even when she was alive but at the moment it's even worse The journey to parenthood has taken a new twist in Nick's life but he says he will not let anything pull him down he is hopeful that in future his children will get to shine someday Reporting for TUKO News my name is Kevin Philips Momanyi.
