my responsibilities and energy at this time need to be focused on my family regretfully i am currently unable to consider a campaign for the senate judd is a big fan of college baseball and the kentucky native was deeply engaged while watching the 2015 southeastern conference championship game between arkansas and kentucky at one point she shared her opinion in a sense-deleted tweet claiming that arkansas was quote playing dirty as the hollywood reporter pointed out that caused an online backlash as ticked off arkansas fans began attacking her viciously on social media it was all nasty enough that it inspired judd to post an essay for mike admitting she'd been the target of ugly social media attacks before she wrote this particular tsunami of gender-based violence and misogyny flooding my twitter feed was overwhelming online harassers use the slightest excuse or no excuse at all to dismember our personhood my tweet was simply the convenient delivery system for rage toward women that lurks perpetually the amount of gender violence that i experience is absolutely extraordinary per the hollywood reporter judd's decision to speak out against her haters unfortunately sparked yet another round of social media vitriol against her at some point in the early 2010s fans noticed that judd looked well different than she had before radaronline contacted a plastic surgeon to the stars who offered his opinion that the movie star may have reportedly received quote a good dose of botox in her forehead along with filler in her cheeks but a rep for judd blasted the speculation telling e news ashley has been battling an ongoing serious sinus infection and flu therefore ashley has been on a heavy dose of medication to overcome it so she could get on a plane and travel to toronto and new york to fulfill her commitment of completing four consecutive days of press to promote her new show missing they were talking about the same woman the same appearance in the same day looking the same way and some said she looks bad she's had work she looks too good she's clearly had work judd herself fired back in a lengthy essay she wrote for the daily beast and the reason she chose to comment on the hearsay about her appearance at all was because of its systemic nature she explained the conversation was pointedly nasty gendered and misogynistic and embodies what all girls and women in our culture to a greater or lesser degree endure every day in ways both outrageous and subtle judd also slammed the media for its role in perpetuating the bias we're going to burn down the patriarchy and build a more equitable and safe and just society for everybody during a 2015 interview with variety judd became one of the first women to speak out against the man who would later be named as movie mogul harvey weinstein at the time she claimed of the unnamed hollywood vet i was sexually harassed by one of our industry's most famous admired slash reviled bosses recounting a situation that occurred with the producer while she was making the 1997 thriller kiss the girls the actress noted that similar incidents had happened to several other women in the industry after accepting an invitation to talk business in his hotel room she claimed he asked will you watch me take a shower and then i got out of there and by the way i've never been offered a movie by that studio ever good job kid you got out of there well done that predator was unmasked two years later in journalist ronan farrow's blockbuster expose for the new yorker in which multiple women detailed their own allegations of being harassed and in some cases assaulted by weinstein judd was not among the women to speak out in pharaoh's article but she subsequently confirmed that it was indeed weinstein she had previously referenced to variety she told the new york times women have been talking about harvey amongst ourselves for a long time and it's simply beyond time to have the conversation publicly she would become one of the first of at least 100 women including dozens of hollywood actresses to publicly accuse weinstein of misconduct by coming forward about weinstein judd also became one of the faces of the metoo movement and during a 2018 panel discussion judd opened up about the systemic harassment she'd experienced throughout her hollywood career per entertainment weekly judd recalled one of her very first auditions it yielded a screen test and i was asked to take my shirt off according to judge she was in competition for the role with another actress but refused the request she added i said that isn't about our acting that's about evaluating a pair of breasts and the answer was not no but hell no in the wake of judd's accusations against weinstein director peter jackson added another alleged wrinkle by offering evidence that judd's refusal to succumb to weinstein's advances came at a high cost to her career he had a reputation let's put it that way he just really had a reputation when casting his blockbuster the lord of the rings trilogy jackson claimed to stuff that he had been warned not to hire judd and fellow actress mira sorvino whose alleged run-in with weinstein was shockingly similar to what judd had experienced jackson said i recall miramax telling us they were a nightmare to work with and we should avoid them at all costs in hindsight i now suspect we were fed false information about both of these talented women and as a direct result their names were removed from our casting list jackson's revelation confirmed judd's belief that weinstein had deliberately attempted to crush her career in retaliation for her refusal to sleep with him armed with this evidence she took weinstein to court make strong female friendships have strong female to female alliances in 2018 judd launched a lawsuit against weinstein alleging defamation and harassment at the heart of the suit was judd's claim that she was in discussions for what could have been a career-making role in the lord of the rings trilogy before weinstein bad-mouthed her to peter jackson judd told abc news i lost career opportunity i lost money i lost status and prestige and power in my career as a direct result of having been harassed and rebuffing the harassment early the following year bbc news reported that a judge dismissed judd's harassment claims on a technicality the law cited in the suit which had recently been altered to include producers and directors was not retroactive and therefore was not relevant to her claims but the judge's ruling did permit judd to proceed with her defamation claim an appeals court then reversed this initial decision in july 2020 according to the associated press ruling that weinstein held power over judd's career thus giving her the green light to pursue her harassment claim by that time weinstein was already several months into serving a 23-year prison sentence after being found guilty of rape and sexual assault while she admits she'll never forgive weinstein after digging deep into her faith in god judd told abc news that she would say to weinstein now i love you and i
