 a new kind of app can deliver 911 safety alerts right to your phone the citizen app launched today in Minneapolis and st. Paul it combines emergency information with user-generated content to keep people updated on what is happening in their neighborhood John Lauritsen shows us the ways it can help and the concern some users have you know it's good to have people aware I think you might feel safer if you know and it's citizens who help provide the knowledge the app focuses on getting real-time 9-1-1 alerts straight to your phone and then if you're near that incident when it pops up on your phone you can livestream what you're seeing the app will send notifications about the type of crime that's happening how close it is to you and possibly a description of the suspect it's also designed to send an update about whether or not an arrest was made and so we make sure that when first responders have responded it's in there that when a suspect is apprehended it's in there Vangelis is an investor and former n-double-a-cp president he says in new york city where the app launched years ago it's also been used to help find missing persons increasingly people who are multi-story apartment buildings finding out that there's a fire next door or down stairs from the app but there is some apprehension I would say that that my concern what that would be is hopefully people don't try to stop the criminal and jump in there and get involved it might give people a false sense of what's going on was crying Sarah laga s'en is a Minnesota native and a professor at Rutgers University who has written papers about citizen she sees it as useful but hopes people take into account additional sources when it comes to crime users John Lauritsen WCCO 4 News Citizen says the app is free and it is funded by venture capitalists the owners say they will never share your personal data
