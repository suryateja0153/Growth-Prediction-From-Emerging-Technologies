 my name is chris norland and i survived a plane crash as a baby i was born at the end of the vietnam war i don't have a birthday so i don't really know exactly when i was born americans know that there were 56 000 gi deaths in the war but what the americans don't talk about is there as many as 3 million vietnamese killed in the war as a result of that there was as many as a million orphans and i was one of them the only paperwork that i had was a little three by five card that said the name of my orphanage so i always knew it was sanctuary orphanage in saigon and there were three names on the card however because i don't speak vietnamese i never really knew what the names meant later in life i was able to contact one of the nuns in my orphanage she told me that 90 of the children died in my orphanage so i'm really lucky to be alive because it was at the end of the war there was enough food water and in fact we didn't even have enough diapers so they put us in buckets for most of the day the one thing that the nurse told me was that every orphan was loved in the orphanage and it's something i always remember that she told me after president nixon resigned the north vietnamese decided to attack and take over the entire country and the americans weren't going to fight anymore essentially the war was over from the americans perspective it was now president ford and he asked the american congress to get money for what's called operation baby lift operation baby lift was a series of airlifts in april 1975. it brought 3 300 vietnamese orphaned children to countries like the usa australia canada and france although the official number says 3 300 children no one knows for sure exactly how many children were evacuated this was evacuation the end of the war so it was very chaotic for whatever reason i was put on the first plane out it was a c5a galaxy which at the time was the largest airplane in the world the really big cargo planes the one you see in the movies the one you can drive a jeep on into because i was a baby they put me in a shoe box and they put that on the airplane passenger seat seat belted us in our plane took off from townsend airport there were over 300 people on the plane about 280 passengers and 30 crew members after a few minutes in the air there was a malfunction on the plane and the rear cargo doors blew and all the people in the lower half of the plane just felt at a death because i was young i was in the upper half of the plane and therefore i survived after we lost power the pilots tried to regain control and so they ended up speeding up the plane and they turned around and crashed into a rice field the plane skidded for about a quarter of a mile and then skipped up back in the air and then crashed into a dike we were full of fuel and the explain exploded into four parts and everything caught on fire the plane was about a mile from the road so when the americans said in the rescue jeeps they had to walk really far across the rice field and the helicopters arrived but they couldn't land and so they would hover above us there was a smoke and fire everywhere they would lower one rescue worker at a time rescue one person and bring him back up in a basket but because the rescue operation was slow some people actually survived the crash but either burned to death or drowned in the mud about 176 people survived the crash and about 138 children and crew members were lost those of us that survived the crash were flown to united states this crash was the largest loss of life in defense intelligence agency history until 9 11. [Music] when i arrived in the usa even though i was here i still didn't have a country south vietnam didn't exist anymore and the americans didn't make me a citizen i didn't have any paperwork so it was actually really difficult to prove that i existed all i had was my little three by five card that said i was from sancta murray orphanage after living seven years in the usa and i actually don't even know how old i am because i don't have a birthday i was eligible though to apply for u.s citizenship so i went down to the courthouse and i swore to be an american like all the other immigrants i had to miss a day of school the next day at school my teacher said what did you do and i said i became an american and i remember really clearly this little girl walks to the front of the room and reads me welcome to america's speech and every kid in my grade made me welcome to america cards and crayon you know statue of liberty and immigrants on boats this is what america is to me after the events of 9 11 i joined the united states navy to be a pilot growing up in the usa people would always tell me that i was lucky to be here and lucky to be alive and in my head the way they make you feel is that america is the best place in the world and all the other countries are not any good so i always felt like i was from a bad place i felt like i was from a place where americans got killed vietnam was never a place that was a good place when i was in the military and i would meet vietnam veterans they were actually my flight surgeons and they would look at my charts and they would see that i was from saigon and they'd always ask me about that and i always felt shame because i didn't know much about my country the thing that they always tell me is that vietnam's a really beautiful country you know for years everyone would always ask me if i would want to go back and things like that and just always seem so far away seemed like another world like many people i was lucky enough to find someone to get married to my wife was a korean national and so i actually flew back to korea to meet the family and while i was in korea we were actually close enough to go to vietnam so my you know then fiance now my wife we went to vietnam for the very first time and i just i fell in love it was beautiful people looked like me which i'd never seen before when i arrived at the saigon airport it was ten sun nut which was the same airport that my plane back in 1975 had left from emotion was was really overwhelming and the humidity i knew i had to return home one of the things about being in vietnam and being in saigon that's different than being usa is everybody knows about the plane crash and everyone knows about people like me one of the things i wanted to do is see if i could find my orphanage and so i did some googling and things because i knew the name of the orphanage and i found the address and as it turns out my orphanage was in the same neighborhood that i chose my apartment it was different than what i had imagined the place just felt like just felt like there was love there and i understand now when the nuns said that they loved every one of us and i felt that when i was there you know people always ask me if i want to find my parents or from my family and it's come to accept that i don't have anyone when i discovered the location of my orphanage there was a little bit of hope that maybe i could find my parents or something and you know i had read stories and and things where you know sometimes these places have like a book where they have all the records and you know we get to the orphanage and we find out the orphans closed and there was no office anymore and there's no book and just kind of accept that you know maybe i'll never know emotionally in 2019 was was a really high for me 2020 though comes and my wife is a korean national and the immigration office was closed last year so i returned to the usa to try to facilitate my wife's green card i haven't seen my wife since december 2019 this year in 2020 i just do everything i can to spread positivity i started a podcast called blue or sky and the idea is that not only is tomorrow going to be a blue sky day something positive it's going to be bluer than you could ever imagine because of where i came from and because of the way i grew up i never looked down on anyone and i never make fun of anyone because i know that a lot of good people in the world can come from any background because i don't have any family i find myself reaching out to people all the time to develop relationships and share as many positive messages as i can because i feel that we can rely on each other and support each other through these tough times [Music] you
