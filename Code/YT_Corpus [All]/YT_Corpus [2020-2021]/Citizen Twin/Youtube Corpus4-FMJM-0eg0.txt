 hey guys Martin here for mattis clarity so if you're looking for the best comfort is around you've come to the right place I've tried a lot of the top brands and I think six comforters really stand out among the rest so I want to talk about each one by one their design and who their get fit for and also some frequently asked questions about comforters which one's right for you let's find out [Music] first off you're looking for a comforter or maybe some bedding or even a mattress go-to mattress Clary calm for some great reviews comparisons and round ups so you might be wondering what is the best comforter just tell me and so that I say calm down you're stressing me out and second there is no one right comforter for everyone that's why I chose six they're a good fit for different types of sleepers from those who like that fluffy kind of cloud like experience those colder nights those who want something on the thinner side for those warmer nights so I'm gonna go through each one by one starting with the Egyptian bedding so I wanted to start with the Egyptian bedding because a lot of times when people think of a comforter thinking of something really fluffy something more cloud like and the Egyptian bedding is definitely that it has 60 ounces of 750 fill power goose down so a very fluffy material very expansive as well and also has a baffle box design that means actually has these cubes within the construction of that fill to fully expanse overall a very fluffy comforter also very warm and insulating good for those colder nights and on the outside a very smooth outer shell 100% Egyptian cotton very smooth to the touch but if you don't like that feel they do have some duvet tabs around the outside of the comforter tie-in to VAE cover for a different feel and then lastly it is a fantastic deal right now for a queen size $119 a very very good value for a goose down comforter like this so if you want something that's a good value something very comfortable and fluffy take a look at the Egyptian bedding next up we have the Brooklyn and all season down comforter now as I said with the Egyptian betting a lot of people who look for a down comforter looking for something fluffy or something more cloud like but that feel is not for everyone and that is why I like the Brooklyn and so much it's definitely thinner than the Egyptian bedding but it's also a very very luxury down comforter it's gonna have some materials like 100% cotton in the shell inside Canadian down clusters with a nice fill power as well so a very luxury down comforter it's also better for those warmer nights it's more breathable so you're not gonna sleep quite so hot underneath the Brooklands then we have the superior down alternative comforter now there are a few reasons you might be considering a down alternative comforter you have for ethical reasons don't want a down comforter you could struggle with allergies or you want to get something more on the budget end and a superior definitely fits all those criteria so it is hypoallergenic so good for people with allergies they don't use any down in the product whatsoever and it's a very good deal $45 for a queen-size it also has a lot of the benefits of a down comforter without the drawbacks so it's still a very fluffy comforter and warm and insulating so if you want a very very good value for a down alternative comforter you also want some of that fluff of a down comforter take a look at the superior moving on we have the chez moi down alternative comforter this is my top value pick right now it's $34 for a queen size on Amazon a very good deal for a down alternative comforter lots of good value it's also has some nice fluff so nice loft and it's also warm and insulating as well now the outside is a little bit rough of the touch a 100% polyester but I think it's a very good duvet insert in fact probably the best value do they insert on this list so I've been throwing around a lot of terms like comforter and duvet and if you won or the difference between the two I did a great video about that exact topic definitely go to our mattress clarity you supe to check it out then we have the Casper humidity fighting duvet but don't worry it's basically a comforter so what sets this comforter apart is its really good for hot sleepers I'm personally a hot sleeper I wake up sweaty and clammy underneath a lot of different comforters but I did not have that experience under the Casper here now the Casper contains duct down and a layer of merino wool now merino wool as a material will find in hiking socks for instance it helps with moisture wicking and heat dissipation so lying underneath the Casper I'm not overheating I'm sleeping quite cool so you hot sleepers out there should definitely take a look at the Casper last up we have the Buffy comforter a very popular comforter right now I added this list because it's an eco-friendly option inside you have the fill is made from 100% recycled plastic really awesome in that respect also in the shell you have eucalyptus really good anti-inflammatory properties very nice for your skin it's also designed with hot sleepers in mind to keep you cool at night so a lot to like what the Buffy and a great eco-friendly option so now I want to answer some frequently asked questions about comforters first off we have what is the best type of comforter now with comforters gonna have two main types down comforters and down alternative now a down comforter is better for those who like that fluffy kind of lofty feel something more breathable a down alternative comforter is better for those who want to save some money and those who struggle with allergies next up we have what is the best down comforter and in my personal opinion if the Egyptian bedding siberian goose down comforter that's because it's really fluffy really lofty really warm and insulating and a very good deal at $119 for a queen size then we have what's the best down alternative comforter and for me it's the superior down alternative comforter and I like this so much because it's very fluffy very lofty similar to what you find with a down comforter but it's also good for people who struggle with allergies and those who don't want to have down in their comforter so last up we have how do I choose a good down comforter and there's three things you want to think about first off think about design is its own through or is it baffle box so through has kind of a tighter design of the fill can't fully expand with a baffle box design you actually have these cubes within the comforter for that bill to fully expand for more fluff also think about it'll wait is it a heavier fill wait how much down you're getting for instance for a queen size something over 60 ounces of down fill is definitely going to be a good choice then the last thing you want to think about down fill power so they'll power is a measure of basically how fluffy is that down so something over 700 or 750 fill power is definitely a good choice in the end if you're looking for a great comforter of one of these six should definitely work for you if you want more
