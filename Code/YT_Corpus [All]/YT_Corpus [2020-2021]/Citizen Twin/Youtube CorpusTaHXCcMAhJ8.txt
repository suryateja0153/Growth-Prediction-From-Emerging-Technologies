 These two gorgeous women look like sisters. They regularly take selfies together, posting photos in bikinis, and fun dance videos.   I can shake it out with   But you may be shocked to learn they're actually mother and daughter. Can you guess who's who? Not so easy, is it? I'm Joleen, the mom. Hi, I'm Meilani, the daughter. Mom Joleen is 43 years old and daughter, Meilani, is 19. That's a 24 year age difference. When I say, "Mom," like in a store, they'll be like, "Mom? "I thought you guys were sisters." And I'm like, "Oh, no, that's my mom." Joleen is an elementary school teacher outside San Francisco and Meilani is a college student. They wear the same size, making clothes easy to share. Wait. Are those my jeans? Yeah. (chuckles) They also hit the gym together multiple times a week to stay in shape. Up. One, two, down. Joleen and Meilani say they don't mind being mistaken for sisters because they really do consider themselves best friends. (impactful music)
