with your GMA first look I'm Marcus Moore ABC News Lihue Hawaii so it's nice to have a little money put aside for emergencies right well a new survey finds that fewer than half of Americans have more emergency savings than credit card debt 12 on your side's Marilyn wort shares some ways to manage your money apparently we like to swipe the average household's plastic debt is more than eight thousand dollars so here's a question which is greater your emergency fund or your credit card debt that's a tough one probably the emergency savings my credit card debt according to a bank rate.com survey 28% of Americans have more credit card debt than emergency savings and another 16% have no credit card debt but no emergency fund either it's a balancing act on the one hand you have your credit card debt that you're trying to pay off on the other your savings that you're trying to build what you need is a plan I would say work on bow at the same time financial adviser Kent Copeland says an emergency fund is essential generally I'd say start trying to get one month's salary use direct deposit to have part of your paycheck go to savings and those credit cards Copeland's suggest paying the minimum on all but one and knock that one out which one some would say the highest interest rate I say the one with the lowest balance I think you need a pat on the back I think you need to get a card paid off and see that it's working but the key is discipline my suggestion is is find an amount that you can pay down the debt and you can put into your savings and stay with it Marilyn

mid 60's couple of upper 50s in the Hill Country there is a ton of humidity out there dew points are above 60 in many locations that's that threshold where you really start to feel the humidity and you do notice and when you step outside but we do have a front moving through later on this morning so it what's unusual is it's actually going to warm us up in behind this front for a couple of reasons first of all we get this dry air moving on in here so by actually late in the morning early afternoon that front comes through dew points drop down the wind is going to be out of the Northwest to almost west and it's actually going to be sort of down sloping so when that happens it compresses it heats up that's gonna put us up into the mid-70s later on today tomorrow morning we start off very nice morning very pleasant nice in the afternoon about normal a little bit above that then the secondary front is going to move through late in the day and that's really gonna pull in the much much drier much cooler air and that's gonna be for Wednesday morning so it's going to be cold Wednesday morning then only about mid 50s in the afternoon and this is what temperatures are gonna be doing again we get up into the about mid 70s later on today and then tomorrow we this one has us up into the low 70s maybe about 70 years so then again that cooler air moves on in here and that's for a Wednesday and that's only 4:30 the morning by about 7:00 in the morning our coldest time of the day we're gonna be down around the upper 30s here in town by Wednesday morning Thursday is also gonna be very very cold we're gonna be close to freezing here in town then we'll warm back up by the weekend by the way plenty of sunshine and after these few little showers get out of here this morning that's it as far as any brain building in the forecast 69 today at noon partly cloudy skies and then high temperature today up to 75 wind out of the Northwest and much much drier air moving on in here so the humidity is going to be dropping down by later on today now tomorrow pleasant start about 47 70 in the afternoon the next cold front moves in there late in the afternoon tomorrow that pulls down the colder air 37 Wednesday morning 32 Thursday morning lots of sunshine a couple of good-looking days Wednesday Thursday Friday as well we warm back up into the upper 60s and then some about 70

like there may be just one little left over right there crossing to 81 heading in toward a Canyon Lake couple little stragglers in behind that so if there is a sprinkle here in town don't be too surprised by it but again all of this is continuing to work its way out of here so we'll have one or two of those leftover sprinkles around here and then the front moves through and like I said drives us out because yeah you've got these numbers temperatures are up in the 60s right now and you've got all this humidity which that combined with the cloud cover doesn't allow us to cool down but dry air also heats up very quickly so once this front moves on through here temperatures are going to be really shooting up later on today there is just laundry list of allergens out there everything is starting to blossom obviously so we have a couple of showers left over mainly to the north and warm start this morning and then a cool front comes through but that's gonna warm us up because the drier air moves on in here we're gonna have down sloping winds coming in here primarily out of the northwest to west mostly sunny skies today good-looking day and then tomorrow still a lot of sunshine not

behind me according to police they got the call around 4:30 this morning they say that the woman and her three children were in this SUV when four men all with guns came up and forced them out of the car you see the SUV is still here the reason it's an attempted carjacking according to police is that the gunman could not get this car started they took off in their own white SUV and that is what police are looking for that vehicle with those four gunmen inside again they were not hurt physically according to police but it has to be a very scary experience based on what we were told again that

medications do you like most patients wanted to find relief that didn't involve powerful painkillers the Mayo Clinic finding 94 percent of post surgery patients surveyed said they'd prefer an alternative treatment over taking opioids the top concern addiction with drug overdoses claiming more than 70,000 lives in the u.s. in 2017 if there's anything good about this epidemic it has brought attention to the fact that we need other alternatives for pain management and there's now an ever-growing list of alternative treatments from diet to acupuncture even yoga and meditation as well as procedures like the one full MERS undergoing called a medial branch block medication is going at her doctor at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York says the injections have been used for other ailments including lower back pain but are now revolutionising the treatment of chronic headaches with results that can last for several weeks and actually each way without feeling any sort of finishing but despite the availability of alternative treatments and an interest expressed by patients the Mayo Clinic finding that only a quarter of post-surgery patient surveyed actually talked to their doctors

within the normal travel time range now a little while ago Michael Said's asked me to kind of keep an eye on those these cameras up on that far northwest side so here we go this is high 1006 no 4 and here's the difference from earlier this morning now we're starting to see a little bit of Sheen to that roadway up there so the roadways are damp so that interchange cloverleaf interchange up there I 10-6 know for you we'll have to slow down through that area does appear to be a little damp out there on that overpass so no doubt if the overpasses damp that means those clover leaves those long curbs also gonna be just a little slick this morning yeah I guess maybe I wasn't paying attention I know about an hour ago Mike mention we might have some sprinkles in the area but that's the first time I've seen earlier this morning everything was fine it looked a lot different was the main kind of area of rain that's moved on through just these little spots that have kind of popped up on the tail end of it snow one of them moving through the the northwest side of town and one up there by a canyon lake right now so that'll be about it and then we have a front moving through mid-morning and much drier air will warm up could be a beautiful afternoon today look at this you know we're talking about the laundry list of allergens out there and it's all due to these little guys pollinating all the flowers it's a beautiful picture I love that flower Thank You Mary very much for the ok sec connected picture thanks for all the work you do there little mr. bee pollinating we've got lots of clouds this morning that has helped to hold some of the heat in along with the very high humidity and here's what we're talking about them obviously the majority of the rain is off there to the east but then we've got just these few little straggling little spots here and there and so here's one that moved in it's kind of coming down 10 so that almost looks like it's moving down in toward 10 410 area right now and then those few up there to the north moving across 35 in toward you braunfels Canyon Lake so watch out for us some of those that's not very big but that's got a couple of buddies and downpours associated with so that's the end of any of the rain out there 61 hello 265 in town and 63 up the road in Canyon Lake these numbers are about what the normal high is right now and there's a lot of humidity out there but again that's gonna be changing by mid morning so here's what goes on as far as that it's more of a I guess you'd call it a dry line instead of a front because temperatures are gonna be going up and behind it because dew points will really dry out about half of what they are right now by late in the morning and noon and that's gonna set us up for a beautiful afternoon plus we get some of those down sloping winds coming in here out of the west and northwest then tomorrow we start off nice and pleasant and coolest morning low humidity very maybe a jacket tomorrow morning and in the afternoon make it up to about 70 then the next cold front moves on in here this is really gonna be pulling down this very very dry air when you see these dew points down in the teens that's when it's we're talking a little taste of arctic air and so that's going to hold temperatures only in about the mid 50's by Wednesday so today we make it up into the mid and even some up 70s tomorrow morning and a very pleasant start then we make it up into the low 70s by the afternoon tomorrow and then that front moves on through here and here comes that colder air moving in for Wednesday morning will actually eventually get down into the upper 30s by Wednesday morning and the low 30s looking another freeze here in town by Thursday morning clouds right now those few little leftover showers and then all that continues to move on out more sunshine this afternoon and then nothing but sunshine in behind that for the middle latter portion of the week maybe a couple of clouds

lanes of i-10 and again it's not much not only amounts but also coverage but it happens to be in one of the worst spots going right down ten and or ten so there you go but this is gonna be changing we're not gonna have a wet roads for a few days now no we're not gonna see after this morning we're not gonna see anything as far as any rain until maybe sometime next week car wash just bang you will get your money's worth if it doesn't get rained on this morning here in the parking lot oh look out there they're blooming going on right now even some of the cactus are blooming great picture thank you very much for that lots clouds around this morning and here's the rain again majority of it is well off to the east but then we've got these few little straggling little spots kind of hanging around and there is some ground clutter in there and a lot of this has sort of fizzled on out here was this this one little spot that moved through right there almost along 10:00 and in toward 4/10 and now it appears as though that has pretty much like I said kind of rain itself out there maybe a couple of little leftover sprinkles here and there mid 60's right now about the normal high temperature a lot of humidity dew points are well up into the low and even some mid 60's you get above 60 and that's when you start to feel it now we've got the front moving through cool front dry line whatever you want to call it by about late morning so dew points are really going to be dropping down say about 10:30 11 o'clock as that moves on through here obviously sooner in parts of the hill country we get this drier air moving on in here that will allow temperatures to warm up so we're gonna make it up to 75 degrees later on today low humidity great looking day plenty of sunshine this afternoon good-looking start tomorrow and then and we get another front to move through here late in the day tomorrow and that's really gonna pull down much much drier air and much much colder air so we're gonna be down into the 30s starting off by Wednesday today again we get up into the mid-70s and then down around I'll say the upper 40s tomorrow morning up to the low 70s by the afternoon and then there comes the colder air coming on in here so definitely a freeze in the hill country Wednesday morning as well as Thursday and close to it here in town as far as freezing here's the computer model and again it's got some of the leftover showers hanging around here that moves on out with the front that moves through this morning a few leftover clouds and then nothing but really sunshine and clear skies then going in through tomorrow through Wednesday Thursday and one or two clouds around here on Friday here's the satellite and radar loop over the past couple of hours again all that rain moving off to the east of us and there's those few little straggling specks in behind it and this low right here is the one which is going to pull down the first front initially and then the secondary front which comes through tomorrow and like I said that's gonna pull down some much colder air no rain in other than the few showers around this morning nothing if for at least about the next week 69 degrees today at noon partly cloudy skies and then high temperature today up to 75 northwesterly wind about 10 to 15 miles per hour much much drier air is going to be pulled on in here and that's going to then allow temperatures to get down closer to normal by tomorrow morning and then we'll make it up into the low 70s by tomorrow afternoon the next front comes through here 37 Wednesday morning up to 55 down close to freezing here in town by Thursday morning Friday another good-looking day a couple of extra clouds around still a chilly starts even on Saturday morning we get up to about 70 over the weekend with a few more clouds by Sunday alright sounds nice thank you Mike right now we're at six six nineteen sixty-five degrees new surveillance video shows what's believed

planning a protest later this morning outside with live cam mid-60s here in town we're waiting to see what that sunrise is going to look like but I think up to see a few stars so you're looking pretty good good morning to you it is Monday it is February 24th thanks for being with us this morning so we had a few showers in the area this morning but they're moving out yes there could be a couple of damp spots on the roads and then we've got a great stretch of weather coming on in here and make sure you haven't put your coat away because it'll get cold Marcus is here with the steep peak and how things are looking here at the bottom of the hour now we've been talking about the slick streets up there on the northwest side however that's not where the accident popped up for that we're going to go to the southwest side we're looking at the eastbound main lanes of 410 just past 35 right there at Somerset Road minor accident currently in the clearing stages so keep that in mind if you normally head through that area right now as we take a look outside through trends got various cameras some areas kind of dark like 37 to 10 but then thirty five or six no four you can see starting to pick up in the volume in traffic both on the north and the south bound lanes no problems there 410 at Austin Highway but up on the northwest side particularly that area right there Frederick's our days avala between I ten six no four just very very damp and slick out there so just remember it reduce that speed and increase that following distance Mike any chance of any of this drying up sooner will it remain with us the rest of the commute well I think as far as the cloud covered the humidity is not gonna let things dry up too awfully much some of the obviously the traffic on the road is gonna help to drive things out because it wasn't a lot just couple of sprinkles out there we do have obviously have lots of clouds not much showing up on radar as of right now I mean a lot of this is just ground clutter in and around the radar site including here in town but you can see how some of these showers just sort of worked their way on through tenem moving through fairly quickly just enough to make the roads damp there so yeah a couple of damp spots here and there now as far as drying we are really going to start to dry out about mid-morning because that's when the cool front is going to be moving on through here so we'll go from temperatures in the mid 60's right now and 50s in the hill country with all of this humidity out there dew points well up into the low to mid 60's then that's going to go away and we've got a fantastic day in store laundry list of allergens boy oh boy it's everything in blossom right now 69 at noon 75 for a high temperature despite the fact that is a cool front we are going to be warming up to 75 degrees northwesterly wind 10 to 15 miles per hour good-looking day good-looking day tomorrow then a cold front moves through here and that's ruling in to knock temperatures down close to freezing again we'll get it all sorted out in just a couple of minutes mark thank you Mike now to breaking news a San Antonio police officer is now behind bars after

just to face a chronic conflicts with peers could have a lasting impact on a teens health as our maryland north reports new research suggests the body remembers years later most of us can relate to the ups and downs of being a teen remember it constantly it can be hormones friends or fear of the future but is teen angst here today and forgotten tomorrow we'd like to think we're beyond it and we're not as far beyond it as as we'd like to be and it matters more in sticks with us longer social scientist Joseph Allen and his colleagues recruited 180 for 13 year olds and followed them for 15 years they interviewed the teens their parents and friends to find how they resolved conflict at age 21 the participants were rated to see how they responded to hostility from a romantic partner finally participants had a blood test at age 28 researchers say adult participants who reported a lot of stress and conflict during their teens had Merkers of a higher level of immune system inflammation it's called interleukin 6 and it has been linked to everything from tumor formation to arthritis to early mortality the findings suggest the body does remember teen conflict and that can hurt your health years later conflict is not something that's trivial first say you should model conflict resolution for your teens and talk openly about why you disagree with your partner Marilyn Morris cake set 12 news check this out everybody after historic night in sports on Saturday an emergency goalie will be honored and Raleigh North Carolina here's back story Saturday 42 year old Zamboni driver David Ayers was designated as the emergency goal in the game between the Maple Leafs and the Hurricanes although emergency goalie designations are common they're rarely needed but after both goalies for Carolina went down with injuries the team told Aires to put on his pads and get in the goal to finish the game hey the Hurricanes won the game and Aires became the first emergency goalie to ever get a win in the NHL so now the Hurricanes organization is flying to the Toronto native down to Raleigh to honor him before their next game and the city's mayor is dedicating tomorrow as David airs day organization also selling shirts with his name and number Aires will get some of the royalties and part of the proceeds will go to a kidney foundation in honor of Aires who underwent a transplant back in 2004 but can you smell a movie now out of all of this Zamboni driver was dizzy the emergency fell out no it's awesomeness it's a fantastic story it's great had a kidney transplant Wow alright let's find out how the roadways are shaping up what's like what's happening out there Marcus do you imagine if he got hurt and what's next yeah now who are you gonna get right because it's the PAP the popcorn guy I guess right now I take a look at the roadways as we do have this accent still the clearance ages down the southwest side we're looking at the eastbound main lanes of 410 right there at Somerset you can see right after Somerset speeds do pick back up but watch that speed once you do head out this morning conditions are slick I tense at 4:10 there we still have some slick roads out there it looks like it might be starting to dry out just a little bit we're not quite seeing the spray being kicked up that we saw earlier this morning I 10-6 know four still have that Sheen to the roadway there at the cloverleaf interchange so just make sure make sure you have both hands on the wheel put away those distractions no cell phones those coffee cups of course buckle up and watch that phone distance once you head out I'm sure somebody has already thought that would be a great movie and is getting the wheels in motion I never knew that was a situation in hockey that you designate the emergency backup goalie hockey so I guess it makes sense right yes you can get pretty hurt okay yeah but I mean another night warts you know they two quarterbacks get hurt you might bring in the wide receiver who played quarterback in junior high it's great that makes sense yeah ah interesting and it would be a great movie maybe cool I wonder who had to drive the Zamboni between the second third period though I don't know eventually you're the guys up the gun but light here no go no you you come suit up we need you in the going now to take a look at this picture why is this a peaceful looking into cows in a pasture like this the Sun too behind it and the clouds great picture thank you very much for the a case that connected picture make sure you keep sending them on in there obviously we got lots of clouds around but there is a little bit of a kind of a broken line there above those clouds as far as the cloud cover is concerned rain well off to the east of us and we have a few little sprinkly showers that slid through earlier and like Marcus is pointing out it looks like a lot of the the traffic has maybe dried some of the roads out because this was not a huge ordeal with those showers coming through just those few little specks and and that was pretty much it so that's gone and we're not gonna see anything as far as any rain for at least about a week 65 in town 64 Bal Verdes 50s in the hill country and we've got a lot of humidity the temperature right now is about and what the normal high is that will all be changing though especially the humidity by later on this morning so we get this first cool front to move through here and by mid to late morning and by noon the drier air is going to start to work its way in here beautiful day then mid-70s we get some down sloping winds off the plateau in the western portion of the state and so that's going to help to warm things up and then tomorrow we get a secondary push the cold front actually cold front is going to come through here and so we'll go from about 70 or low 70s and then the bottom drops out as we get that colder area and drier air to come on in here with these dew points down in the teens that's really going to allow temperatures to drop down so we'll be down in about the 30s by Wednesday morning and then close to freezing by Thursday morning so today we make it up into the 70s and then tomorrow morning we'll drop down to about the I'll say like as a upper 40s in the afternoon low 70s then the colder air comes on in here and it'll be down in the upper 30s again by Wednesday morning and even colder still by Thursday we have the clouds around this morning and then that's it as far as any cloud cover we're gonna see nothing but really sunshine a few leftover clouds today and one or two of them may be thrown in here and there but really nothing but sunshine through about Friday today 69 degrees at noon a few of those leftover clouds and then mostly sunny skies today 75 for high temperature with northwesterly wind at 10 to 15 miles per hour tomorrow another good-looking day about a normal start and we get up to 70 plenty of sunshine the cold front then moves through here down to 37 Wednesday morning 32 got a good shot at freezing Thursday morning temperatures only in the 50s those two days but boy beautiful sunshine and then a couple more clouds Friday after a

slick streets although the highways look pretty good there I attended a Zavala look at that mirror reflection down below on the access road so those turn to those curves definitely gonna be slick this morning Mike yeah we had those few little kind of straggling showers that moved on through here there's a nice line of some the glow of the sunrise but plenty of clouds still hanging around here we're gonna keep plenty of clouds around nothing is showing up on radar as of right now and temperatures are in the mid 60s so about the normal high right now however that's going to be changing and there's a ton of humidity out there as well with those dew points so high but by about say 10 11 o'clock this morning all that's gonna change wind shift around to the northwest we get up to 75 later on today and in tomorrow about 70 another cold front moves on through here and this one's packing the punch and so we're gonna be down close to freezing by Thursday thank you and thank you so much for spending
