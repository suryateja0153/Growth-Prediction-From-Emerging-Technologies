 I sat for my KCPE while I was pregnant but no one knew about it He would buy me chicken, chips, give me money for salon He provided everything I asked for My mother used to cry because she felt I was an embarrassment and I was pregnant for a criminal I would pick items even from my friends house then sell to buy food and diapers for my child My name is Margaret Njeri, I was a pupil at St. Martins Primary School I dropped out in class 6 Why did you drop out? I felt like no one loved me, I was like a trouble maker and I seemed to more aggressive than my friends I also felt like the odd one out because some of my friends came from well off families like they had the money Sometimes we would go without breakfast and you know you cannot concentrate in class on an empty stomach How did you meet your boyfriend? I met him after I had dropped out of school I used to go hang out with some guys who were my friends in Kawangware I asked them about this particular guy who would comment on my status and photos on social media they told me he lived nearby and that he was into art mostly printing on t shirts I was elated and wanted him to print one for me I reached out to him on Facebook and told him that I wanted him to print my name on a t shirt I was supposed to take the t shirt to him but he kept taking me in cycles he said he was not available during the day but could only be found at night he told me to take a bodaboda to his house and that he would pay for transport I arrived where he lived on that day but I had forgotten the t shirt, so he showed me around and said that is where I will deliver it I ended up spending the night at his place then the next day I went back home We were in constant communication from that day until I ended up dating him We dated for close to one year when I got pregnant and delivered in April 2019 My name is Minayo, I am a mother to one child that I gave birth to at the age of 13 I met he father to my child while I was attending school where exactly? Just along the road while I was heading to school in the morning he asked me if I was heading to school and I said yes love blossomed right there I never liked visiting his place but lack of school fees pushed me into it the back and forth that I witnessed because my mother could not go to school since she did not have money made me give up on education I was being sent out of school every other time and yet my younger siblings needed education as well whenever I was sent out of school I would spend the entire day in my baby daddy's house in the evening when I go back home mom would ask about home work and I would lie I finished it while at school She would cross check my books and realize that indeed I had done my home work but truth is I left some books in school I met my boyfriend while in class 8 although I begun dating him while in form 1 during half term holidays he used to buy me chips, chicken and give me money to make my hair he provided everything for me and even gave me money, close to KSh 2,000-3000 I had no idea where he got the money and I never bothered to find out the guy gave me everything I needed, money was never an issue to him my mom would ask me where I got the monies I had and I would lie that I had picked it along the road she had no idea what I was doing and even if anyone would tell her her anything she wouldn't have believed them your mom never got suspicious whenever you told her you had picked money along the road? she did ask why I was the only one that lucky to pick money I would collect money from my boyfriend and keep it somewhere in the house where mom would see it she would then try to inquire about the money but I would not disclose that it was mine she would eventually give up and send us to buy food with the same money I thought by falling pregnant for that guy it will strengthen our relationship which one do you prefer among these two boyfriends? tell them you will date both of them no..you shouldn't be like your mom just tell them you will date both of them everything was okay at first but he started dating other girls when I got pregnant he said that I was trying to joke around with his mind and that the baby was not his he never visited me at the hospital when I went to deliver and never even picked any of my calls 3 weeks later he started looking for me because I also went silent on him one of my friends asked me if I knew what kind of job my boyfriend was doing but I said I had no idea she told me that he was engaging in robbery I wasn't shocked that much because already I was in love with him We continued dating when I got pregnant for him during our August holidays while still in Form 1 I was 15 years at that time and I was living with my mother here in the ghetto I felt really bad that I was pregnant for a robber I thought of abortion but I decided to carry the pregnancy I neither told my mom nor him about it, he got to find out through friends he said he wasn't ready to become a dad and I told him I wasn't ready to become a mom either I asked him for money to terminate the pregnancy but he said should I do that he would beat me up I decided to carry it and I ended up spending at his place that night my mother came looking for me and I ended up disclosing that I was pregnant she felt bad and even cried but there's nothing she could do because terminating it was not an option I knew my mother cried bitterly because I had embarrassed her by getting pregnant for a robber he has never stopped the habit though, it worries me a lot because I know he might end up being arrested or gunned down It's hard for me to convince him to stop because he turns violent sometimes, he is a rebellious person I never disclosed to anyone that I was pregnant, my boyfriend was scared and never wanted my mother to find out I kept silent for 3 months and never told my mother because she is a hot tempered woman were you still attending school? I got pregnant while in class 8, I sat for my KCPE while pregnant but no one knew I scored 179 marks, I performed poorly when I discovered I was pregnant and also I would skip going to school I started experiencing mood swings at 3 months, I would throw up at any given time even the smell of perfume would irritate me the first person who became suspicious was my grandmother but when she asked I denied and said I was fine she told my mother that I was pregnant my mother confronted me and when I confessed that indeed I was pregnant she sent me to the village when I came back she said she wanted to know the man who was responsible I called my boyfriend and told him to come along with his mother because should he come alone my mother might hurt him the mother asked to go live with me then bring the baby home to my mother after I had delivered I lived with my boyfriends parents until when I gave birth later on he changed, he started dating other girls but whenever I would ask him about it he turned hostile I have been so patient with him for the entire 2019 but I have seen a lot but come 2020 he suddenly turned violent and whenever I asked him why the sudden change he said I was scrutinizing him I told him that I was exercising patience because the baby was still young I left his house and came back to live with my mother I had never told my mother that this man was violent but upon coming back home I opened up to her she went to his house to talk to him with the village elders but the man was so harsh to them he said he had already buried our child and I told him it was okay I was taking care of the baby I came home with my baby we took the matter to the chief but the chief was bribed he ended up defending the man does he support the child in any way? not that much and unless I remind him he doesn't bother he would claim that he's even forgotten, but I would often remind him that I need food and diapers for the baby It's challenging bringing up this child because at times I would lack all the basic needs and it feels like the world has come to an end The baby is there crying and here I was having not taken breakfast, lunch and not even sure of supper Sometimes I feel dizzy because of hunger and you know a male child breast feeds a lot does your boyfriend support you? not really because he doesn't have a stable income his kind of job is flooded and because of that he doesn't earn good money he only sends money when I reach out to him but if I don't remind him he doesn't bother either when I reach out to him especially when the baby is unwell he promises that he would send some money the following day but when that day comes he goes missing, doesn't receive calls or respond to my texts my mother would say she can't settle my child's hospital bills so I would look for jobs in peoples houses, wash utensils and do general cleaning then I would use the money I have earned to buy pain killers for the baby there's a guy who gave me a job at his place where I would clean his clothes the man started making advances at me, he wanted to sleep with me but I refused because he is old enough to be my father I threatened that I was going to report him to my mother and you know both of them are friends he did not want to ruin that friendship but he said that he will still sleep with me anyway what are other challenges are you facing? some people fail to pay on time when you clean for them then they will end up avoiding you the disappointment of asking for your payment makes you give up on them how do you manage to get food for your child when you work for someone then you are not paid? I ask for help from some friends although I don't do that all the time because again you could ask for money and someone genuinely doesn't have any some people will tell you off and ask you to go get money from your baby daddy others even backbite you and call you a beggar saying that they were not responsible for your pregnancy have you been forced to engage in any other activities to ensure you get food for the baby? I have engaged in stealing, I would pick items from my friends house just to sell and get money to but food and diapers for my child I once stole a phone from my friends house, I sold it and used the money to buy clothes, diapers did general shopping for my baby what else? I once attempted to steal a gas cooker from another guy's house but I was scared I might get arrested I thought of how my child would survive should I end up in jail I had hidden the cooker in the toilet and I was just about to leave when he suddenly came back although he never noticed I decided to disappear with his phone and leave the cooker behind I knew his phone password and his mpesa pin I just wanted to sell the phone and the cooker so that I could get money to buy a baby carrier for my child but my plan failed did you manage to get the baby carrier eventually? no how has been your relationship with mom? it's been strenuous, because she once told me that should I get pregnant I should never step in her house she would chip in sometimes but when I annoy her she ends up collecting all the stuffs she had bought for me she would say that if at all I decide to leave her house then I should not go with the items she had bought for me what about your father? he has never visited us since he separated with my mother there's a time I left my child sleeping and went to collect a shawl at my friends house the child woke up and started crying before I could come back when I reached the house I had to explain to mom where I was coming from because she thought I had gone for a walk she ended up hitting me badly and even insulted me saying that she did not ask me to get pregnant she told me to leave her house, so I took my child and went to live with a friend of mine called Anne I was away for one week I ended up smoking weed and chewing khat but I stopped because I felt it was wrong to indulge in drugs I decided to concentrate on raising my child do you feel like you disappointed your mom? Yes, at times when my younger siblings make a mistake and I try to discipline them I am told never to touch them but instead punish my own child I just decide to keep to myself because I am reminded that I made a mistake already by getting pregnant it's difficult getting along with your mother once you give birth because she feels the burden of looking after your siblings, yourself and her grandchild why is she crying she is often scared of strangers okay my baby my baby what do you think is the main reason young girls in the ghetto end up in such situations? most of them get attracted to someone because of money they love touts because they make quick cash the girls love being taken for outings and receiving nice treats but one thing they forget is this man is not spending on them for free the lady falls pregnant in the process then later on find out maybe this man had a wife and kids the lady ends up living miserably because what the guy needed was just pleasure touts are very canning, they can do anything including spending all their cash they have as long as they get what they want in the end there are so many single mothers here in Kibagare and most of them are underage Most of them are into drugs, weed, cocaine and some are even injecting themselves some are engaging into witchcraft they take in some stuffs claiming that it makes them invisible when they go out for a mission to steal some are swallowing drugs of different types and colors we have yellow, some white when a person takes in such stuff, it's like they go crazy, you find someone diving in dirty stagnant water claiming that they are in a swimming pool have you ever used them? Yes, mostly alcohol and weed which I used to smoke on daily basis what about now? not any longer because I want to be a good example to my child, I don't want her to engage in what I used to do I also don't want her to go through the life I went though as a young mother I just want our parents to stop mistreating us even though we failed them, let them forgive us we made a mistake but when we repeat the same thing then there's no excuse let them treat us nicely, we have learnt our lesson and we are ready to make amends if it's going back to school we are ready as long as they treat us nicely like before let them also treat our children well since they are their grandchildren I always feel I disappointed my mother from the very day I dropped out of school I always tell from the way she treats me compared to the other children things got worse when I got pregnant because this are the things she used to warn me about these men are just after sex, they cannot help you in any way and in fact most of them know nothing about being responsible I just want her to forgive me and I ask her to be a little bit nice to me because the mistakes I made are now in the past and we can't do anything about it how do you feel when you see girls of your age who have not yet given birth? I am happy for them, I would advice them to take care of themselves and never rush into relationships because it's not easy I am 16 years old and I already have a child, let them know these things will always be there so they should take their time you might rush then end up getting pregnant for a young boy who is still depending on their parents such a man may not be in a position to help you, the money they were using to chase you around with is what they got from their parents are still going to school? no, because there' s no school fees but I can still go back to school should I get money what are your aspirations in future? I just want to be a chef why a chef? I love cooking will you cook something for us today? sure what will you prepare for us? anything you need that's great I want to become a doctor or a comedian I make people laugh in class and I want to feature in Churchill show one day what would you love to engage in? I just want to do a course then work and get money to educate my child and to further my education as well mostly engage in the adult education that is how you want to build yourself? sure then become what in future? I just want to tour around because I love adventure like you want to study a travelling course? yes tourism and tours? yes so that I can travel in all the nice places what do you want your child to become in future? whatever it is that will please her, I can't chose for her as long as it's not working as a tout or engaging in prostitution whatever it is that will make her comfortable? yes What of you Nicole? I want him to become a journalist why? I think it will suit him how do you know? just by looking at him and I am convinced that's the right profession he is camera friendly yes what of you Maria? a police officer who do you want to get arrested? it's not about arresting people aimlessly or killing anyone what if he is given the orders to shoot to kill? he should not kill
