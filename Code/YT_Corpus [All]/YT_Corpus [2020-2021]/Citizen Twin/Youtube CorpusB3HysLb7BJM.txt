 well first of all I mean there are levels of there's sort of a mix of decent arguments and terrible ones and and all of it coated in this sort of like sickly toxic disingenuous mnestheus you just like inhale like paint fumes like it's it's almost too much shirt to fill your brain cells die when a trump lawyer says well we didn't you know gosh we didn't want to bring up Reese MA and by then but the house managers brought it up so well here we go okay I got about 60 pages here on it I mean give me a break let me let me just say this about about that point and you and Mark Werner were discussing this there's a few things about the hunter Biden Brisa thing that really bothered me um first of all I think it's it's fair to say that as an ethical matter or a Prudential matter if you were if or email were was solicited by hunter Biden at that moment to say should I take this gig you'd probably say no don't do it I'd say no don't do it I don't think it was the right thing to do but he's a grown-ass man okay and you are not you do not control the actions of your adult children and if Joe Biden could control the actions of his adult son hunter Biden there's lots of things I think that he would have hunter Biden do differently than things that he has done that does not pertain to Joe Biden first of all second of all he's an American citizen and this is the American from America first presidency we do not sick foreign systems of justice on American citizens we do not do it it is a violation of the fundamental oath of office of the President to protect American citizens we do not have the Chinese go after Americans that we do not take the Ukrainians we have an American system of justice if there is an actual predicate for some sort of investigation there are processes by which that is pursued we simply do not pursue it in the way we do and the third thing about this and the sort of crowning disingenuous nasai think senator you'll join me on this forgive me if i'm miss miss recollecting this i think republicans had a majority of both houses in 2015 and i think they conducted zealous oversight of many issues including benghazi how many hearings were there on burry smut zero how many in the house zero how many in the senate zero how many senators raised the objection at that time it was happening that joe biden was doing something corrupt zero that's the ball game if it was an actual good-faith effort by the republicans who certainly had were no shrinking violets about corruption were misdeeds by the Obama administration they would have said something at the time and they didn't and that's how you know the entire thing has been retro actively reverse engineered solely for political purposes hey I'm already Melbourne from MSNBC you can see more of our videos right here or better yet subscribe to our You Tube channel below you could have been anywhere in the world that you're here with us and we appreciate that
