 Oh finally my turn yeah good afternoon everyone my name is Jim and come from the Tencent Chavis Lowry today I want to talk about the topic of data visualization for the Beeman smart cities about how we can create with the technology of Unreal 4 to improve efficiency service and helping more people in some of the emergency circumstances but before I started I want to play a video shot with you it will tell you what who we are and what do we have done in the past a few years hello how are you Tencent Jeff's lab is part of Penson cloud infrastructure we focused around building knowledge and decision platform to enable a safest in trust experience in both digital and physical world we invest heavily in big data mission learning and data visualization to create a rich solution spanning across medical and healthcare sectors and we're certainly looking forward to partner with Epic Games to boot our reliable advanced solution for our customer in both commercial and consumer sectors Penrose was the first time to use ue4 in the big data visualization field we are always committed to providing our customers with stunning high quality products and services this constantly drives us moving forward at the same time the powerful capabilities of ue4 allow us to turn imaginations into reality and help us grow steadily well mom told me that life is like a box of chocolate well today I finally figure it out from this picture well in the past nine years we have Tran many frameworks and must say that Unreal Engine 4 is the best choice we have ever made well big house answer designer team blueprints gave us a lot of choice to get to the point and it this is how we start our development this is a project code hospital control cabin what we are looking at is the visualization of measurements of a hospital for a 24 hours period which the powerful professional animation tools of Unreal Engine which control the parameters such as lambs slat rose Tomlin etc to create a visualization of a hospital that can manage over 4 million visitors in every year with the we are SDK we can create an immersive experience just like the PDR one actually cancer this is the medical we are project in this case doctors and the patients can interact with the simulation in real time that is convenience for the patients to understand the principle of treatment and using the pixel streaming we can even you can even give a deployed experience to the patient's home recently we are using part of the Unreal Studios data space so we can you reach the beam data and this is a project that we're building the Sinjin expansion center the largest pavilions beauty in the world our solutions captures all the buildings data from almost a 10,000 devices in real time include energy security vehicles and equipment so that we can make the building smart and safety that means when there is nobody for well the building's air conditioner was shut down to save energy and even use the cash technology we can simulate the security arrangement from a wood fire or earthquake based on the changes in the cloud map data with dynamically generate the city model and the render the cities seem but analyze the map data we can transfer the street building and trim perimeters in unreal engine generates the model and the materials in real chance you the render pipeline finally we can get excellent citizen base on days we map the medical condition of the city Changsha in China and then CDC will use it to track the delivery of unusual vaccines visualization disease transmission based on the batteries to processing the bacteria we build update warehouse service any unreal engine the management of data it divided into three parts the dead events processing and rendering which are used to analyze reboot and generate different type of results in two cans of information graphics for the user in young young John Morrison 2018 we use the ROI analyzed model to predict the abnormal data so we can further assistant the service of medical risk you event security track abnormal situation and emergency response in 2011 it was the beginning of Paris we were just a crazy about the beauty of the data we didn't have any grand ambitions but it turned out that Paris service can improve more than 10 million vistas medical user experience every year so we started choosing about this - since Klaus has applied again and real chance simulation in the past we were focused on the games and social networks right now we're committed to the house medical care and even mental governance in the future we want to do something for the city in human beings thank you
