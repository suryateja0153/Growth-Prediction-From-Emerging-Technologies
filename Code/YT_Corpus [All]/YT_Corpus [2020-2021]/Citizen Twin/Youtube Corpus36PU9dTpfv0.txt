 My name is Andrew Young and I'm a puppeteer and visual artist. The piece that we created,   we basically all reached out to people that  we had like a personal connection with in some   way and asked for their stories related to the  uprising. And so we gathered just like some various   stories from the community, and then we kind of added them together, and found where here was some   crossover and places where they diverged and we tried to make that into kind of like a   narrative, and then we created a bunch  of shadow visuals for it. It feels like this   connection to a community that's larger  than i am and also it feels like a connection to   my heritage. My mom is from Indonesia and  there's a strong shadow puppet tradition   there. And then my dad is from Taiwan, and there's both shadow and like rod puppets there. I'm Ty.   I'm a puppeteer, poet, and author. As artists we've been really trying to shift the narratives that   we're telling, and focus on the events that are unfolding in this very difficult time and to speak   to them in a way that's respectful. I mean I think there is, so often, you'll see this story told by   CNN, by ABC, by Fox News, and the people telling  those stories don't necessarily look like   you or me. My name is Rebecca Crisanta de Ybarra.  I am an interdisciplinary artist. I think   from the particular stories that we were able to harvest, there were multiple perspectives    that we also experienced and processed as artists about being on the ground, being torn about not   being able to be on the ground, raising children, that there's multiple roles in a revolution.
