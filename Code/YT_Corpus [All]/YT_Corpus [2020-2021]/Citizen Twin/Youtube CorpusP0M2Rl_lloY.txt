WE WORK WITH A REPRESENTATIVE MASON REPRESENTATIVE FISHER REPRESENT MASON IF YOU WOULD LIKE PRESENT YOUR BILL AND IDEAS TO THE COMMISSION. THANK MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS.  THIS IS A BILL THAT WE DID COVER HERE IN THE HOUSE IT MADE IT OUT OF THE HOUSE COMMITTEE. WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE NUMBER IT CONCERNS ABOUT MET COUNCIL HOPEFULLY THE STAGGER TURN THIS STATE OR TO HIM BILL WE'LL GET MORE REPRESENTATION TO SEE TO THE CITIES AND COUNTIES AND WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS ASK REPRESENTATIVES FROM CERTAIN ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE REALLY SPONSORING THIS TO COME FORWARD AND TESTIFY.

MY NAME IS PATRICIA NAUMAN AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF METRO CITIES WHICH IS AN ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING CITIES IN THE 7 COUNTY. A METROPOLITAN AREA AND WE HAVE THE DISTINCTION OF REPRESENTING CITIES AT THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS AT THE METROPOLITAN COUNCIL. I'LL BE VERY BRIEF TODAY; A METRO CITIES DOES SUPPORT THE PROVISIONS THAT ARE CONTAINED IN HOUSE FILE ONE 92 AND I DO HAVE AND I WILL HAND OUT OR STAFF AT THE COULD ASSIST ME WITH HANDING OUT JUST METRO CITIES GENERAL POLICY ON REGIONAL GOVERNANCE. IT IS AN ISSUE THAT IS OF STRONG INTEREST TO THE ORGANIZATIONS. CITY OFFICIALS AND MEMBERS AND JUST VERY QUICKLY THE POLICY THAT METRO CITIES TO SUPPORT PENDING FREE AGENTS THAT ARE CONTAINED IN HOUSE FILE WHEN 92 DO SUPPORT. STAKER TERMS FOR METROPOLITAN COUNCIL MEMBERS THAT HAS BEEN A LONGSTANDING A POLICY POSITION FOR THE ORGANIZATION AND METRO CITIES ALSO JUST SUPPORTS PROVISIONS IN THE BILL THAT TO EXPAND THE NOMINATING COMMITTEE WHICH IS THE STATUTORY COMMITTEE THAT DOES CONVENE BEFORE THE APPOINTMENT OF MEMBERS BY THE GOVERNOR TO RECOMMEND THAT MEMBERS WE DO SUPPORT HAVING THAT COMMITTEE EXPANDED AND INCREASED TO INCLUDE A MAJORITY OF LOCAL OFFICIALS WHICH IS INCLUDED IN HOUSE BY ONE 92. IN ADDITION; METRO CITIES DOES SUPPORT. PROVISIONS ALSO CONTAIN TO THE BILL THAT TO ADD WHAT WE WOULD CALL AT A TRANSPARENCY FOR THE PROCESS AND INCLUDING THE PUBLIC NOTIFICATION OF MEMBERS BEFORE THEY ARE APPOINTED WHICH ESSENTIALLY ALLOWS FOR A PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD FOR MEMBERS BY THE PUBLIC BEFORE THE GOVERNOR MAKES THOSE I WILL AND THERE AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS FOR YOU TODAY. THANK YOU MISS NOLAN. REPRESENT MISS AND I BELIEVE THERE WAS ANOTHER TESTIFY OR THERE IS ENOUGH AND SHE WENT DOWN AS WELL. THANK YOU.  IT MAY MEMBERS WELL IF IT THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS WILL WAIT TILL THE TOP COUPLE TESTIFY ERS ARE DONE AND THEN WE CAN HAVE OUR DISCUSSION. WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE SAY YOUR NAME AND A MAN PROCEED. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS.  FOR THE RECORD MONEY IS PUT TO A HALF MEN; I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CITIZENS LEE. AND I AM HERE IN SUPPORT OF HOUSE FOUND ONE 92. THAT IS BEING HEARD HERE IN THIS COMMISSION ON THAT PUNT GOVERNMENT TODAY. THE PROPOSED CONCEPTS AND CHANGES TO LAW COVERING THE METROPOLITAN COUNCIL AND HEALTH ONE 92 ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE POSITIONS OF THE CITIZENS LEAGUE THAT CITIZENS; THEY POSITIONS RESULTED FROM RECOMMENDATIONS BY A DIVERSE TASK FORCE THAT WAS CONVENED IN 2015. THE 2016 THAT TASK FORCE INCLUDED LOCAL OFFICIALS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY NONPROFIT SECTOR AND CITIZENS. OVER THE COURSE OF 6 MONTHS THE TEST FOR STUDIED AND DEBATED VARIES GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES INCLUDING IDEAS THAT REPRESENTED IN-HOUSE FALLEN 92. THE CITIZEN 6 REPORTS STAGGERING THE TERMS OF THAT MET COUNCIL MEMBERS EXPANDING THE NOMINATING COMMITTEE ADDING MORE LOCAL OFFICIALS TO THE COMMITTEE AND INCREASING TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE SELECTION PROCESS. SO FOR THIS REASON WE SUPPORT HOUSE WHEN 92 THAT IS BEING SPONSORED BY REPRESENTATIVE MAY SAID. AND I HAVE SOME HANDOUTS FOR YOU OK WE CAN HAVE THIS DISTRIBUTED. IT LIST THE MEMBERS OF THAT 2015 16 TASK FORCE AND ALSO IS AN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS; OKAY.  WELL GET THOSE DISTRIBUTED. AND I THE NEXT TEST THE FIRES APPROACH AND SO. IF YOU CAN STICK AROUND FOR SOME QUESTIONS IF THERE ARE SOME.  THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS CLAIRE ROEBLING AND I REPRESENT SCOTT COUNTY. AND WE DO APPRECIATE REPRESENTATIVE MASON'S ATTEMPT TO TO TRY AND PROVIDE MORE ACCOUNTABILITY CLARITY THROUGH THE THROUGH THE SELECTION PROCESS FOR THE MET COUNCIL. AS MANY OF YOU HEARD BEFORE OUR COUNTY IN AND SEVERAL OTHERS AS WELL; OUR ARE TRULY LOOKING FOR SUCH A PIG OR CHANGED OR HOW THE MET COUNCIL GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE IS IT'S SET UP AND OUR PROPOSAL IS TO ELECTED OFFICIALS SERVE ON THE MET COUNCIL LIKE THEY DO FOR ALL OF THE OTHER AND PEELS SUMMIT PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY. I KNOW OUR SAYS GRANDFATHER BECAUSE WE WERE ONE OF THE VERY FIRST TIME PEELS WE STILL BELIEVE THAT FOR BETTER ACCOUNTABILITY WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE ELECTED OFFICIALS SERVING ON THE COUNCIL. I KNOW THAT THE STATE ARE TERMS. OUR SOMETHING WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE AND IT COULD HELP PREVENT ALL NEW MEMBERS COMING ON THE COUNCIL AT ONE TIME. BUT IN REALITY WE STILL WOULD HAVE THE GOVERNOR THE MAJORITY OF THOSE MEMBERS AS HIS APPOINTEES; ESPECIALLY IN IN AN 8 YEAR DETERMINED TO CUT THE GOVERNOR'S SERVING FOR 8 YEARS AS MANY OF THEM HAVE IN THE RECENT PAST. SO IT'S THE FIRST TIME THE GOVERNOR TO BE ELECTED HE GET TO A POINT HALF OF THE MEMBERS AND THEN IN 2 YEARS HE WOULD GET TO ELECT A POINT THE OTHER CATS AND FOR THOSE FINAL METERS THAT THAT FIRST FOUR-YEAR TERM HE'D HAVE ALL THE APPOINTEES AND THEN IF YOU MOVED INTO ANOTHER FOUR-YEAR TERM. HE'D HAVE THEM ALL FOR ANOTHER 4 YEARS MAYBE 6 YEARS AGO IT UP BE THE SAME PERSON SOME POINT HE'S AND IN REALITY THATS WHO THOSE MEMBERS ARE THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO ITS TO THE GOVERNOR AND WE WANT THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO THE WIDER POPULATION TOOK TO THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL. WE ALSO APPRECIATE HAVING SOME MEMBERS REPRESENTING THE COUNTY'S ON THE NOMINATING COMMITTEES. BUT AGAIN IT STILL GOES BACK TO THE GOVERNOR HAS COMPLETE DISCRETION IN WHO HE'S GOING TO APPOINT HE DOES NOT HAVE TO GO OFF THE NOMINATING BLESSED. HE DOES IN HERE HAVE TO CONSULT WITH BUT NOMINATING COMMITTEE AND PROVIDE A REASON WHY HE WOULD NOT CHOOSE TOP OF THE NOMINATING LIST; BUT HE STILL HAS COMPLETE DISCRETION AND THAT THAT CONTINUES TO BE A CONCERN ABOUT OR 6 MONTHS I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THOSE COMMENTS THANK YOU. WE APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS. A COMMISSIONER. MEMBERS ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS SESSION C. A REPRESENTATIVE FOR CENTER AS MCCLEASE CAREFUL HAHA. TO THE. TO THE AUTHOR; I'M A COUPLE QUESTIONS ONE. WE ARE CURRENTLY IS IT'S BEEN ALLUDED TO WE ARE CURRENTLY NON COMPLIANT WITH THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS REGARDING AND P O'S WHAT IN THIS BILL MOVES US TOWARDS COMPLIANCE. IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE BILL THAT MOVES US TOWARDS COMPLIANCE. NOW THAT WE HAVE.  THIS BILL IS JUST STRICTLY CONCERNED WITH THE ACTUAL MEMBERS K. MISTER CHAIR AND OTHER QUESTIONS CENTER HAS THE WORK ON ABILITIES BROUGHT BEEN BROUGHT UP AT LEAST 3 TIMES BY TEST THE FIRES WHAT PART OF THIS BILL IMPROVES ACCOUNTABILITY OF MET COUNCIL REPRESENTATIVES TO THE DISTRICTS THAT THEY REPRESENT.  THE FACT IS THAT IT DOES GIVE MORE. AUTHORIZATION INVOLVEMENT FROM THE LOCAL. AND AT EASE MEANING CITIES AND COUNTIES NET. AS A FORMER CITY COUNCIL MEMBER I CAN TELL YOU WHEN I SERVED NATIONALLY SERVED ON THE COUNCIL. WE HAVE LITERALLY NO CONTACT WITH OUR MET COUNCIL REPRESENTATIVE AND I THINK OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. WE'VE HAD. IT'S BEEN MUCH MUCH BETTER AND I WILL GIVE YOU THAT BUT THE POINT IS THIS HE IS FOR THE METRO COUNCIL. AND THIS IS MAINLY DEALING WITH THE CITIES AND COUNTIES SO THE IMPETUS IT SHOULD BE TO GET MORE ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE CITIES AND COUNTIES. MISTER CHAIR.  SARAH'S MUM WELL REPRESENTED MASON I HIGHLY DISAGREE WITH YOU THAT THERE IS ANY ACCOUNTABILITY CHANGE IN THIS BILL ANY. I LIVED ICE LIVED A CITY COUNCIL FOR 11 YEARS. SO WE HAVE THAT IN COMMON. I LOVE THE MET COUNCIL REP WHO WAS NOTORIOUSLY NOT DOING WHAT WE ASKED HER TO DO AND HER ANSWER WAS THAT SHE WAS NOT PURSUING. BUT MOUNT NEEDED THE CITY I WAS IN BECAUSE IT WAS THE GOVERNOR'S PREROGATIVE THE HE BELIEVED IN X Y OR Z THIS PARTICULAR CASE WAS ABOUT 4; 4 DOUBLE HOUSING. AND THAT SHE REPORTS TO THE GOVERNOR AND SHE NEEDS TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR IN THE GOVERNOR'S INITIATIVES; NOT THE CITY COUNCIL IN THE AREA THAT SHE REPRESENTS THIS BILL DOES NOTHING TO CHANGE THAT ACCOUNTABILITY. IT DOES CHANGE THE NAME OR CHANGE THE INFLUENCE OF A NOMINATING COMMITTEE; BUT AGAIN IN LIVE PAGE 3 LINES STARTING ON LINE A 17. THE GOVERNOR CAN GO OFF THE BOARD ANY TIME ANY PLACE ANYWHERE HE WANTS TO WITH WRITTEN AND WRITTEN A DISCUSSION OR WRITTEN NOTIFICATION TO INDIVIDUALS SO IF THE GOVERNOR WANTED TO APPOINT. SOMEONE THAT HAS NOT EVEN BEEN SEEN HE CAN THE NOMINATING COMMITTEE IS IS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED IS JUST THE SAME IS CHANGING THE DECK CHAIRS ON THE TITANIC. THERE'S DOES NOTHING. I I GUESS I I HAVE HAD MULTIPLE BILLS IN THE LEGISLATURE. ONE INCLUDING COMPLETELY WIPING THEM OUT AND SENDING ALL THEIR JURISDICTIONAL CONTROL BACK TO OTHER AGENCIES. BUT WE HAVE I HAVE MULTIPLE DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN HEARD BUT NOT ACTED UPON THAT ACTUALLY WOULD MAKE THEM ACCOUNTABLE THAT THEY HAVE TO GO TO THEIR CITY COUNCILS AND ACTUALLY HAVE TO GAIN SUPPORT FROM AT LEAST HALF OF THE CITY COUNCIL'S OF WHICH THERE ARE POINTED TO ITS UNIQUE IDEA; IT MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT. BUT IT ALSO BRINGS IN ACCOUNTABILITY AT THE MET COUNCIL REPS HAVE TO BE PAYING ATTENTION TO THE CITY COUNCIL'S AND NOT JUST THE FILLING WHAT GOVERNOR SAYS BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT THE ROLE IS SO I GUESS I WILL DISAGREE WITH YOU AS FAR AS WHAT THIS DOES TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST. I DON'T SEE REALLY DOING MUCH OF ANYTHING. THANK YOU REPRESENT A MASSIVE AND I RESPOND TO THAT. YES. YES; WE HAVE NO FIRST LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER; THEY ARE HIS FAN. DISSATISFACTION OR CONTROVERSIES CONCERNING THE MET COUNCIL.  AND WE HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO MAKE CHANGES AT LEAST IN THE LAST DECADE OR SO THIS TO ME IS AN ATTEMPT TO AT LEAST GET US MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. I THINK BELIEVE AND A 9. HEARING YOU SAY I THINK YOU KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING A MAJOR MAJOR CHANGE. AND I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT DONE. THIS YEAR. SOME MIGHT SUGGESTING IS WE GET DONE WHAT WE CAN DO TO GET DONE THIS YEAR. AND WE CAN BE WORKING ON SOME OF THE OTHER ASPECTS AS WE'RE GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR; MISTER CHAIR I'D LIKE AND INTERRUPT THIS PROCEEDING AND MAKE A MOTION. WE ARE ON THE AGENDA ITEM NUMBER 2 SO A MOTION WOULD BE OUT OF KNOW A MOTION WOULD SUPERSEDE ANY CONVERSATION OR DEBATE SO MISTER CHAIR I MOVE THAT WE HOLD A NEW ELECTION FOR CHAIR OF THIS COMMISSION. A MEMBER THANK CENTER DOUBLE MEMBERS WE TEST THE FIRES WITH US WE HAVE AN AUDIENCE WITH US. AND. I THINK WE ASKED THE SENATOR DOUBLE REALLY YOU'RE OUT OF BUT BY STATUTE AND BY MASONS MISTER CHAIR I THEN A VOTE TO OVERCOME YOUR RULING AND CALL FOR A ROLL CALL. SENATOR YOU KNOW WE'VE WORKED AND TALKED ABOUT THE ISSUE THAT YOU'RE CONCERNED WITH I'M HERE WE ARE IN A PUBLIC YOU WANT TO BRING MORE PARTISANSHIP INTO THIS I THINK THE OPPORTUNITY OF THIS COMMITTEE AS FOR METRO MEMBERS TO COME TOGETHER. SHARE IDEAS AND HOPEFULLY COME TOGETHER AND HAVE DIALOGUE AND AND MOVE FOR BETTER GOVERNANCE AND SHARE THAT DIALOGUE TOGETHER SO THAT WE CAN ADVANCE FOR THE STATE OF MINNESOTA BETTER IF YOU WANT TO. TRY TO PLAY IN FRONT OF THAT FROM THE PUBLIC HERE AS MUCH AS YOU WE CAN HAVE THAT DISCUSSION. BUT I THINK PEOPLE ARE HERE READY TO HAVE A SERIOUS DISCUSSION ON A NUMBER OF TOPICS AND UH I WANT TO MOVE FOR FOR A RECESS.  MISTER                            HOW 1 ONE.        THANK YOU CALLED THE COMMISSION BACK A RECESS. I APPRECIATE THE PATIENCE OF THE PUBLIC AND THOSE THAT ARE HERE THAT NIGHT. PROBABLY SIDE. POLITICS THE WAY THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE IT AND THEN I'M EMBARRASSED I THINK MINNESOTA SHOULD BE EMBARRASSED AS WELL. WE WILL MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER NUMBER 5 PRESENTATION OF I REPRESENT TERKEL SEN. HOUSE FILE. 3; 1; 1; 0; LIGHT RAIL TRANSIT SAFETY ASSESSMENT. REP WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE REPRESENTATIVE TERKEL KNOW WHEN YOU ARE CHAIR OF THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. WE HAD SOME DISCUSSION ON TRANSIT SAFETY AND APPRECIATE. COMING IN THE INTERIM TO PRESENT THE TOPIC I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TOPIC WERE ALL YOUR SIDE TOW TO LISTEN YOUR PRESENTATION AND HAVE A GOOD DISCUSSION. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR; A HAPPY TO BE HAAS FILE 3110. IS A NEWLY INTRODUCED BILL FOR THIS YEAR; BUT UH CERTAINLY THE ISSUE OF SAFETY AND SECURITY ARE LIGHT RAIL SYSTEM AND ON ON ALL TRANSIT HAS BEEN AN ONGOING TOPIC OF THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT QUITE A BIT IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. ONE THAT I'VE TAKEN AN INTEREST IN. COURSE THAT DON'T LIVE IN THE METRO BUT I DO USE THE SYSTEM AND AS A FORMER CHAIR TRANSPORTATION; I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE STATE; NOT JUST TO ANY CERTAIN PART OF THE STATE. THIS IS REALLY AN EFFORT IN MY MIND TO BRING THIS TOPIC TO THE GIVE A THOROUGH DISCUSSION. YOU KNOW THE SYSTEM IS NOT OPERATED BY THE LEGISLATURE. THE SYSTEM IS OPERATED BY METROPOLITAN UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THE METROPOLITAN COUNCIL. BUT WE WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE METROPOLITAN COUNCIL WE SUPPLY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF A PROMISE FROM STATE COFFERS TO A WITH THE SUPPLY OF A CHANCE IT. SERVICES HERE IN THE METROPOLITAN AREA. I'M SURE THIS YEAR'S A BONDING BILL WILL HAVE SOME REQUESTS OH 4 STATE FUNDS TO HELP PURCHASE NEW EQUIPMENT THOMAS SYSTEM TO SYSTEM THAT WE'VE INVESTED. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN. WE HAVE ANOTHER THE LARGEST PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT IN HISTORY. THE STATE IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION IN THE SOUTHWEST METRO. ANOTHER $2 BILLION PLUS SO OF INVESTMENT OF STATE AND COUNTY AND FEDERAL MONEY. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO TO EVERYONE THAT THIS SYSTEM. WORK WELL AND THAT PEOPLE FEEL SAFE WHEN THEY'RE WRITING IT; I DO HAVE A HANDOUT. MISTER CHAIR EVERY TIME THAT I MY NAME HAS BEEN MENTIONED IN A NEWS ARTICLE REGARDING THIS ISSUE. I GET MORE E-MAILS FROM CONCERNED CITIZENS; I'VE JUST TAKEN A FEW EXCERPTS HEAR FROM SOME OF THE EMAILS I'VE GOTTEN JUST TO KIND OF DEMONSTRATE THAT IT'S NOT JUST A ONE OFF THING THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF FOLKS THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR SAFETY WHEN THEY ARE USING THE SYSTEM. I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WRITE AND OTHER SYSTEMS AROUND THE COUNTRY. MOST RECENTLY IN SACRAMENTO; CALIFORNIA. I WAS JUST THERE OVER THE MLK WEEKEND. JUST SO HAPPENED TO RIDE THEIR LIGHT RAIL TRAIN TWICE. IN THE HOME DURING THE WEEK AND I WAS THERE ON ONE OF THOSE TRIPS THERE ISN'T A UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICER ON THE CAR. SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S TYPICAL BUT YOU FOR ME IT WAS A 5050 DEAL. WRITTEN THE LIGHT RAIL SYSTEM IN DENVER FROM THE AIRPORT TO DOWNTOWN DENVER AND HAD MY TICKET CHECKED TWICE ON THE SAME TRIP. I'VE WRITTEN THE SYSTEM HERE IN THE METROPOLITAN AREA; MANY TIMES THEY HAVEN'T COUNTED. BUT OF ALL THOSE RIDES I'VE ONLY HAD MY TICKET EVER CHECKED ONE TIME. FARE EVASION IS CERTAINLY A REAL ISSUE; BUT IT'S JUST ONE OF MANY ISSUES SURROUNDING SAFETY AND SECURITY ON OUR LIGHT RAIL SYSTEM. THIS BILL CONTAINS A NUMBER OF IDEAS. SOME OF THEM ARE ALREADY BEING ADDRESSED BY THE TOWN COUNCIL SUCH AS THE SECURITY CAMERAS. I UNDERSTAND IN SOME I BELIEVE IT'S IN SACRAMENTO. I DIDN'T EXPERIENCE THIS BUT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE BUT WHERE THEY HAVE LIVED SECURITY CAMERAS ON THE PLATFORM AND IF SOMEBODY IS MISBEHAVING THEY CAN CALL OUT TO OVER A LOUDSPEAKER AND LET THEM KNOW THEY'RE MISBEHAVING ON SKY INTERESTING AT ALL THAT WOULD WORK HERE IN OUR AREA OR NOT MISTER CHAIR. I WE HAVE SOMEONE HERE THAT WORKS; I'M A LIGHT RAIL SYSTEM THAT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY. I'M SURE THAT PERSON KNOWS A LOT MORE ABOUT THIS THAN I EVER WILL THE THANK YOU REPRESENTATIVE TERKEL CENT AND A LOT OF THE DISCUSSION THAT WE'VE HAD THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL  FOCUSES ON RIDERS OBVIOUSLY THAT'S. VERY BUT I HAVE ALSO RECEIVED A LOT OF THE E-MAILS AND PHONE CALLS TO MY OFFICE. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO. THE CONCERN WITH THE OPERATORS THE PEOPLE THAT ARE DRIVING THE LIGHT RAILS AND DRIVING THE BUS AS WE'VE SEEN. NEWS REPORTS OF ASSAULTS A BUS DRIVERS. MET COUNCIL WILL PRESENT A LITTLE BIT AFTER THAT BUT. MS DARLIN I BELIEVE. YOU'RE WELCOME DO UP. SET NEXT TO A REPRESENTATIVE TERKEL SON AND A SHARE YOUR COMMENTS WITH THE COMMISSION PLEASE. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS. FOR ALLOW ME TO SKEWS ME IF YOU COULD ALSO JUST PLEASE A STATE YOUR NAME FOR THE RECORD IN. AND THEN NOT PROCEED. MY NAME IS SONNY DARLING; I'M A LIGHT RAIL OPERATOR. THIS THE FIRST MEETING LIKE THIS I'VE BEEN TO SO IT'S BEEN EDUCATIONAL SO THANK YOU.  A LOT OF THE FOCUS IN THE MEDIA HAS BEEN ON THE PUBLIC AND THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE PUBLIC SAFETY. BUT ONE THING THAT GETS LEFT OUT IS THE WORKERS. WE HAVE THE TRAIN OPERATORS AND WE HAVE CLEANERS ON THE PLATFORM THAT ARE CONSTANTLY ASSAULTED VERBALLY PHYSICALLY. THERE'S NOT MUCH THAT HAPPENS IT GETS REPORTED. WEEK POLICE COME BY THAT TIME USUALLY THE CRIMINALS GONE. WHEN WE HAVE A CRIMINAL ACTIVITY ON THE TRAIN. IT GOES ON ALL NIGHT. WE HAVE WENT DEAF EARS. I'M PLEADING OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS. FOR MANAGEMENT. SAFETY DEPARTMENT GRIEVANCES SAFETY REPORTS. I'M BEGGING PEOPLE TO PLEASE LISTEN TO US AND HELP US WITH OUR SAFETY; I'VE GOT OPERATORS THAT ARE SCARED TO COME TO WORK. THEY'RE WONDERING IF THEY'RE GOING MAKE IT HOME. WE'VE HAD MURDERS ON THE PLATFORM. WE'VE HAD MURDERS ON OUR TRAIN. WE'VE HAD RAPES NUMEROUS RAPES. AT ANY GIVEN NIGHT. THERE ARE IN EXCESS OF A 100 PEOPLE RIDING THE TRAIN. HALF OF THEM ARE FULLY CLOTHED THEY'RE DRINKING THEY'RE DOING DRUGS. URINATING DEFECATING ON THE TRAIN. WHAT WE CALL THE SUN. WE'RE LUCKY OF POLICE MEET UP WITH US. IT'S IT'S NEVER HOLD YOUR TRAIN AND WEIGHT WHICH IS WHAT SHOULD BE DONE. INSTEAD POLICE WILL MEET UP WITH YOU SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE. MORNING RUSH HOUR FOLKS STANDING ROOM ONLY ON THE TRAIN THEY HAVE TO WITNESS THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR AND YOU WITH IT THE TRAIN SMELL SO BAD. IPAD HAD THEIR JOBS THREATENED. ARE. YOU WOULD THINK THAT IF WE'RE IN A CAB WITH THE DOOR CLOSED THAT WERE NOT SUBJECT TO ANY OF THIS BEHAVIOR WE DON'T HAVE ANY OF THE SMELLS BUT OUR AIR SYSTEM COMES FROM THE PASSENGER COMPARTMENT. AND IF YOU TRY OPENING A WINDOW THERE'S A VACUUM SYSTEM THAT IT'S EVEN WORSE. SO WE'VE HAD AN OPERATOR TO HAD TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE OF THE DRUG USAGE. I'M ON THE TRAIN; THE SMELLS ON THE TRAIN HE HAD TO HAVE SOME MEDICATION. HE ASKED IF HE COULD WEAR A MASK MANAGEMENT ACTUALLY THREATENED TO SEND HIM BACK TO THE BUS SAID THAT HE WAS NOT QUALIFIED TO DRIVE THE TRAIN IF HE CANNOT HANDLE. SMELLS FROM ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF DRUGS. I'M COMING INTO HIS CAB. SO HE'S HAD HIS JOB THREATENS. AT NIGHT WE HAVE TO CLEAR OUR TRAIN GET EVERYONE OFF YOU CAN'T PULL HIM INTO THE YARD FOR THE TRAINS TO BE SERVICED IN CLEAN WITH PEOPLE ON THE TRAIN. MOST PEOPLE ARE PASSED OUT SLEEPING THEY APP THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE WAKE THAT REFUSED TO GET OFF TO GET OFF THE TRAIN. POLICE COME IT COULD TAKE 20 MINUTES. I'VE SEEN IT TAKE AN HOUR AND A HALF BEFORE POLICE COME THE TRAIN IS JUST PART AT CEDAR RIVERSIDE WAITING FOR THE POLICE TO COME. WHEN POLICE DO KICK HIM OFF THE TRAIN. I THAT OPERATORS THAT GET FOR RAIDED BY THE POLICE WHY DON'T YOU MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT THEY GET OFF FOR ME. BUT WE ACTUALLY GET CUSSED AT WE GET THREATENS. GOING TO THE TAIL TRACK. IT'S A PART OF THE TRACK THAT'S BY HEYWOOD TOWERS. IN DOWNTOWN. WE ACTUALLY HAVE OPERATORS THAT WHEN THE TRAIN PULLS IN YOU HAVE TO GET OUT AND GO TO THE OTHER IN TO OPERATE THE TRAIN. THERE ARE PEOPLE PARTY AND DOING DRUGS DO NOT LISTEN TO ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM OPERATORS TO GET OFF THE TRAIN THAT IS RESTRICTED AREA. I HAVE ASKED FOR THE POLICE WHEN I LEAVE THE MALL OF AMERICA WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY 45 MINUTES BEFORE YOU GET STARTED FIELD; I'VE ASKED POLICE HAVE THE POLICE BEAT ME AT TARGET FIELD. THE ANSWER IS NO. THEY'RE THEY'RE OUT ON ANOTHER CALL. YOU NEED TO TRY TO SWEEP YOUR TRAIN. YOU NEED TO SWITCH INS. WHILE ALL THESE PEOPLE IF THEY'RE SLEEPING. I PERSONALLY DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM. BUT WHEN THEY'RE AWAKE AND THEY REFUSED TO GET OFF THE TRAIN. THEY'RE DOING DRUGS THEIR PARTY IN THEY'RE HANGING OUT OPERATORS HAVE TO WALK THROUGH THIS IN A DARK AREA WHERE NO ONE CAN GET TO THEM BY VEHICLE YOU WOULD HAVE TO WALK DOWN THERE. POLICE NEED TO BE THERE EITHER ON EVERY TRAIN FOR A WHILE UNTIL THIS CRIMINAL ACTIVITY ENDS. AND THEY NEED TO BE AT TARGET FIELD TO EITHER CLEAR THE TRAIN OUT BEFORE IT GOES INTO THE TAIL TRACKED OR THEY NEED TO ESCORT THE OPERATOR. WE HAVE SEVERAL OPERATORS THAT ARE SCARED LIKE I SAID ONE OPERATOR HAD CALLED. THE OTHER NIGHT AT THE MALL ARE AT THE AIRPORT DO IN THE SHUTTLE. INDIVIDUAL THAT WAS DRUNK OR ON SOMETHING. HEAD WAS CHASING HIM AROUND AND TAKEN HIS SHOES AND HIS CLOTHING OFF AND THROWING THEM AT THE OPERATOR. THE OPERATOR MANAGES TO GET INTO THE CAB LOCKS THE DOOR AND CALLS CONTROL CENTER RCC AND ASKS THEM IF THEY COULD SEND THE POLICE. POLICE WERE GOING TO BE DELAYED BECAUSE THIS IS AT TERMINAL ONE. SO HE ASKED IF HE COULD SHUT THE DOORS BECAUSE HE WAS SCARED AND THE PARK THE TERMINAL A COUPLE MINUTES EARLY RCC SUPERVISOR TOLD HIM NO YOU NEED TO STAY THERE. AND WAIT AND SO OBVIOUSLY BRINGS UP CONCERNED ARE WE MORE WORRIED ABOUT A SCHEDULE OR SAFETY OF PEOPLE'S LIVES. I'M JUST BECAUSE THIS IS AN OPERATOR DOESN'T MEAN IT'S ANY LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE PUBLIC. YOU NEED TO HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE RULES I GO TO WORK AND I BREAK THE RULES I DON'T LOSE MY JOB. HOWEVER PEOPLE ON THE TRAIN. TERRORIZING IT. WE HAVE THEM RIPPING THE SEATS OFF STEALING THEM. ACTUALLY OPENING A COMPARTMENT WHERE SAY IN THAT HELP STOP THE TRAIN IN AN EMERGENCY THEY ACTUALLY GET TO KATE IN THIS. NOW IF THE TRAIN NEEDS TO STOP IN AN EMERGENCY THE SANDER; IT'S NOT COMING OUT ON THE TRACKS TO HELP THE TRAIN STOPPED. SAFETY PROBLEM. IF YOU TAKE CARE OF YOUR EMPLOYEES I PROMISE YOU THEY WILL TAKE CARE OF YOUR BUSINESS. AND THAT'S WHAT'S LACKING FROM THE MET COUNCIL AND MANAGEMENT THAT LIGHT RAIL. THERE'S A LOT OF MUCH NEEDED MONEY THAT TRANSPORTATION RECEIVES BUT IS WASTED AT LIGHT RAIL MADE UP POSITIONS PROMOTING PEOPLE THAT ARE FAMILY MEMBERS WHEN WE ASKED FOR VENTILATION SYSTEM SO WE CAN HAVE FRESH AIR AND NOT BREED SMOKE AND DRUGS IN OUR CAMPS. THEY TELL US IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE. HOWEVER THE CAMERA LIGHT CAMERA SYSTEM. I THINK THAT'S GREAT BUT I THINK WE'RE AHEAD OF OURSELVES FIRST WE NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE ON THE TRAIN OFFICERS SECURITY THAT ARE TAKING CARE OF THESE PROBLEMS LIFE CAMERA IS NOT GOING TO DO YOU ANY GOOD THAT A COP OR RCC CAN WATCH WHAT'S GOING ON ON THE TRAIN. IF PEOPLE ARE NOT THERE. WE HAVE ONE OF THE LARGEST POLICE FORCE METRO TRANSIT DOES. HOWEVER WE DON'T HAVE POLICE OFFICERS VERY MANY AT NIGHT. YOU NEED TO STOP HIRING OFFICERS; THE CANNOT WORK NIGHTS AND WEEKENDS. ALL THE OFFICERS ARE OUT IN THE DAY WHEN MOST OF THE CRIMINALS ARE SLEEP ON THE TRAIN. THEY'RE NOT REALLY CAUSING PROBLEMS AT THAT POINT OTHER THAN THE FACT THERE'S NOWHERE TO SIT. WE HAVE DANGEROUS HAZARDS. RIDING UP AND DOWN THE TRACKS. THE PEOPLE ARE GETTING ON IN THIS IS WHAT THEY'RE WRITING IN. FLOODING USED LADEE NEEDLES. CRACKED PIPES. THIS IS SEEN ALL THE TIME OUR TRACK PERSONNEL THAT WALKS UP AND DOWN THE TRACKS THAT CLEANS THE TRASH HAS TO CARRY. AN ACTUAL. CONTAINER FOR NEEDLES A SHARP CONTAINER FOR MEALS BECAUSE THEY HAVE THEY HAVE SO MANY NEEDLES THEY HAVE TO PICK UP IN THE RIGHT AWAY AND ON THE TRAINS. ALL THEY HAVE IS RUBBER GLOVES. THAT'S IT AND THEY'RE PICKING UP DIRTY NEEDLES AND THIS IS WHAT THE PUBLIC SEATS. WE PULL INTO THE MALL OF AMERICA AND SECURITY STANDS THERE AND THEY LATE AT NIGHT THEY WILL NOT LET ANYBODY OFF OUR TRAIN. BECAUSE THEY'RE CRIMINALS. THEY'RE DOING CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR ON THE TRAIN. THE MALL OF AMERICA IS CLOSED AND THEY DON'T WANT THEM THERE. I HAVE PEOPLE THE LAST 2 WEEKENDS. GET OFF MY TRAIN EARLY IN THE MORNING MALL OF AMERICA SECURITIES STANDING THERE AND THESE WOMEN DROP THEIR PANTS AND URINATE ALL OVER THE PLATFORM. EVERYONE YOU WALK THERE. YOU GET ON YOUR SHOES; YOU MAKE IT ON A STROLLER PUT YOUR PURSE DOWN YOU GET ON THAT AND YOU TAKE IT HOME. MALL OF AMERICA TELLS US SECURITY THAT IT'S NOT THEIR JURISDICTION. BUT THEY'D MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE DO NOT STAY ON THEIR PLATFORMS. THE AIRPORT IS THE SAME LIKE LATE NIGHT TRAINS. GO SEE THE AIRPORT AIRPORT POLICE ARE STANDING ON THE PLATFORMS AND UNLESS YOU HAVE A SUITCASE AND LOOK LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO GET ON A PLANE. THEY WILL NOT LET YOU OFF THE TRAIN. THEIR EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN ASSAULTED. SO IF MALL OF AMERICA'S SECURITY AND THE AIRPORT POLICE NOTICE. WHAT WE ARE BRINGING INTO THEIR AREAS AND THAT WE DON'T CARE ABOUT ANYBODY SAFETY. THEN TELL ME WHAT IT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT THAT IF THEY REALIZE THAT WHY CAN'T WE DO SOMETHING. I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S COLD OUTSIDE AND THE HOMELESS DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO GO I GET THAT AND THIS IS NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT IT'S ABOUT THE CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. MET COUNCIL HAS THEIR HANDS IN HOUSING. WHY CAN'T YOU DO SOMETHING TO HAVE HOUSING FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WRITE THE TRAIN IS IT BECAUSE THERE'S NO MONEY THAT YOU THAT YOU GET OUT OF THAT IDEA. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S OK TO HAVE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE LAYING AROUND ON THE TRAIN. I'M SLEEPING. DOING WHATEVER THEY WANT. AND IT'S OK PEOPLE COME INTO THE TWIN CITIES AND THEY WANT TO USE THE TRANSIT SYSTEM. THIS IS WELCOME TO THE TWIN CITIES COME ON HERE AND LOOK AT THESE DIRTY NEEDLES CRACK PIPES; HALF NAKED PEOPLE LAYING ALL OVER. IT'S A MESS THERE'S NOWHERE TO SIT. IT'S IT'S EMBARRASSING. I LOVE DRIVING THE TRAIN. I LOVE MY JOB; I'VE BEEN IN TRANSPORTATION FOR MOST 18 YEARS AND I'VE BEEN A RAIL OPERATOR FOR LITTLE OVER 6. I LOVE IT. BUT IT'S EMBARRASSING. IT'S EMBARRASSING TO HAVE THIS GO ON. I'VE HAD A MAN THAT WAS PASSED OUT WITH HIS PEANUTS IN HIS HAND AT THE MALL OF AMERICA IN MORNING RUSH HOUR. AND I'VE CALLED RCC RAIL CONTROL CENTER TO TELL THEM. THEY SAID THE POLICE WILL MEET UP. MORNING RUSH HOUR I HIT BY THE TIME I HIT AMERICAN AVENUE. STATION THE TRAIN IS STANDING ROOM ONLY BY PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOURSELVES TRYING TO COME TO WORK USE THE SYSTEM FOR WHAT IT'S MADE FOR INCOME TO WORK AND THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS MAN'S P MISS WHILE THEY'RE COMING TO WORK A LOT OF PEOPLE BRING THEIR CHILDREN. THEY HAVE DAYCARE DOWNTOWN OR SOMEWHERE ALONG THE RAIL AND THIS IS WHAT THEIR KIDS HAVE TO SEE. I AM EMBARRASSED AND I'M SORRY THAT MY COUNSEL SHOULD BE ASHAMED. THIS IS IT THIS IS HUMILIATING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I DO HAVE A LETTER FROM THE OPERATOR TOOK US TIME AND WROTE. I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY GOOD AND I'D LIKE YOU TO HAVE IT SIR. DID YOU WANT TO READ THE LETTER 41 WELL WE'RE GETTING SHORT ON TIME SO. HE'S ACTUALLY YEAR FEE. BUT IF YOU'D LIKE HIM TO READ IT TO YOU IT PROBABLY MEANS MORE COMING FROM HIM IF THAT'S OK SURE. WELCOME TO THE COMMISSION UP FOR THE RECORD IF YOU COULD. THIS IS STATE YOUR NAME AND THEN READ YOUR LETTER I AM A LIGHT RAIL OPERATOR ON THE BLUE LINE OK; I'M SORRY I WAS TALKING COULD COULD YOU STATE YOUR NAME AGAIN.  MY NAME'S JEFF TO SEE COLOR. OK GO AHEAD PROCEED. THIS IS JUST WHAT I WROTE. I CAME TO METRO TRANSIT IN OCTOBER OF 2017 A GROUP PART TIME BUS AT NJ OUR GARAGE FOR 8 MONTHS. BECAUSE SUMMER 2018 A GROUP FULL-TIME BUS THAT NICKEL. A RUSSIAN FEBRUARY 2019 I TRANSFERRED FINALLY TO WHERE I WANTED TO ALWAYS GO. THE LIGHT RAIL. I RETIRED FROM MY TRUCK DRIVING JOB 30 YEARS BACK IN OHIO SOLD MY HOUSE MOVED FROM OHIO TO COON RAPIDS SPECIFICALLY TO DO LIGHT RAIL FOR METRO TRANSIT. I WENT THROUGH 9 WEEKS OF TRAINING AND TURNED OUT SUCCESSFULLY AS A LIGHT RAIL OPERATOR. TO THE THINGS I NOTICED ABOUT LIGHT RAIL WAS MUCH MORE INTENSE FOCUS ON SAFETY IN SIGNALS. FOCUS ON THESE 2 FACTORS IS A FULL TIME JOB. IT'S IMPORTANT YOU KNOW I TRY TO SAFE RIGHT FOR PEOPLE FROM POINT A TO POINT B. AND FOCUSING ON THAT SAFETY IS EVERYTHING THAT I WAS TRAINED TO DO AND IT'S WHAT IT'S WHAT I DO BEST. OVER THE LAST YEAR LIGHT RAIL OPERATION MY JOB IT'S GOTTEN MUCH MORE DANGEROUS AND UNSAFE. PUTTING THE SAFETY OF ME AND MY PASSENGERS AT RISK. I NO LONGER FEEL SAFE AT WORK AND DEALING IN ADDITION TO THE JOB IT WAS TRAINED TO DO WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE BELLIGERENT AND VIOLENT TOWARD OTHERS IN TOWARD MYSELF. THEY'RE DRUNK ON DRUGS. GANGS OF YOUTH AND THE LIGHTING THE TRAINS KICKING IN DOORS TO UNUSED OPERATORS CADS CRACKING AND BREAKING WINDOWS VANDALIZING AND DESTROYING SEAT AND THREATENING IN CAUSING FIGHTS WITH OTHER PASSENGERS. AND DEALING WITH HOMELESS PEOPLE WHO URINATE DEATH OF KATE PEW AND TRASH UP MY TRAINS. I HAVE PASSENGERS SMOKING CIGARETTES CIGARETTES AND MARIJUANA REGULARLY. DRINKING BEER AND BOOZE OPENLY PEOPLE SELLING AND USING DRUGS ON BOARD; INCLUDING LEAVING THEIR BLOOD TO USE NEEDLES BEHIND ON THE PORTS AND ON THE SEAT WHEN I RUN THE LATE NIGHT TRAINS MANY ARE PASSED OUT AND SLEEPING. SOMETIMES SO MANY. BUT THERE ARE FEW PLACES FOR PAYING CUSTOMERS TO STAND LET ALONE SET. REQUIRED ALSO AT THE END OF MY RUN TO CLEAR THE PASSENGERS. SO I CAN PULL THAT TRAIN IN FOR CLEANING AND MAINTENANCE. RARELY CAN I DO THIS. MANY ARE PASSED OUT AND I CAN'T WAKE THEM AND WHAT AND WHEN I DO WAKE THEM; I'M AFRAID. THEY WILL LUNGED AT ME WITH A KNIFE OR A GUN. MANY REFUSED TO LEAVE THE TRAIN. AND TELL ME TO CALL THE POLICE THEY DON'T CARE THEN I HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE POLICE TO ARRIVE TO CLEAR THE TRAIN. SO I CAN PULL THAT TRAIN IN SOMETIMES THE POLICE TAKE HOURS TO HER RIGHT.

IT'S ALARMING I'M IN BUT IT DOES MATCH UP WITH MANY OF THE THINGS I'VE BEEN HEARING ANECDOTALLY FROM FROM PASSENGERS ON THIS SYSTEM. I DON'T THINK THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO TAKE OVER AND TRY AND RUN OF THE LIGHT RAIL SYSTEM. IT'S METROPOLITAN TRANSIT AND MET COUNCIL'S JOB TO GET THIS BACK IN ORDER. THEY'RE TAKING SOME STEPS BUT I'M NOT SURE THEY'RE BEING AGGRESSIVE ENOUGH AND I LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER DISCUSSIONS AROUND THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU REPRESENTATIVE RON BACK.

AND I KNOW THAT WE HAD A HEARING THE THEN CHIEF HARRINGTON A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO; AND YOU ARE THE CHAIR OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE AND THERE WERE SOME STEPS TAKEN AS A RESULT OF THAT BUT I THINK WE DO NEED TO ACT ON THIS AND THE SESSION LEGISLATIVELY. I DON'T THINK WE HAD BILLS AT THAT TIME. AND I KNOW SOME PROGRESS AND HAVE SOME IDEAS HERE BEFORE US AND HOUSE FELL 3110 REPRESENT HAPPY HAS SOME IDEAS AND SO IT'S MY INTENTION OF THE FRUSTRATION FINANCE A COMMITTEE TO HEAR THESE IDEAS AND AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN BORROW FROM BOTH THESE BILLS AND MOVE FORWARD WITH SOMETHING RELATIVELY EARLY IN THE SESSION; SO AND THIS IS A COOLER AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE I A A BENEFICIARY OF US SENATOR DOUBLE SUNDAY.

THANK YOU REPRESENTATIVE HORNSTEIN I APPRECIATE THAT COMMITMENT TONIGHT I THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO. A SHOW THAT THIS COMMISSION ACTUALLY CAN WORK TOGETHER ON SOME IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT AS IS IMPORTANT TOO. OUR CONSTITUENTS; REPRESENTATIVE RUN BACK AS A QUESTION AND THEN I WILL HAVE THE MET COUNCIL GIVE THE PRESENTATION AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL START ENOUGH TIME FOR FOR THE DISCUSSION.  REPRESENTING MISTER CHAIR; I WAS JUST HOPING WE WOULD HEAR SOME RESPONSE OH NO WE WANT A LONGER HEARING ON THIS; BUT IF THERE IS GOING TO BE SOME RESPONSE FROM THEM THAT LIKE MY QUESTION ARE THEY OTHER RESPONDING TO THE INFORMATION WE HAVE HEARD MISTER CHAIR TOOK THEM TO THE MET COUNCIL. YES; WE HAVE SOME OF THEIR REPRESENTATIVES TODAY BECAUSE WE DID CHANGE THE MEETING TO ACCOMMODATE AS MANY OF THE MEMBERS AS WE COULD. THE NEW CHAIRS ALI WAS UNABLE TO BE HERE FOR PREVIOUS COMMITMENTS; AS WELL AS THE CHIEF OF POLICE. SO THAT WELL; IT'S STILL GOOD TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR AS TO BELIEVE MISTER CHAPMAN. ALL RIGHT REPRESENTATIVE MASON THE GO AHEAD MAKE YOU MISTER CHAIR THEY DID MENTION THE FACT THAT THERE ARE LIVE CAMERAS ON BOARD AND. THE SECURITY POLICE TO MIGHT BE HELPFUL. TO TELL US EXACTLY WHO IS WATCHING THE CAMERAS AND THEN ALSO WHERE ARE THE THEY COULD SECURITY PLEASE FOR LIGHT RAIL. OKAY; IF I IF IT'S NOT COVERED FOR FREEDOM. ASK AGAIN AND PRINTED IN DISCUSSION. MISTER SHANNON; THANK YOU FOR BEING AT THE MY APOLOGIES TO.  THE INVITED GUESTS THAT WE HAD TO JUGGLE SCHEDULES AROUND KIND OF HARD WHEN WE DON'T HAVE A STANDING A COMMITTEE TO GET 14 MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE TOGETHER BUT APPRECIATE THEIR EFFORTS AND I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE AND IF YOU WE DID HAVE TO CUT OUT A LITTLE BIT ON THE THE BUS DRIVER ISSUE; BUT I LEAVE IT UP TO YOU WE'VE GOT ABOUT 20 MINUTES. I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE THAT MUCH TIME IF YOU CAN HAVE ABOUT 10 MINUTES OR SO AND THEN MAYBE SOME MEMBER QUESTIONS. THEY WILL MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF NAME IS JUDGE SHANNON; THE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS DIRECTOR FOR THE MET COUNCIL.  AND THANKS FOR THE UPDATE TO BE JUST TO FOLLOW UP AND WHAT THAT CHAIR COSMIC MENTIONED. HERE'S ALI OUR GENERAL MANAGER METRO TRANSIT QUEST PLACED ROUGH. ARE NOT TODAY FOR THE PREVIOUS MEETINGS THAT WE HAD SET WE WERE PREPARED TO HAVE THE CHAIRMAN AND THE GENERAL MANAGER AVAILABLE. EVEN IF THE MEETING WAS IN THE 10 O'CLOCK THIS MORNING. AND SO IT IS DEFINITELY A SLIGHT TO ANYONE THAT SHARES ONLY FOR OUR GENERAL MANAGER ARE NOT HERE AND I WANT EVERYBODY TO KNOW THAT BECAUSE WE WE WENT SO FAR AS TO REPRESENT COSMIC IN HIS DISTRICT THAT SPEAK WITH GENERAL MANAGER LES PLACE TO IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THEY KNEW THAT WE WERE TAKING THIS AS SERIOUS AS A AS WHAT WE'RE HEARING ABOUT TODAY SO. I THINK OUT TRY TO RESPOND TO A SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE OR JUST HANG TIGHT AND THE BUS DRIVER. A PIECE HERE AND IF WE HAVE A FEW MINUTES AND WE'LL GET TO THAT BUT THE I JUST WANT FOLKS TO KNOW THAT THIS IS REALLY DIFFICULT FOR US TO HEAR AS WELL AND WE TAKE OUR TRANSIT SAFETY VERY VERY SERIOUS AND I WANT TO RESERVE OUR COMMENTS RELATED TO WHAT WE'RE DOING FOR OUR CHAIRMAN AND FOR OUR GENERAL MANAGER I THINK IS MOST APPROPRIATE FOR THEM TO DO THAT AND THEY WILL NOW BE HAPPY TO DO THAT I KNOW THAT REPRESENTATIVE PORN SCENE HAS CALLED A MEETING OF HIS COMMITTEE NEXT THURSDAY TO TALK ABOUT REPRESENT TAP. THESE BILL. BOTH ARE GENERAL MANAGER AND CHAIRMAN WILL BE THERE SO THE SUN THE HOUSE SIDE WILL HAVE OPPORTUNITY THAT ASKED QUESTIONS OF THEM AND WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING. BUT I DO IT IS DIFFICULT TO HEAR THAT AND AND WE KNOW THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE AND I YOU KNOW WE VIEW THE LEGISLATURE'S OUR PARTNER WITH THIS AND I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IN THE PAST AS WELL AND FRANKLY WE NEED YOUR HELP TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE PURSUING I DO WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE HAVE INVESTED AND CURRENTLY TO HELP DEAL WITH THIS; BUT IT IS NOT THE TOTAL SOLUTION TO THIS AND WE KNOW IT BUT WITH THAT WE HAVE ADDED ADDITIONAL. TIME FOR OUR POLICE OFFICERS OVER TIME WE'VE ALSO IMPROVED OUR TEXT TO SAFETY. SO IF SOMETHING IS HAPPENING ON THE TRAIN THAT THERE IS OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO RECORD REACT TO THAT MORE QUICKLY WE HAVE A AS WAS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY WE DO NOW HAVE LIVE CAMERAS ARE GOING TO BE INSTALLED ON OUR TRAINS WHICH WE HOPE WE'LL BE ABLE TO BE A FORCE MULTIPLIER FOR US THAT IS GOING TO ALLOW US TO REACT THE ISSUES QUICKER AND THE LAST PIECE OF IT THAT WE ARE NEEDING YOUR HELP ON AT LEAST RIGHT HERE. IS OUR IDEA TO BRING FORWARD A A ABILITY TO HAVE SOMEONE OTHER THAN A POLICE OFFICER BE ABLE TO WRITE A TICKET AND BE ABLE TO CHECK FARES AND HAVE THAT PRESENCE ON THE TRAIN BECAUSE WE THINK THAT THAT WILL HAVE A CALMING EFFECT HOPEFULLY IF WE HAVE MORE PRESENCE THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM THAT THAT WILL HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE HAPPENING. NOW IS THAT THE WHOLE SOLUTION KNOW I'LL BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT IT'S NOT A KNOW WINTER'S ELLIOTT'S HERE. HE WILL TELL YOU THE SAME AS WELL AS OUR GENERAL MANAGER BUT WE NEED THE LEGISLATURE IN ORDER TO ALLOW US TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THAT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW STATUTE ONLY ALLOWS A SWORN POLICE OFFICER TO BE ABLE TO WRITE THAT TICKET WE'RE PROPOSING TO REPRESENTATIVE PAT KEPT HIS BILL THROUGH A PROPOSAL THAT WE BROUGHT FORWARD LAST SESSION WITH REPRESENTATIVE MASON AND SEN FRANZEN ALLOWED US TO LOOK AT HOW WE WOULD PUT FORWARD AN ADMINISTRATIVE CITATIONS PROGRAM. REPRESENT KEPT HIS BILL GOES FURTHER WITH THAT AND I AM ASKING YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU COULD HELP US BRING THAT FORWARD BECAUSE WE NEED YOUR HELP ON THAT JUST EXPAND ON THAT A BIT FURTHER; BUT WE ALSO ARE PROPOSING TO DO WITH THAT BILL IS TO CHANGE THE FARE EVASION A PENALTY FROM A GROSS MISDEMEANOR TO A PETTY MISDEMEANOR PUTTING IT ON PAR WITH UNPAID PARKING TICKET; CURRENTLY IF YOU GET A FARE EVASION TICKET. YOU ARE AGAIN BEING CHARGED WITH A MISDEMEANOR AND THAT $180 FINE. WE THINK THAT'S MORE ON COURT WITH A. THE MISDEMEANOR AND THEN THAT ALSO ALLOWS THE SENATE TO HAVE THOSE OTHER AMBASSADORS AGENTS FAIR CHECKERS WHATEVER THE TERM THAT WE'RE GOING TO THE LEGISLATURE. 2. BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT PRESENCE AND DO MORE WORK. RELATED TO MAKING SURE THAT FOLKS ARE BEHAVING ON THE TRAIN. WE DO NOT SUPPORT FOLKS. SMOKING ON THE TRAIN; SMOKING MARIJUANA ON THE TRAIN. THESE ARE ALL ACTIVITIES THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE ARE BEING DIMINISHED AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE SOME FANTASTIC TRANSIT ADVOCATES ON THIS COMMITTEE WHO I TALK TO ON A REGULAR BASIS WHO CAN VOUCH THAT WE NEED TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS AND I'M IMPLORING YOU TO HELP US WORK WITH YOU IN ORDER TO MAKE AT LEAST THE FIRST FEW STEPS ON IT THEN I ALSO WANT TO SPEAK UP. BRIEFLY TO REPRESENTATIVE TORKELSON SPILL. WE ARE HAPPY TO WORK WITH REPRESENT SENATOR PARK WILSON ON THIS. WE BELIEVE YOU KNOW SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HE POINTS OUT THIS BILL AS HE MENTIONED ARE THINGS WE'RE WORKING ON ONE OF THEM IS THE ADMINISTRATIVE CITATIONS PIECE OF IT. WE WOULD LIKE TO GET ROLLING ON THAT; BUT WE ARE OPEN CLEARLY OPEN TO CONTINUING TO DO THIS. LAST THING I WILL SAY IS THERE IS A COST TO THIS AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND OPERATING ON ONE-TIME MONEY FOR A LONG TIME. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE ONGOING COMMITMENTS THAT WE DO IT WITH ONGOING FUNDING. AND SO I JUST DON'T WANT LOSE TRACK OF THE FACT THAT THIS IS IT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING ONGOING SUSTAINABLE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN AFFORD IT. BUT WITH THAT AGAIN I APPRECIATED THE COMMENTS THAT OUR PARTNERS OUR DRIVERS WERE MAKING AS WELL AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WE DO NOT TAKE THIS LIGHTLY N TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE WANT TO DO MORE BROADLY I REALLY WANT TO RESERVE THAT FOR OUR CHAIRMAN AND FOR GENERAL MANAGER SO THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME RAMBLE ON WITH THAT WE HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR AND WE UNDERSTAND THIS AND WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE THE REINS OURSELVES. THANK YOU. MISTER SHUT; NONE. CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT A CODE OF CONDUCT ON THE LIGHT RAIL.  THAT IF YOU'RE ABLE TO IT MEAN TO GET DETAILED OR ANYTHING BUT THERE IS AN ESTABLISHED ONE. I'M TOLD IS THAT RIGHT. MISTER CHAIR AND NEVER HAD BEEN I MEAN I I WOULD PREFER TO ALLOW OUR GENERAL MANAGER TO SPEAK TO THAT I I UH I KNOW THAT WE. I GUESS I SHOULD JUST LET THE THE GENERAL MANAGER SPEAK TO THAT. MISTER SHANNON 8 WE TALK IN PREVIOUS COMMITTEE HEARINGS PREVIOUS FROM METRO TRANSIT THAT THEY HAVE LIKE A 4 PERSON FOR OFFICERS THAT WERE KIND OF WORKING WITH THE HOMELESS POPULATION ON THE TRANCE AND THAT IF YOU COULD SHARE WITH A COMMISSION HERE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT A FEW REFRESH MY MIND A LITTLE BIT AND THEN TALK ABOUT HOW EFFECTIVE THAT HAS BEEN ARE GUESS IN IT NEEDS TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN IT CURRENTLY IS THAT MISTER CHAIR I THINK YOU'RE REFERRING TO ARE HOMELESS ACTION TEAM. THAT'S WHAT DOES A MADE UP OF SOME POLICE OFFICERS THAT ARE WORKING. AN ART OF ARSON OR MAKE SURE THAT THOSE UNSHELTERED HAVE A A OPPORTUNITY TO GET TO A FOLKS MAY RECALL THAT BACK IN AUGUST. WE IMPLEMENTED A FACT THAT WE'RE SHUTTING ARE TRAINED TO SEND REPORTER TRAINS DOWN MAKE SENSE FOR MAINTENANCE REASONS THAT WE ARE ABLE TO INTO SOME OF THAT WORK WHILE THE A WELL THE TRAINS ARE BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT OUR GENERAL MANAGER WEST PLACED ROW WILL BE VERY EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE WORK THAT ARE HOMELESS ACTION TEAM IS UNDERTAKING AND THAT WE ARE NOT A SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCY BUT WE ARE ALSO PART OF THE FABRIC OF THE SOCIETY AND WE REALIZE THAT TRANSIT IS A PIECE OF THAT AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW WE ARE PLAYING OUR ROLE IN IT; BUT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR PARTNERS ARE ARE YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT THEY PULLING UP THERE AND WE ARE ARE I THINK MAKING SOME REALLY GOOD HAD WE HAVE WAITED TO THAT BUT I AM DEFINITELY NOT THE SPOKESPERSON WHO CAN GO INTO THE DETAIL RELATED TO THAT SPECIFIC PROGRAM. THANK YOU REPRESENTATIVE YOU CAN.  THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JUST WANT TO THANK THEM. MISTER SHANNON FOR TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT HOMELESS ACTION TEAM. I THINK YOU'RE RUNNING INTO A LOT OF WHAT A HOLLER OTHER PUBLIC GOODS TO BETWEEN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES AND TRANSIT. FOLKS COME TO ALL THOSE TO USE HIS SERVICES WITH SOME OF THE BAGGAGE AND THE ISSUES THAT THEY'RE CARRYING WITH THEM AND WOW YOU DON'T YOU DON'T PROVIDE A SOCIAL SERVICE. YOU DO I REALIZE JUST LIKE THE REST OF US OF A LIES THAT SOMETIMES BEEN CALLED UPON TO ACTUALLY HAVE TO TRY TO PUT BAND-AIDS ON THE 7 FIX THAT PROBLEM THAT'S IN FRONT OF US ACTUALLY BUT UNTIL WE HAVE THAT BROADER CONVERSATION ABOUT STEMMING SOME OF THOSE TIDES BEFORE THEY GET INTO OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS AND FRESH AND THAT'S JUST GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAPPEN. REPRESENTATIVE RON BACK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR; AND I AND THANKS FOR YOUR COMMENTS; MISTER SHELTON AND I'M HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO GET INTO THIS A LITTLE FURTHER. I THINK THAT BIG DISCUSSION TODAY KIND OF POINTS TO SOME SERIOUS MISMANAGEMENT ISSUES AT METRO TRANSIT. I MEAN YOU KNOW IT'S A PUBLIC AGENCY IS SUPPOSED TO SERVE CUSTOMERS AND I'D JUST LIKE TO ADD A COUPLE OF OF OF HEARD ABOUT DRIVER SHORTAGE; BUT WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY ANY A MATERIAL PRESENTED MADE AVAILABLE AND HOW THAT IS GOING. THERE'S ALSO THE ISSUE OF EXCESSIVE DRIVER OVER TIME. AND I'M GONNA HAVE I'M WAITING FOR YOUR REPORT FROM LAST YEAR BUT OVER TIME AND THE AMOUNT OF $25 MILLION EVERY BIENNIUM IF WE HAVE A DRIVER SHORTAGE. WE'RE CUTTING RUNS WHICH OF COURSE WE'VE HEARD ABOUT IN THE LAST YEAR. MANY MANY BUS ROUTES ARE BEING CUT OR SHORTENED ELIMINATED. HOW DOES ALL THIS RELATE IT; I MEAN THERE IS SOMETHING GOING ON THAT WE NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT SO WHEN YOU HAVE OVER TIME OF 18% THAT'S 18% OF REGULAR PAY FOR DRIVERS AND OPERATORS IS OVER TIME. THEN IT'S BUILT IN ITS STRUCTURE ITS IT'S INTENTIONAL WE NEED TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HOW YOUR YOU KNOW TRYING TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES HOW YOU'RE TRYING TO ACTUALLY HIRE FOLKS THAT ARE GOING TO STAY AND STAY A REGULAR IN FULL-TIME DRIVER AND SOMEONE AND THERE WHAT IS THE ROLE OF A PART-TIME DRIVER. YOU HAVE PART-TIME DRIVERS BUT THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO ACTUALLY FILLING IN WHEN THERE ARE WHEN THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T COME BECAUSE OF SICKNESS. IT'S A POOL OF FOLKS AND YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT IS REALLY GOING ON AND WHY ARE WE ALLOWING SORT YOU KNOW NOBODY SEEMS TO BE IN CHARGE OF MAKING GOOD DECISIONS FROM THE TOP DOWN WE NEED TO TO KNOW I GUESS WHAT. THAT THERE ARE BETTER THINGS IN STORE FOR THE FUTURE. SO I WILL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT; BUT I MEAN I HAVE SPOKEN WITH REPRESENT HORNSTEIN ABOUT THIS I HAVE A BILL TO REQUIRE THE THE O L E TO TO DO AN AUDIT TO DO AN INVESTIGATION. WE DON'T SEE OVER TIME LIKE THAT AND OTHER AGENCIES SO I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT; BUT I HOPE WE CAN CAN TAKE UP THE THIS RELATED MATTER TO TO METRO TRANSIT. MISTER CHAIR OF THE HOMELESS AT AROUND BACK I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS TONIGHT. I DO WANT TO APOLOGIZE YOU WERE ON THIS ON THE AGENDA TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE.  THE BUS SAFETY WITH THEIR RECESS AND I JUST IT WAS MY MY CHOICE TO SKIP OVER THAT SO WE COULD GET TO SOME OF THE TEST FIRES THAT WERE HERE. WE DO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME MISTER SHOT IN THE WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND REPRESENT RUN  WE HAVE COMMUNICATED TO YOU THAT IT IS A NECESSARY FOR US TO CLOSE THE BOOKS ON OUR CALENDAR YEAR BUDGET SIMILAR LITERALLY TO WHAT WE DID LAST YEAR AND WE'VE COMMITTED TO DOING THAT SO IT HAS A IT'S JUST WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WRAP THAT UP SO WE CAN PROVIDE YOU THOSE NUMBERS AND THAT IS JUST THE COURSE THAT WE HAVE TO IN ORDER TO DO THAT. I WAS GOING TO MENTION THAT WE WERE PREPARING TO HAVE THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE BUS DRIVER. SHORTAGE AND HOW WE WERE WORKING TO RETAIN AND FOLKS IN ORDER TO DO THAT THE BROADER CONVERSATION RELATED TO MISMANAGEMENT AND HOW THINGS ARE BEING OPERATED THAT IS DEFINITELY A CONVERSATION TO HAVE EITHER WITH THE CHAIRMAN WHO WOULD LIKE TO REMIND THE FOLKS STARTED MAYBE 3; 4 WEEKS AGO; AND IN OUR GENERAL MANAGER BUT A HAPPY TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WE DON'T SHY AWAY FROM THEM; I'M ALSO GOING TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT WE NOT ONLY ARE WE AUDITED BY THE STATE AUDITOR THAT A BILL PASSED A 2 YEARS AGO OR 3 YEARS AGO THAT HAD THE LEGISLATIVE AUDITOR RESCUES ME THE AT THE LEGISLATIVE AUDITOR TO QUARTERLY AUDITS OF OUR FUNDING THAT THE LEGISLATIVE AUDITOR BROUGHT FORWARD LAST YEAR. 2. DISMISSED THAT BECAUSE THEY FOUND NO ISSUES WITH HOW THE COUNCIL DOES R R I'M NOT. SPENDING.  WE SENATOR PRATT AND REPRESENTATIVE YOU CAN HAVE. SO WE'LL GO WITH THAT AND THEN WE'LL KIND OF WRAP UP THIS DISCUSSION. MEMBERS I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT. A POLICY AREA THAT WE NEED TO HELP AND I FOR ONE AND I THINK WE NEED TO BE PARTNERS AND WILLING TO WORK WITH THE MET COUNCIL. I'M LIKE I LIKE TO SAY THEY ARE IT'S EASY TO FOR THEM TO BE A PUNCHING BAG FOR A SON AND. I THINK IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY THOUGH TOO TO TRY TO HELP WORK FOR SOLUTIONS FOR THEM. SENATOR PRATT FIRST. WELL; THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR; AND MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK OUR. YOU KNOW OUR OPERATORS FOR COMING IN AND TESTIFYING TODAY TOO. I THINK IT'S NICE TO HEAR THAT YOU HAVE PLANS. BUT THE ACTIONS AND CHANGES AS AS I HEARD TODAY ARE BEINGS SEEM BY OUR OPERATORS AND NOT YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO BEAT UP ON ON THE MET COUNCIL BUT I HAVE REALLY SERIOUS CONCERNS. THAT YOU HAVE AN OBLIGATION. TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF YOUR WRITERS AND YOUR OPERATORS AND IT'S NOT HAPPENING. I'M CONCERNED THAT REPORTS ARE BEING PERCEIVED AS AS NOT BEING ACTED UPON RIGHT IF IF THESE OPERATORS ARE ARE SUBMITTING INCIDENT REPORTS AND THERE'S NO FOLLOW-UP AND. CLEAR AT YOU HAVEN'T INDICATED THAT ANY OF THAT HAS RISEN UP TO THE EXECUTIVE LEVEL IN THE MET COUNCIL IS A CONCERN. I'M CONCERNED THAT EMPLOYEES ARE BEING THREATENED WITH THEIR JOBS WHEN THEY RAISE CONCERNS. I WOULD EXPECT THAT THE NEXT TIME WE GET TOGETHER. SOMEBODY BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT NOT JUST WHAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT DOING BECAUSE CAMERAS CAMERAS ONLY SHOW YOU WHAT'S HAPPENING. THEY DON'T ACTUALLY STOP SOMEBODY FROM DOING ANYTHING. I WOULD HOPE I WOULD EXPECT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO COME NOT ONLY WITH THE TIMELINE OF WHEN CHANGES ARE GOING TO BE MADE. BUT I WANT TO SEE AND I WANT TO SEE SOUTH AND IF NOT I KNOW WELL A LOT OF WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THIS INCIDENT REPORTS BECAUSE IT SOUNDS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH THE ELDER ABUSE REPORTS THAT WERE BEING FILED AND IGNORED BY DHS AND THE PAST AND I HATE TO SEE THAT HAPPENING HERE AND I THINK WITH THE SCRUTINY. THAT'S BEEN RAISED IN SOME OF THESE OTHER. THESE OTHER AGENCIES THAT THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO BE MADE AWARE AND I JUST I JUST FIND IT VERY CONCERNING THAT AT LEAST THE PERCEPTION FROM YOUR TESTIMONY AND FROM THE OPERATORS IS THAT. THESE CONCERNS ARE BEING IGNORED. AND NOT GETTING THE THE RIGHT LEVEL OF SCRUTINY AND I WOULD ALSO QUITE HONESTLY ENCOURAGE THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR TO GO IN AND START LOOKING AT THESE SAFETY CONCERNS AS WELL. MISTER CHAPMAN BRIEFLY UP OR OTHERWISE WE'LL MOVE ON TO A PRE SHE YOU'RE NOT MEANT I WILL CERTAINLY. SEE WHAT'S GOING ON TONIGHT WILL BE SEEN. YOU KNOW A LOT OF ALL OF YOU HERE IN ABOUT A WEEK WE'LL MAKE SURE WE WE CIRCLE BACK ON THAT I WILL ALSO SAY THAT YOU KNOW SOME THINGS THAT WE ARE DOING I JUST WANT TO REITERATE. WE NEED THE LEGISLATURE'S HELP IN ORDER TO DO THIS AND SO SOME WE LIKE IT THAT ARE NOT COMING BACK WITH THE WITH THE FULL EQUATION OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO BUT A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WE CAN'T DO WITHOUT YOUR SYSTEM. REPRESENTED THE WE HAVE A ROUGHLY ABOUT 4 MINUTES AND WE WANT TO BE VERY QUICK WITH TEAR GAS TO KILL I THANK YOU FOR A MENTION THAT WE HAVE TO COME TO THE TABLE TO FIND SOLUTIONS AND.  NOT NECESSARILY DEMONIZE ACTUALLY THE MODE OF TRANSIT TO I THINK SOMETIMES GET SHORT SHRIFT WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT THOSE RIDERS IN THAT MODE OF TRANSIT AND THAT IT'S THAT MODE OF TRANSITS PROBLEM FOR SOMETHING A WHOLE SOCIETIES CREATED SO I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT COMING TOGETHER FOR THAT ONE QUICK QUESTION FOR MISTER 7. I'M AGAIN WHAT YOU'RE STARTING DRIVERS. HOURLY RATE. I'M SURE JUST WHAT THEY MOST WANT TO END UP FRONT. I WAS LIKE 1750. FOR THE RECORD MISTER CHAIR REPRESENT YOUR TEAM IS $20.44.  THANK MISTER SHARON AND MISTER CHAIR. I YOU'RE FACING SOME OF THE SAME THINGS AS SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE FACING AND I'VE HEARD THIS AND OUR COMMITTEE AS WELL. THERE IS A SHORT OF THE DRIVERS EVERYWHERE. SOME OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE ABLE TO GO ABOVE CLASS BECAUSE WE SUBSIDIZE THEM FRANKLY A LOT MORE THAN WE SET TO TASTE MET COUNCIL; UNABLE TO DRIVE PAY THEIR DRIVERS MORE SO NOT ONLY ARE YOU WORKING IN A TIGHT MARKET YOU'RE COMPETING AGAINST OTHER PUBLIC ENTITIES THAT ARE ABLE TO HIRE DRIVERS SO I WANT TO ALSO KEEP THAT IN MIND WITH THE DRIVER SHORT IS IT'S NOT JUST MET COUNCIL; THIS IS EVERYWHERE.  WE'RE JUST TO ADD ON THAT ROAD REAL QUICKLY; I'M JUST BECAUSE WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME TODAY; I'M GOING TO E-MAIL THE PRESENTATION THAT WE HAVE PREPARED TO GO THROUGH RELATED TO THE YOU KNOW SHORTFALL AND THEN I'M HAPPY TO CATCH UP WITH PEOPLE NEXT THE GOING TO SHOOT ME AN E-MAIL BACK WE CAN HAVE THAT CONVERSATION MISTER FUNK FROM A METRO TRANSIT WHO OVERSEAS THAT IS HERE AND WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO COME VISIT WITH YOU OR ANY OF THE COMMITTEES TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AS WELL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAPMAN.  AND THEN MEMBERS ITEM NUMBER 7 OTHER BUSINESSES DETERMINED BY THE CHAIR I WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO THEM; PUBLIC AND THOSE THEY HAD TO WAIT EARLIER TODAY. I IT NOT NECESSARY. AND IT'S NO SURPRISE THE HAPPENS HERE AT THE CAPITOL PETITION COME OUT THE WAY IT DID THE DAY. SO I APOLOGIZE AND THANK YOU FOR WAITING IN YOUR PATIENTS. I THINK IT WAS AN IMPORTANT DISCUSSION THAT WE HAD TODAY. I WAS HONORED TO BE THE CHAIR FOR TODAY'S MEETING AND HAVE BEEN DULY ELECTED. I DIDN'T THE MANNER IN ANOTHER OUT OF. ORDER MOTION WAS WAS MADE.
