 he took the ones in the middle, KSh 6,000 then he went to the river with a basin and clothes to wash what I didn't know is he was actually travelling to Nairobi my son was in Nairobi, he leaves the house and when he comes back he is putting on some big hats he says he was coming from Machakos where they had been acting I asked what sort of acting, and I was told he had joined a group of some comedians that is the time he went underground in my mind I used to perceive comedy as something done by at times hunger is very stupid, it goes to a place like Kayole to attack someone when it knows really there is nothing there Bro, don't you know when you have no money you need to sleep hungry? Mzee thank you so much let me help you carry the kid he would be like, dad you haven't done anything for me   he said dad I am done with High school, when I join the University I will get other stuffs he told me he left the stuffs he was using in high school there including the mattress he came with nothing saying that if he goes to the university he will be needing new stuffs I had not accepted that fully but I was sort of wondering why he was doing such things yet he had already turned 18 we need to pick your stuffs that you left in school the next morning he told me he had already sent someone for the items he had actually given those items to the brother of one of his friends who was joining Form 1 The boy said Othuol gave me these stuffs because I am joing school bext year I told the boy if he had given you those items in good faith like that then it's okay you can use them my son was in Nairobi, he leaves the house and when he comes back he is putting on some big hats he says he was coming from Machakos where they had been acting I asked what sort of acting, and I was told he had joined a group of some comedians that is the time he went underground   I used to perceive comedy as something done by he took the ones in the middle, KSh 6,000 then he went to the river with a basin and clothes like someone who was going to wash what I didn't know is he was actually travelling to Nairobi I waited for the entire day and someone told me he had seen his clothes and a basin by the river I sent a child to go and collect them, I waited patiently for him to return only to be told he was already in Nairobi after how long? I said no, I want nothing to do with him and let him do his own things but what I just need from him is for him to join the University that was all they had seen him, I wasn't bothered anyway I just said he is among those who have refused to work so let him remain in Nairobi that is where Othuol Othuol lives that is Othuol's father let me hide and have some fun and suddenly someone is like that is Othuol's dad he would tell them, sit close to my dad, if he says you are a good girl then it is you I will marry  I used to tell him, I didn't know their character but he should settle down with the one he felt comfortable with Othuol was looking healthy and it's like that lady was the one taking care of him Othuol had found a good lady so the lady gave me her dad's number and we started talking   they live together take some maize and give to him or maybe take this cash to him who told me Mzee don't worry we are here and that is our brother dad the little I had yesterday is what I used and I would ask why don't you save for tomorrow also? why spend everything today? but he would say dad we shall still get some more dad I can't take it any more actually she came out frankly and told me dad I can't handle your son any longer he has gone back to drinking and I think I can't take it any longer I asked her to come home but she said no because she had not lived with him for that long even though she wanted to settle down with him I called Othuol and asked him if I should travel to Nairobi so that we could talk to the lady but he said no that is my life please don't meddle in it and the lady has her life too he told me not to meddle in his personal life I told him it's okay, so the lady left and I never heard form her again and Othuol too decided to live a private life so that is when he started going on and off I have not heard of any yet he had one he just appeared home although he had not told me he was coming told me he will be at home for a week, he has finally decided to put up a house because it was the main reason why both of us were not in terms he did not have a place to get money he finally built a house let mine be a little bit bigger then I will built you a more bigger one in the near future his house is I told him you can't leave without spending a night in your house I used to drink a lot, selling basically everything just to buy alcohol, phone, tv, even cooking gas like you would give someone your cooking gas in exchange for money? Yes, I would receive like KSh 3,000 which I use to buy liquor let people eat iron sheets stop drinking
