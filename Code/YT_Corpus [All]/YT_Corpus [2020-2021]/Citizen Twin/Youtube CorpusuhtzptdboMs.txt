are concerned about what   kind of world will they be able to raise their  children in is their hope and how can we face   the future Jesus gives a marvelous promise john 14  let not your heart be troubled i will come again   Jesus asked do you have a troubled heart? do  you have an anxious heart? are you stressed? out   our great hope is the second coming of Jesus can  we be sure that Jesus is coming for the second   time we don't have to guess friends the answer  is yes scripture promises that Christ will appear   a second time Jesus testified that  he will come back to this earth again   Jesus fulfilled all the messianic prophecies  of his first coming and we can believe   that he will also fulfill the  prophecies concerning his second coming   here are seven events that describe Christ's  return event number one Jesus will return to   this earth in the same manner he left there are  some Christians who believe that Christ is coming   will be a spiritual event but the bible teaches  that the coming of Christ will be a literal event   here the bible describes how Jesus ascended to  heaven it says this same Jesus who was taken up   from you into heaven will so come in like manner  as you saw him go into heaven was that a real   Jesus that the disciples saw go up or was that  some kind of spiritual presence that was a real   Jesus that went up Jesus ascended to the sky and  he will return in the sky event number two every   eye will see Jesus return and how many eyes will  see Christ when he comes back in glory revelation   1 verse 7 says every i will see him every  living person will see Jesus when he comes back   i believe that even the eyes of the blind will be  open to see that event every man,woman and child   living in the world will see Jesus at his coming  he was visible when he left and he will be visible   when he comes again event number three it will be  the loudest event in mankind for ask the lightning   coming out of the east and shine it even unto the  west so shall also the coming of the son of man be   psalm 50 verse 3 says our god shall come  and shall not keep silence every ear   will hear this trembling sound every angel  will be blowing the trumpet come with me to the   noisiest texts in the bible for the lord himself  shall descend from heaven with a shout with the   voice of the archangel and with the trumpet  god and the dead in Christ shall rise first   no one will accidentally miss it or be able  to read about it in the newspaper the next day   everyone everywhere will hear it the lord shouts  with the trumpet blast it will not be a secret   coming event number four his coming will open the  graves people that had given their life to christ   and lived a life of obedience to him  will only experience a temporary death   friends believers don't die they just go  to sleep waiting for the resurrection that   everyone which sees the son and believe it on him  may have everlasting life and i will raise him up   at the last day do you have loved ones that have  passed away my wife lost her mother to an aneurysm   when she was only 13 years old and we look  forward to meeting her in the resurrection day   when Jesus returns there would be a grand reunion  the words of Jesus are clear the dead believers   will be raised the dead in Christ will rise  by his power and will meet him in the air   by Christ's resurrection power he will reward  the righteous with an immortal body afterward   the faithful who are still alive will also be  caught up we shall all be changed in a moment   in a twinkling of an eye this mortal  must put on immortality the feet of Jesus   will not touch the ground but rather it is  the righteous that will meet him in the air   event number five his coming will destroy the  earth the earth is utterly broken down the earth   is clean dissolved the earth is moved exceedingly  and it shall fall and not rise again imagine   an earthquake that levels the mountains and sinks  the islands it will truly be a day of destruction   for those who are not ready for Jesus's coming and  there were voices and thunders and lightnings and   there was a great earthquake such as was not since  men were upon the earth so mighty and earthquake   and so great it will truly be a climactic event  this world will be uninhabitable by people   after Christ comes his coming will shake the very  foundations of the earth revelation 6 14-17 which   tells us that the wicked will run to the rocks and  mountains and pray that they fall on them and hide   them from the face of Jesus you see friends sin  cannot exist in the presence of a holy god either   you will be running to the rocks and mountains or  you will be ascending into the air to meet Jesus   behold this is our god we have waited for him  and he will save us event number six the majority   will be deceived for 6 000 years Satan and his  angels have been mastering the art of deceiving   mankind and he will try to duplicate Christ's  return and many will be deceived our only safety   is knowing and following the truth of god's word  Satan has introduced a tremendous false teaching   of the secret rapture to the Christian world the  secret rapture theory relies primarily on texts   that speak of the lord coming like a thief in the  night second peter 3 10 says but the day of the   lord will come as a thief in the night secret  rapture theory teaches that this verse implies   that Christ will come secretly to steal away the  righteous and carry them quietly to heaven but the   true message of this verse is that Jesus will come  like a thief in the sense that the coming will be   a great surprise to those who aren't ready it will  catch them off guard god's word is simply telling   us that the coming of the lord will be a thief in  timing not in manner another verse used to support   the secret rapture is Luke 17 34 i tell you in  that night there shall be two men in one bed the   one shall be taken and the other shall be left  in Luke 17 34-36 Jesus uses biblical symbolism   to prove a simple point and that point is there  will only be two groups before Jesus returns   ones that are saved and ones that are lost  what about the bed a bed implies sleep and it   represents death our friend Lazarus sleeping  but i go that i may awake him out of sleep   then said Jesus unto them plainly Lazarus is dead  in the last days there will be two kinds of people   sleeping in the grave ones that are saved and  lost another misinterpretation by the secret   rapture theory is that it teaches that people  will continue to live on earth for seven more   years after Christ's return when Jesus returns no  one will be left alive the scriptures say clearly   and the slain of the lord shall be at that day  from one end of the earth even unto the other end   of the earth they shall not be lamented neither  gathered nor buried they shall be done upon   the ground the state of the earth will be  desolate life on earth does not continue   after Jesus comes event number seven Jesus rewards  the faithful revelation 22 verse 12 says behold i   am coming quickly and my reward is with me the  second coming of Jesus will mean final judgment   when Christ comes the destiny of each person is  decided whether for eternal life or eternal loss   Jesus will give us the crown of life  having glorified bodies like Christ   we will be one day citizens of heaven and spent  eternity with Jesus would you like to see Jesus   face to face and thank him for giving his life  for us friend you can
