 good afternoon good afternoon and to everyone at home we begin with a question from Tom Mooney Colonel Callahan of the National Guard mentioned yesterday Friday establishing potentially 2,000 field hospital beds do you foresee using that many I do I do and I want to make a point about that we could it's impossible today to predict exactly how many we need our mission is to prepare for the worst and work for the best but I want you to think about this in the past week we've more than doubled our rate of hospitalizations so word that to continue you could imagine very quickly going from 97 to 2000 or more now it would I'm not saying we will although we have models that suggest it might get even quite a bit higher than that so I'm mentioning this for two reasons one for those folks who still aren't serious in the way they are interpreting the stay at home order this isn't a joke there will be thousands of people in the hospital in Rhode Island with coronavirus and the months to come whether that number is 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 6,000 it depends on whether the people of Rhode Island continue to obey the social distancing rules staying home if they're sick washing their hands etc the other point I do want to make is I don't want people to be surprised so this is this will happen there's no scenario in which in which a week from now we don't have many many more cases to report so you I don't want you shouldn't be surprised many many more people will be sick very sadly many more people will die and our hospitals will be overwhelmed that's what we know will happen but what I also know will happen is if we continue to meet the challenge of virus with the same level of sophistication and a comprehensive approach and aggressiveness and this 24-hour constant response is going to be much much much better than it would have been and that's what I'm trying to do now I'm just trying to protect as protect everyone as much as possible from the from the downside that is coming our way all balanced against my great desire to get people back to work so this is kind of a Rubik's Cube of public policy that we're trying to do here every time you change one thing everything else changes and we're just trying to keep it all together in balance guided by data facts willingness to be flexible listening to experts and focused on everyone's safety our next question is from bill Bartholomew governor have you considered waiving the typical fees and procedural standards for retired health care professionals that may want to step up and return to the workforce the answer is yes in fact on my to-do list this weekend is to go through a variety of executive orders related to a number of different regulatory changes that are going to have to be made wherever possible right now I am trying to get rid of any kind of bureaucratic red tape to make to move things along we need to be moving fast although obviously keeping in mind that we can't waive everything because we have to keep everybody safe so short answer is yes also I'll take this as an opportunity to once again implore everybody in Rhode Island if you are a health care professional of any kind and you're not fully employed and you're willing to do more please let us know RI responds org if you're retired please consider serving there will be compensation for some of you and we need the help like you just asked about the field hospital it's one thing to find 2,000 hospital beds it's another thing to find the staff just mm so I need you to answer this call Steve all quests of uprise are I asked parks beaches and recreation centers are closed golf courses remain open some on social media say this is a class issue that rich people golf your thoughts so it's a good question and I'm gonna continue to look at golf courses at this point you taxi and uber companies do not want to go to the test sites Thank You Toni it's a terrific question we are working really hard on coming up with the solution and I hope that by tomorrow or the next day I have a more complete answer we are working with RIPTA to make you know more public transportation available to the test sites also working with the transportation providers who do business with Medicaid so hang in there just a bit more we're on it in the meantime I would say you know reach out to 2 1 1 because we are social service agencies are providing rides you can call your local legislator I know a lot of the local legislators have said to me that they're helping their constituents with food delivery and rides so if you could just get through the next couple of days relying on friends family in the United Way I hope to have a more comprehensive response in a day or two Kate Nagle is noticing Governor that you're not wearing a facemask pace covering are you wearing one in public is your staff wearing face coverings how about Statehouse employees yes so we are in fact I'm smiling because I thought about coming out here in a face covering but realized it would be very difficult to deliver a press conference but the answer is absolutely you know last night my husband my kids and I we sat down and we all got together our face coverings and I absolutely plan on wearing them as does my staff as says dr. Nicole Alexander Scott so by the way and I'm following all the rules I have to come to work so I do but you know when we go to the grocery store I go alone I take one person I stay far away from folks washing my hands constantly nobody's above the rules in this one including myself and also on the face coverings we we were reluctant I'll be very honest we were reluctant to give that guidance for a while because we don't want people to think that that's a magic bullet because it isn't it might help a little it might help somewhat it might help for you to prevent giving somebody else the virus if you have it but social distancing staying home if you're sick washing your hands constantly are every bit as important if not more important and he and if you are sick at all slight fever headache tired sniffles do not think you can put your face your a cloth mask on and go outside you still need to be staying home next question from Cathy Greig of the Providence Journal how many ICU beds in Rhode Island now how many are occupied when are new beds arriving and are we paying the convention center to use it as a field hospital so there are 180 total ICU beds roughly that are actively available about 47 of them are vacant the rest are occupied based on what the governor shared yesterday there is work being done with certain localities to be able to stand them up the Convention Center being one of them to set up as a hospital I know we're learning it's more than just a field hospital from general Callahan but we're looking to make sure it has the services that are needed and to finish the question are we paying the convention center to use it as a field hospital so yes we are paying the convention center along with the other two temporary sites we've been grateful for the participation of the Quonset Development Corporation which is a part of the Loews site the landlord for the citizens facility and the Convention Center Authority so that we're paying a nominal fee so that we can have control of the site and have appropriate legal protections and have been negotiating leases with both the three sites along with all the relevant and associated vendors and fully expect that those funds will be reimbursed through the federal stimulus governor next question is from John DiPietro when did you learn the Patriots plane would deliver a hundred thousand mass to Rhode Island does the state need masks you had said the state was receiving five to seven million where are they coming from yeah so since every day runs into the next it was about a week ago I talked to Governor Baker and the folks at at the Patriots and arranged for us to receive a hundred thousand of those masks we absolutely need more masks we have about five million or so on order and they're coming from all over the place the truth of it is I'm taking them from wherever I can get them many are coming direct from China some were working with manufacturers directly here in the states some of them through FEMA so it's we have a broad supply chain that we're building and managing and if you have a credible lead you should let us now where we're chasing down every lead that we can because like I've said before it's a global fight I'm in the fight every day with every other state many of the countries and will we need quality masks we're not taking anything we have a very rigorous system to check and make sure that everything is up to standards so that our healthcare providers are safe but if anyone has a credible lead we will chase it down and I'd love to hear from you Ryan bail more of what's up Newports ass many of our readers are looking for a sign of hope what statistics or information should Rhode Islanders be looking at for hope to know we are all going to get through this is there any good data perhaps number recovered that you and the Rhode Island Department of Health can share today so I'll answer that and then I'd like Nicole to answer it as well it is very hopeful that now we can test over a thousand people a day you know two weeks ago it wasn't at all clear that we'd be able to do that we at that time we're testing a few hundred people a day the fact that we have done that so quickly should give you huge hope and confidence that we are that much closer to setting up a system where we can get back to life as normal or new normal and keep everybody safe it should give you great hope actually to know that we have had hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of retired doctors and nurses offering to volunteer so that in the event if you do get sick or you need to go to the hospital we're gonna we got you covered we have a plan to have you covered it's also very hopeful that most young people and healthy people do just fine if they get the virus so you know breathe a sigh of relief around that and they are recovering and finally it's very hopeful to know that all the things we're asking you to do washing your hands staying home if you're sick etc really do work so it's there's a lot of hope I am a hundred percent confident someday soon things will be you know more normal it's not going to be the way it was but we're on a path we have a plan we're on a path or in touch with how bad it'll be but we we also are prepared and when I say we're gonna take care of you I mean it it's not it's not optimism based on nothing it's optimism based on a clear-eyed view of the facts and reality so the governor did great at covering the majority of the data points that we are looking at daily and that we can share including the number recovered that we're continuing to estimate I also want to emphasize what you can do in terms of positive data points for the people around you looking at those around you who are following the stay at home order how many times are you able to help increase that number and confirming that people are staying at home how many times are you seeing someone going to the grocery store four to three or four households so that only one person is leaving the house how many times are you seeing people make phone call to those who are seniors or those with differing abilities who have to stay at home those are also daily numbers that you can follow and keep track of for yourselves and for the people around you because every element of those numbers count in helping us overall as a state have the response that we will have and then ultimately we'll look forward to being able to share how many people we have been able to contact and to trace their contacts and help them be able to quarantine and stay at home the way we need to based on the number of cases as we're increasing those who are tested or engaging with those who have symptoms so don't underestimate the importance of what the governor has asked before everyday writing down who you have been in contact with so that if you get called you're already ready with a daily list of all of the people that you have contacted so we can accelerate our ability to do the contact tracing and really be pinpointed in our response in this epidemic governor the next question is from Tara grant hen of WP ro radio since President Trump's announcement are there any companies making mass locally can we form a coalition or drive yeah thank you we do have some companies making what I would call a more simple mask we don't have any of them making the n95 respirators but we have a few making masks I think we have one making gowns and we're in touch with companies every day it's it is it's not as simple as it sounds they have to get the specs they have to make sure they can get the right material they have to retool the manufacturing operation but the manufacturers have been phenomenal phenomenally cooperative and you know it's something we're working on every day our last question for today's briefing is from Ron st. Pierre of WH JJ radio Vermont has ordered big-box stores like Walmart and Target to stop selling non-essential items like toys and clothing telling them to sell only a sin like food beverage and medicine to cut down on the store traffic would you consider a similar order in Rhode Island yeah I wasn't aware of that so I'm gonna have to look into it as I've said so many times I'm interested in outcomes here so if I will I will check that out and if they're getting good outcomes which is to say many fewer people are visiting the store than it is something that I would consider right now we have we have pretty good compliance what I have done here is we've said we've put a strict limit on the number of people who can be in a store and anytime and we are enforcing that limit and we are we have asked the employers the big-box companies to impose social distancing mechanisms you know tape on the floor and whatnot and they are doing a good job of it this is back to my balance I'm I'm trying not to totally destroy our economy and so I'll look at it it's a it's I'll make a fact-based decision I would ask employers big-box companies big grocery stores to look around and see what else you could be doing to limit the number of people in an aisle at one time for example what is being done in some places and some other countries is only allowing traffic in an aisle to go in one direction those are the sorts of things that I I need grocery stores and big-box retailers to continue to think and innovate because our ability my ability to keep the store open depends on your willingness and ability to be creative around how you continue to keep people far enough apart when they're shopping Thank You governor thank you have a good day
