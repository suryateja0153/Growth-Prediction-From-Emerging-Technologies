 so [Music] hello and welcome to the chicago humanities festival and today's program what's next democracy my name is david oxtoby president of the american academy of arts and sciences the american academy was founded in 1780 by john adams and other patriot scholars to be a resource for the new nation the academy is in part a membership organization that honors accomplished leaders in academia business politics journalism and the arts we are also an independent non-partisan policy research center be dedicated according to our founders vision for addressing the most pressing questions facing the united states and the world the academy brings together the best minds from both inside and outside our membership to develop practical well-thought-out solutions and to affect positive change it is in that spirit that the academy launched the commission on the practice of democratic citizenship in 2018 in response to the mounting crisis facing american democracy we recognized that there are deep problems not just in the function of our political institutions but in our civic culture in american's ability to find common ground more than ever we realize that these times demand unity bipartisan solutions and most of all action that will make democracy resilient for generations to come in june commission co-chaired by danielle allen stephen heintz and eric liu released its report our common purpose reinventing american democracy for the 21st century a collection of 31 recommendations for achieving a more empowered citizenry a more responsive and effective government a more resilient civic culture and a renewed sense of commitment to democracy and each other recommendations range from increasing the size of the house of representatives to attacks on social media through expanding opportunities for national service over the past few months our democracy's vulnerabilities have been exposed by the pandemic including the danger of unresponsive government institutions the need for americans to unite for the common good the weakness of voting systems the reality of a disruptive media environment and the continuous debate about facts the life and death consequences of persistent structural inequalities demonstrate in no uncertain terms that the challenges of the 21st century pose an urgent threat to the nation and its people this is a moment of great crisis but also of opportunity we're excited to partner with the chicago humanities festival and share some of the ideas of the report with you today events like this are a key part of our report rollout as we

peterson in conversation with carrie l davis good evening and thank you so much for joining us for this evening chicago humanities festival program what's next democracy this is part of the what's next series and personally i can't think of a more timely topic than the events of the last few weeks than thinking about what the future of our democracy looks like as was noted in the introduction earlier this year the american academy of arts and sciences published a report and recommendations produced by its commission on the practice of debt of democratic citizenship that report is called our common purpose reinventing american democracy for the 21st century this evening we're delighted to be joined by three of the report's authors to discuss a path forward from this spot moment in american democracy eric lew co-chaired the commission on the practice of democratic citizenship that produced the reported recommendations he's the co-founder and ceo of citizen university and directs the aspen institute's citizenship and american identity program next we have pete peterson who's also a member of the commission and a contributor to the report he is the dean brown family dean's chair and senior fellow of the davenport institute for public engagement at pepperdine school of public policy and harry han who is also a member of the commission and a contributor to the report she's the inaugural director of the snf agora institute a professor of political science and faculty director of the p3 research lab at johns hopkins university and i must say that this is merely a short list of their many accomplishments and please check out their bio to read more of their work and and and connect with them they really are just an accomplished group and delighted to join them for discussion tonight i wanted to start just by noticing the moment that we're in right now this is a unique moment in american democracy um on the one hand our nation is struggling with deep political polarization and contested elections yet on the other hand we had record voter turnout across the country breaking records that have been in place for the last century in many states and there has been a remarkable effort by state and local governments to try to adapt democratic processes to function effectively given the challenges of pandemic it really is an interesting juxtaposition of challenges and the pros and cons that this year has brought us and my first question to all three of you is what does this moment in time tell us about the current state of our democracy um i'll dive in first uh first of all thanks so much kerry for welcoming us and to the chicago humanities festival for having this discussion we're so excited just to share some of the work that we've gotten to do three of us and 32 other commissioners who spent the better part of the last couple of three years working on this um report and now pivoting pretty hard to uh implementing the recommendations that we put in here um and i would say kerry you know someone who works on these issues from philanthropy as you do in the joyce foundation um you just named you know the good the bad and the ugly of this moment and i think that's kind of the uh that's kind of the raw material of the report itself we live in a moment right now where the good the bad and the ugly are all coming to the surface are all visible or all palpable that there is a sense of real empowerment across the board people who have long long checked out of political and civic life deciding to show up deciding to get activated us and and and they showed up uh voting uh for both parties and for different kinds of candidates in different parts of the country um the bad of course is um the ways in which our media and information environment are feeding a kind of toxic polarization and a detachment from fact that uh that our colleague david oxtoby mentioned in the introduction and the ugly well you know i don't think i need to belabor the ugly the ugly is all around us right now still um in civic life and um and i think um the great thing about having all those things brought to the surface is that we get to face them like grown-ups now i think we get to strip away any pretense or denial the democracy uh that our system of constitutional self-government is either all good or all bad uh and that we have to face and reckon with the both the promise of our creed and our high ideals uh and the great gap that exists between those promises and the actual conditions of our institutions the actual practice of citizenship on the ground and so you know living in this time through a pandemic during this age of incredible awakening around racial injustice um i think uh you know it's a net good thing uh that we have to uh face ourselves uh and and face what's broken in ourselves and in our system right now and i think that's the spirit with which we all came to this work and with which we wrote this report yeah oh go ahead oh i i was just actually going to invite you harry to join in next sure tells us about democracy um well let me just start by sort of echoing eric to say that i too am really grateful to have the opportunity to be a part of this conversation and i'm carrying the humanities festival really grateful for you all for hosting the conversation and um you know it's no surprise that i i should start just by saying that i echo everything that eric says after working with him for a couple of years on this report that i find myself often in heated agreement um with eric um which i guess is a good thing um but yeah i'll i'll add a couple thoughts um that really i think build on what he said um you know so i'm i'm a political scientist by training and one of the reasons i became a political scientist is i remember in college um you know in a class where we had to reread the federalist papers and you know reading federalist 52 where he writes about you know what is government but the greatest of all reflections of humankind if men at the time if men were angels no government would be necessary and i remember sitting there thinking wow like our government is a reflection of who we are as a people and what does that mean and i think that's what really that impulse is really what called me into doing this work um trying to understand how democracy and our political system works and i think that i find myself in this moment and um you know kind of reflecting on the trends carry that you laid out really going back and thinking about that quote from the federalist papers right what is government or if we were to broaden that what is our democratic system but the greatest of all reflections of who we are and if we were all angels no government would be necessary and i see that i think that you see those competing trends emerging in our politics right now that you know citizens aren't born they are made and and if we are if people are not put into settings where they invited to be their better selves to find common purpose to do the hard work of developing the muscles of democracy and making that possible then you know sometimes our not so good angels can come out and you know and i think that we that's where we see the good the bad and the ugly coming together um and part of what i really appreciated about working on this commission is the way in which i feel like as a commission we really sort of thought about the about democracy as being a set of interlocking systems right and so when we think about how we sort of create the settings where people are called and invited to find their better angels it's not just thinking about at the level of the constitution and congress and the big you know capital i institutions of government although those are really important and a part of what we talk about but it's also thinking about the ways and the places in which we are invited together with each other um in our digital communities and geographic communities that we inhabit in all the settings you know that we're a part of and trying to think about how do we strengthen the kinds of settings that people are invited into and the ways in which they help lay the foundation for people to develop those muscles of democracy you know to sort of learn the capacities to develop this sense of citizenship um that we can all work together towards and i think um you know as i as i sort of think about the the juxtaposition of these positive and negative trends that you described in in the question it's it feels like we're seeing both of those things come out you know when people are put in settings where they can um act towards the common good than they do in a lot of settings but then when in places where we starve those institutions or those institutions need to be reformed then you know we see the effects of that also um so you know i am you know one last thing i'll say before i i um you know turn it over is just to sort of say that you know i grew up as a child of immigrants and i think that very much informs the way that i think about these things and one of the things that i always learn from that experience is that transformation is not only possible it's sort of what we do as humans and and so i think that it's it's that promise of transformation that is at the audacious hope at the heart of democracy but also um you know part of i think what we need to confront and face right now yeah i'll just jump in and say i had a radio interview this morning about the election with the local pbs station and it and it forced me to go back to pull out a book that we teach here at the policy school uh the the great essayist of the 20th century walter littman wrote a book called public opinion and he has a chapter in there called yes and no and the criticism that he's making about democratic practices is that oftentimes when we get to the election stage it's only an up-down vote right and what's missing from that is or what can what can be conveyed in that is that with a yes or no answer on a political candidate or a ballot measure that there's obviously a manichaean choice there and the results will be seen in manichaean ways but we are not as human beings really that divided right there can be a myriad of reasons why one person would vote one way or another way on an issue but when you look at results of any political election it can be very easy to say well half of the country thinks this and half of the country thinks that and what lipman begs us to do is actually to take it a step further and say are we really separated in that way of course elections are extremely important but they're they're really not the best way of getting engaging or or gauging our civic culture and i think what's so great about this report to go back to our common purpose is that one as eric said you know it started off with these 35 commissioners it was all re was also discussed by 50-plus focus groups that we hosted around the country very politically diverse uh and diverse in a myriad of other different ways geographically household income educational background and so forth but in that process we were still able to come to a set of conclusions here uh 30 plus conclusions which were not the least common denominators that you would often see come out of multi-partisan conversations these these proposals which i'm sure we'll get into here really have an edge to them and i think it's it's worth talking about the fact that we can have our common purpose coming out of very multi-partisan discussions which can sometimes be lost when we just look at election results [Music] thanks pete that's actually a really comforting thought um i imagine all of us have been involved in conversations where people are focused on the the extremes in society and the divisions and and it really is wonderful and that's one of the things i liked about the title of the report is that there there is this threat of unity that we can all rally around and and so many ways that's that's also the history of our democracy so i i'm thrilled uh next we want to really dive into you know some of the needs of the report if you know civilians will pardon the term of the meat of the report um i also want to make sure that we're inviting our audience to participate as well um you have a q a option please send us your questions we'd love to really invite you to engage with our panelists especially as we're thinking about this incredibly important topic about what's next for our american democracy um with that i want to start diving into the report and you all sort of mentioned this already in your initial remarks but let's kind of take a step back so we we just talked about the moment we're in um and and the pros and cons the good bad and the ugly at this moment but your work as commissioners started well before this year and i'm kind of curious i'm curious to hear and i imagine our audiences as well what prompted the academy to start looking into this a year or two ago and having these focus groups and really exploring this issue for what our american democracy should look like going forward eric would you like to kick us off sure you know i think um in the same vein that we've been talking about this two simultaneous realities prompted the academy to undertake this project one is of course that americans across the board are losing faith in democracy losing trust in government and our institutions and losing and trust in each other and that is epidemic and it was epidemic even before the epidemic the pandemic arrived but the other reality that also prompted us is that um if you focus your gaze away from washington dc um and start looking at communities around the country um you actually see and and this is the nature of the work we do at citizen university working with catalysts from communities red and blue rural small towns big cities all across the board you actually see a democratic renewal a renaissance a civic awakening underway um and uh to put it in the language of one of our other fellow commissioners you've all lived in um you see this cascade of responsibility taking uh across the board in a lot of places that um a media narrative might say oh that's a broken place that's a broken place in appalachia that's a broken place in east l.a that's a broken place on the west side of chicago right no no no no look a little closer and you see people taking responsibility trying to figure out how not only to solve problems but to create a shared story about what we're trying to do here and what we're part of right and so sensing both these things at the same time and just given the history of the academy the whole point of the american academy going back to john adams and those other scholar patriots was to ensure that particularly in times of crisis in times of um gestation and new birthing and and painful transformation like the country is going through now um that we'd be able to um have a place and a way uh to step back a little bit and listen for those deeper patterns look for those deeper uh listen for those deeper frequencies and look for deeper patterns in what's going on and um and that was the spirit with which we launched this endeavor and i think um you know pete mentioned um in addition to the fact that we had 35 you know commissioners from all walks and all parts of the country those 50 plus listening sessions that we did around the united states um that was not window dressing that formed not only the content of this report but it formed the kind of mindset that we came into it i think it actually made us take a higher sense of responsibility that okay we need to we need to actually figure out how to come to consensus on some of this stuff we need to figure out how to put some proposals here that are going to be responsive to folks because what we heard from folks is that number one people across the board think so much in our politics is broken and number two they want to fix it they don't know how they don't always have the language or the tools or the literacy and power uh to be able to affect that change immediately but that yearning is strong right and i love what pete you were saying uh you know quoting walter littman about the the false binaries and the kind of misimpression of a manichaean choice that that certainly elections can give us but also just a binary narrative in general can give us and i think what we found is that people around the country either are busting that binary or just kind of orthogonal to it all together they're just trying to make something work in a community and um and yes national politics keeps on butting its way in and giving people cues about how to behave and what to say and whether or not to wear a mask and so forth but but still on a base level there is both common sense and a yearning for common purpose and and the academy felt like it was our responsibility to uh dive into that to plumb those depths and to kind of report back not only what we heard but ideas then for how we can uh reinvent our democracy to be responsive to all of that yearning and all of that hope out there how are you anything you want to add i'll just sort of add that i think um to the point of you know the fact that this report this commission started several years ago is um you know a lot of the trends that we're seeing surface after the election right now are really a symptom of you know much larger sets of issues that were that were there and so the the conversation as eric described i think was trying to get at well what are the underlying issues um that uh that are permeating our political culture and our political life and and what are the the deep fixes that we can do that would transcend any one particular moment um that we might have in our in in democracy and so um in that sense you know i think that um you know i was really um i i too found the listening sessions to be really important because i think ms erickson what we saw was just this hunger that people had um to find ways to be able to act to improve the world around them and it's not that and people might come at it from different perspectives and i don't you know we don't want to paper over that um but that people i think did have this sense that what we have isn't working like what else is out there and i think um being able to engage in that conversation in a serious and and deep way um in a multifaceted way was was really important i'll just add just on the process note i i wouldn't want uh our viewers here to think that this was just some kumbaya moment over over two years as we talked through these proposals or even in the listening sessions themselves we started with well over a hundred recommendations and it went through a process of of deliberation disagreement argument at points um all well-intentioned and civil but at the same time i i think what i'm so proud of as a member of the commission is in looking at the the final set of 30-plus proposals that this went through a real deliberative multi-partisan process that is grounded in the american experience which again through these listening sessions around the country i think uh very much much supported both the head and heart of uh of this report the report really explores a lot of different avenues for reimagining and strengthening democracy and and it's it's fascinating to hear how you started off with this large list of 100 possible recommendations and went through this deliberative process that sounds a lot like the negotiations over the constitution in terms of how to uh finally arrive at these uh 31 recommendations and there's there's so much in there uh in terms of modernizing institutions addressing inequalities that impact participation and voice in government uh the role and impact of media fostering this culture of civic participation there's a lot there um and given that the theme of our conversation tonight is what's next where should we start and why and hurry could i turn to you first yeah um you know it's hard to answer the question of where we should start because my instinct is we've got to do it all you know i mean um and you know you should feel good because we're going to give you guys 100 things to do and we only gave you 31. so we should consider that a victory right um you know and i i just but i'm also kind of serious in the sense that i i think that one of the challenges that we have in our discussions about democracy and uh we were talking about this a little bit um in uh before the panel started is this notion that um people want to find the silver bullet and i think often um as people are putting their ideas out there there are ways in which it's easier to kind of sell your idea if it seems like the the next silver bullet um but the truth of the matter is is that the work that we have to do is is complicated and it's multifaceted and it has to do with reforming our political institutions at every level the capital i institutions but then also improving the civic settings and the and the culture that we all inhabit and create around us and so i think part of what the report was trying to do is identify what the key places are um to take this you know multi-frontal attack so to speak in recreating and reimagining um imagining our democracy but what i will say is i think on the one hand it feels like maybe a non-answer to say um all of it is important but then on the other hand what i will say is part of what's really exciting to me is i think the report is also an invitation for people to imagine how can we be architects of the democracy that we want right and how can we design the system that we want and so in that sense it's saying look it's not just the work of our elected officials and the the people who win that manichaean fight that um pete set out for us but it's it's about the work that we're all doing together and that we all have a role to play so i think in that sense it it's returning the agency back to um to all of us um to to be a part of that process yeah i'll just jump in and say i love that word invitation in fact we probably should have put invitation on the cover of this uh it really to the question where you start first i would just say to the viewers read it and see where you intersect with this right this is an invitation to all of us it's it's it's not we're not making a request for certain people out there to do something this is really about saying all right here's a set of proposals that range everywhere from ways that we can intersect with civic culture all the way to some real major lifts that require constitutional amendments but what does that mean to you i mean i think about one of the proposals in there is around uh supporting and promoting statewide citizen redistricting commissions as a way of providing i think more inclusive redistricting processes for states and and counties and cities you know that started here in part in california really with a very grassroots movement that happened to catch the attention of one populist governor named arnold schwarzenegger and that bottom-up top-down approach resulted in a ballot measure that was approved here over a decade ago and that's how we in the largest state in america now draw our districts and so it really is an invitation to everyone to find where their role is in this because i think um it's it's very multi-pronged in its set of proposals okay carrie the only thing i'll add here to this note of invitation and for everybody who's watching and participating today um you know yes these 31 recommendations give many many points of entry depending on what you're interested in right if you're interested in engaging on reforming redistricting great if you're interested in uh building a culture of national service and an expectation for young people awesome if you're interested in making voting a universal expectation of citizenship like jury duty is go forth on that right there are all these different ways but um the thing that we took pains to put together and articulate in putting this report together is that it's not just a grab bag of 31 recommendations and kind of reach in and see what you come up with and see if you like it right there is a theory of action here um in that there is a virtuous cycle uh among three important dimensions of our democratic ecosystem uh one is our institutions our political institutions um and we've got recommendations that are pretty interesting and timely right now like expanding the size of the house representatives dramatically as a way to uh in a sense make the electoral college and the house a far more reflective and representative of of our nation uh another one that's quite timely is a proposal to put 18-year term limits on supreme court justices um so that there isn't life tenure anymore right there are institutional ideas like that but institutions are only one part of that virtuous cycle another part is civil society how do we in all those spaces that hari has been referring to today spaces where we gather organizations that bring people together and that stitch together social fabric uh organizations that are engaged in just service or faith activity um and all of what tocqueville would have called the little platoons of democracy and self-government right um that is a huge other part of our ecosystem and we've got a whole slate of other recommendations there for philanthropy to get engaged and help accelerate the spread of that movement to start cultivating the what you might think of as the civic 1 million the catalytic leaders all around the country who are leading uh that kind of bottom-up civil society work and then the third part of the civil uh of the virtuous cycle is civic culture our narratives our values our sense of shared history right and the recommendations we have there run the gamut from a deep deep commitment and recommitment to civic learning and civic education across institutions to a great endeavor that we want to humanities festivals and humanities institutions around the country to be part of which is to reimagine our nation's story uh and to find new answers to that perennial american question of who is us right and to do that in a coherent as pete put it top down and bottom-up way where we're all claiming the story we're all creating um a part of that new woven narrative and when you set those three things in motion political institutions civil society civic culture um you know if things are going well uh they feed on each other in a positive way like you were saying carrie and when things aren't going well the dysfunction in one infects the others right and i think for anybody who's trying to figure out what's next how do i plug in um yeah reach into the grab bag and find a recommendation you like but think about that bigger picture cycle and think about how you want to engage to move one part or another the cycle um and there's no right answer every one of us has to lift one piece of that but i think that's the invitation also that we want to extend i want to turn to some of the questions that are coming in through the q a and there's there's a theme across a few different questions so i'm going to take the liberty to try to blend some of them together and really looking at some of those challenges deep challenges of the current political moment there there have been comments raised about the wedge that seemed to be pulling the nation in two separate ways there are concerns that president trump hasn't conceded and there's this contested election narrative in some places there are concerns about whether there will be a peaceful transition or not and if all sides will honor the election results and and i think that the lies attention that we're seeing really in many facets of the society right now and um certainly within some of our our social media silos of um some of the worries that folks have about this current moment were in um is there any wisdom that you can share with us from the report about how we see ourselves through this particular moment and these tensions eat you want to take first crack yeah i'll jump in and i just want to come off a point that hari raised earlier which i think is foundational to this report and again grows out of the focus groups that we did around the country was this feeling of a lack of agency that politics was something happening to people or and i would argue that this is a much worse situation the politics was becoming just simply a spectator sport it was something to sit back and just watch these people battle it out back and forth and i think what was so encouraging as we were we were both seeking feedback on these proposals but also seeking ideas on proposals themselves throughout these focus groups was this it didn't happen in all the focus groups and didn't happen in all the commission conversations but you usually started with a place of feeling no agency and weakness and then coming to a place where you realize wow there really are some lovers here um and they're leverage that i can participate in that i can i can do something about it um i i am a great opponent of what i call the c-spanification of our politics that our politics has become so federally and nationally focused that the issues that really do impact our lives whether it's education whether it's trash pickup whether it's you know uh anything having to do with even even at the uh related to the environment that these are issues and decisions that we do have some control over and i think what the report does so powerfully is that it lays out yes there are some that will demand a constitutional amendment that's not something you can do on your own and i wouldn't advise it by the way don't try a constitutional amendment on your own but at the same time there are other places of engagement which are very community focused and community based where you can see success in a matter of months not decades and and i think that's a way that we find our way through this time is that we we look at the ways that we actually can affect and impact change uh that frankly some of these issues around recounts and all these other things we frankly don't have power over but that's not to say that we don't have any power and that's what i think again is so timely about this report you know i guess one thing i'll i'll say just you know trying to tune into the motivations of the people asking these questions um and i imagine many of them are anxious uh about this literal moment right now what's happening um in national politics and and the kind of presidential contest and um i'm pretty sure i'm not yeah i'm almost certain that uh our report does not contain the word trump um this was not a report written to this cycle um uh and it's not that we were playing the long game uh it's actually i've been thinking about it differently it's more that we were playing the deep game uh that everything that hari and pete and i have been talking about here um is the base layer the foundation uh from which uh you know we will determine whether we have a flourishing garden of democracy or just a bunch of weeds right and uh and and those habits and norms and practices require deep long patient investment now that does not mean that we are unaware of the dangers posed by reckless irresponsible leadership and reckless irresponsible breaking of norms that uh start to corrode the legitimacy of our institutions i think all of us um you know liberal and conservative you know want to conserve what is worth preserving in our institutions and in our systems uh and that is ultimately again a matter of faith i used that word earlier um and what is you know alarming in part to me but also frankly heartening to me about this moment uh is um a word i got and pete you know having worked in republican politics has many more such conversations than i do but i spoke recently to a couple of friends one in uh east texas one in uh central tennessee um who uh we're just reporting that where they are uh deep in mega country um most folks were putting away their signs putting away their flags getting on with life and accepting that the election was over and they had other things they needed to do they had to raise their families they had to get back to work they had to take care of things they were living their lives in their communities um were they happy about the result no do they maybe have lingering questions about you know funny business uh probably because they because some of the media they've consumed but but by and large they were getting back to life and stitching community together and that to me was heartening because i think that is in fact uh a reality on the ground across the country right now and the responsibility we have uh in this moment is to be vigilant uh against uh abuses of power uh in the now uh but also be thinking about that deep game and how we can accelerate and enrich the work there i want to lean into a another theme here and that has to do with the civics education that is a key component to really building that citizen participation we have one question in the chat asking about asking you all to share your thoughts on adding instruction to public schools about media literacy governmental process and democratic participation so we can have this engaged citizenry but i'd also love your thoughts not just on how we foster this in the public education context but for all of us who are in the adult world um who have finished our education um how do we help our our adults uh really engage in this process as well and i know i've got a room virtual room full of civics experts here how do we really help build this civic education and civic infrastructure muscle to really start pursuing some of these i changes jump in here um you know so i guess um you know so earlier um eric brought up tocqueville and um his notion of platoons of democracy and the quote from tocqueville that i like to think about all the time is this idea of schools of democracy you know where the places throughout our society that act as little schools of democracy and i think that in thinking about civic education um yes i absolutely think that it would be really important for us to and and there's a very vibrant conversation going on right now about how we strengthen civic education in k-12 schools um and what that means you know what is the common and obviously that's contested in a lot of ways but grappling through and struggling through that process i think is an important one for us to do as a society but then as to your point a lot of people are past k-12 schooling and so what does that mean and i think that we can we should expand our notion of the settings in which civic education can and does happen um and um you know tocqueville when he came to observe american democracy in the in the 19th century he was skeptical at first of about all these americans who kept doing things together and he thought it was kind of silly and quaint at first and then he realized over time that it wasn't just silly and quaint but that really it was you know that work of sort of coming together were places where people learned the habits and skills and capacities and motivations that they needed to be a part of a small d democratic society and i think that we shouldn't forget that those kinds of opportunities exist all around us um but you know we've um i think we've developed a habit of entering into them in different ways but but um to pete's point about agency we can change that you know like we um you know there's like what we are what we've been waiting for and so it's it's in our hands to um to be able to recreate the kind of spaces to make them the topvillian schools of democracy that um that we aspire to and i would just jump in there um as another tocqueville fan that happens to be a core text here and and changed my life i have to say if you have not read democracy in america um you know certainly not a comprehensive civics document but but one to help understand i think america in some unique ways i you know one of the sections in our report is uh about the ensuring the responsiveness of government and again in that we are take we are looking much more at local government processes as part of that and i think as we think about the civics education piece and i know eric's has writes and speaks on this all the time civics is both kind of the head you know how government works and i would guess that most of us don't know even how our local government works right i think that that is a piece of civics education i think is really really missing and one as adults we all need to have a better sense of um but it needs to be combined with a heart right and i found in a lot of the work that we do here at pepperdine is the heart despite whatever may be happening at the national level most people love the place where they live and the ability to practice civics locally where you're able to know and answer the question why do you love living in chicago why do you love living in seattle or malibu now the reasons you love living in malibu are obvious it's the most beautiful place in the world but that love i think then connects to action because that love should prompt us to have some sort of sense of stewardship which i think is an inherent part of citizenship is stewardship we are passing something on and then the agency that comes with that and then if we don't feel like we have that agency to argue for it i think those things tied together are manifested most easily at the local level but i would argue as tocqueville did that those the those civic muscles which are experienced at the local level then can radiate out so as opposed to starting at the national level in starting at the local level out i think is is a way that we really do build in the importance of civics education and civic engagement you know the i just have to um connect some of these dots here with um one thought which is um what pete and hari uh you're both talking about here and whether you're talking about local practice or um the way that all these settings beyond a classroom can be schools of uh democracy um is this fusion that um is very central to the work that uh that we do at citizen university but it's also i think implicit in the work of this commission um which is that citizenship requires a combination of power plus character you have to be fluent in power so when pete says most people don't know how their local government works that's true they literally have no idea who decides stuff right um and just becoming fluent in who's deciding things on all the things that actually affect me ranging from you know garbage pickup to policing um you know who's making those decisions i don't know they are right and they does not cut it anymore in american life as an answer we there's no they it's we right uh but that fluency and power has to be coupled with uh the other thing that's implicit in both what pete and hari are saying here which is a notion of civic character you can use the language of love you can use the language of stewardship you can use the language of just responsibility taking um but that those are virtues and values that have to be cultivated as much as memorizing three branches of government and federalist 51 or 52 right um that you those are habits uh back to tocqueville you know habits of the heart right and i think the the the idea here um is that for us to take civic learning seriously um is to recognize that not only does it bust out of a k-12 box uh and should be in how we all are uh living but it's also beyond the merely procedural part of government and self-government uh to this side of uh heart as pete is saying well i think you've all made a case for everyone who's listening to run out and and pick up a copy of tocqueville from the librarian from their local bookstore so i'm sure all our local booksellers are saying that's it accomplished and i want to echo that point about that you made pete about local government because we keep seeing in uh poll after poll after paul looking at uh trust in american democracy that people have the highest trust in their local governments and trust levels drop considerably as you go higher up the ladder to the national government so it does seem like such a natural place for people to start locally where you've got the trust where you have this opportunity for impact and and for those who have not nerded out on election results the way some of us do and tracking all this it really is fascinating to look at some of these local races and ballot issues and just the way that communities have organized to have a voice in their government it is just and it's inspiring and it happens in every single state and every single election and and i really wish there'd be more coverage of that because there really is a lot of citizen change that's being made um one other theme i want to touch on and i i realize that our hours like very quickly here and this is the concept of the concerns about inequality um right now our nation is in a moment of reckoning with systemic racism we know that there are racial and ethnic inequalities uh infused in so many aspects of our systems and institutions and the same with wealth inequality and and you know one of you men just mentioned power and and the role of citizen power how does that come into play with um these deep societal inequities and and what do you see in terms of the commission's work force and path to start to address and unwind some of these inequalities that we have in our system and to really make sure that we do have full participation of all of our communities in the process i'll jump in first you know um the 31 recommendations that we've got in this report our common purpose are actually grouped into six strategies uh and the first of those strategies goes straight carrie to the heart of the question that you're raising and that people are asking about in in these questions um and that is this deep structural inequality concentration of wealth a voice of clout um monopoly in different forms in different parts of our society uh and that's not just economic monopoly it's it's monopoly itself of voice and presence um and so the first strategy um which contains several of the recommendations here is about achieving equality of voice and representation um in our democratic system and again some of those proposals and recommendations have to do with things like changing the structure and the size of the house representatives um allowing for the possibility of multi-member uh districts um so that there's so that you can be uh more readily represented allowing for rank choice voting so that it's not just winner take all in a binary system and those are partly procedural ways to address the legacies of this inequality but i think a deeper set of answers does lie in the way you pose the question kerry that um you know the the the as much as is broken in our politics right now uh the remedy exists in the tools of our politics um and so what you see right now in terms of organizing certainly actually on both sides um you know i was going to say certainly um you know if you go all the way back to the tea party and to occupy wall street um both those were twin phenomena um born of the same circumstance uh and uh and that phenomenon is basically people generating brand new power out of thin air tea party didn't exist before those folks weren't showing up and mobilizing and scaring members of congress before occupy didn't exist before and hadn't elevated a fellow named bernie sanders from obscurity in vermont to kind of you know near uh presidential nomination status what happened was that people organized and started generating power out of thin air and they started to apply pressure not only through elections but through storytelling through media uh through norm changes uh through the kind of work that hari has documented in a lot of her books about bottom-up citizen organizing in this country and so um you know again no sugar coating no pollyanna like inequality is real and it's bad and it's grindingly getting worse uh and the remedy is just right there in our hands what we're trying to spell out in our common purpose um are uh tools and ways that people can actually um activate that agency yeah i'll you know i'll just jump in to say um you know i think the question is a really important one in the sense that um inequality is a big threat to democracy and and partly because one of the big differences between democracy as a political system for organizing um government and public life relative to other systems that are you know authoritarian systems and so on is that the big trade-off people have to be willing to make in democracy is people have to be willing to accept uncertainty over outcomes in order to have certainty over process whereas in an authoritarian regime you might have certainty over outcomes but you aren't very uncertain about the process right so in democracy i don't know if my person's going to win or not but i know i should know i should be able to know exactly what the process is through which we have to get there whereas an authoritarian regime i'm pretty sure who's going to win and what the outcome that is going to be and the government will guarantee a certain standard of living and so on and so forth but who knows what what kind of what processes are gonna lead us there and you know a lot of research shows that people are only willing to accept that kind of uncertainty when their basic needs are being met you know and so when people are in a position of feeling like they're struggling um to feed their families to make ends meet then people's willingness to accept that kind of uncertainty that makes democracy work is goes way down and so i think it is a really important question but you know to eric's point the remedy is in strengthening our system right and making our governmental institutions more responsive and helping you know strengthening the process and the tools that people have to hold government accountable to the very urgent needs that so many people face and i think that's what our common purpose is trying to do is to say you know we may all think about different ways of getting to that outcome but we all need to strengthen the process we can all try to hold our public leaders and public institutions accountable for the needs that we have and i'll just add here too again to go back to the local level i think that's where we've seen some real creative noted here in the report but some real creative ways that those who have not been at the table have gotten back to the table i'm thinking about the process of participatory budgeting for example that i knew is used a lot in chicago i mean chicago's been really one of the groundbreakers in using pb to engage people that really haven't been involved before in the actual budgeting process for the city and a lot of my work in working with cities to make them more inclusive and participatory frankly the challenges are much more technocratic than than frankly um intentionally exclusionary if you will that it it does need uh both perspective and process that allows and engages those who haven't usually been at the table to do so and so again i would i would look at that part of the report as well uh where we've seen some real changes in areas around inequity where where agency has been been provided engaged and and listened to i see that we have quickly run through our time here i want to offer each of you with our our last couple of minutes left if you have any closing remarks and and words of inspiration for our audience about where they can go for more information and how to get started already you want to go first sure well i would say everyone should obviously in addition to running out and buying tocqueville should of course go and get a copy of the report which you can do on the our common purpose website and um as we talked about it is an invitation and we hope that you'll you'll all take us up on it um and and be a part of the process of change um and the the sort of quote that i'll leave you with is one that i love which is by you know a jewish theologian who says that hope is belief in the plausibility of the possible as opposed to the necessity of the probable and i think part of what we're trying to do is equip people to make the plot the possible more plausible through the work that we all do together and i'll just put an additional point on the invitation you know the next steps on this report has been enlisting what we call champions in each one of the different strategy areas to be really the hands and feet of these proposals and and put them into action and so as you look through them if you're a part of a organization either locally statewide or nationally you said hey we're really already doing this work uh you know as broad as this report was we didn't cover everything and so we're really looking for champions to take and and put into practice uh the proposals here and the last note i'll say is that as we've been um inviting and it's truly a spirit of invitation champions uh to join us in this work we're we've set ourselves i think a a an audacious but very achievable goal which is that by 2026 the 250th birthday of the nation uh we want to have made substantial progress in all the recommendations that we laid out in this report and so we truly invite you to you know get a copy of our common purpose you can call the academy if you if you like old-fashioned paper reports i do um go to the website uh you know read it and as pete and hari and i've been saying find your angle of entry and then as you dive deep on a particular issue or particular recommendation keep that virtuous cycle in mind always be mindful of the ways in which culture and institutions and civil society are shaping each other and you know there's one word that rings throughout everything that we've just said here including that last quote that ari you gave and the word is faith faith in democracy is a fragile thing now for the reasons that hari just laid out really succinctly and and powerfully um and and it is kindled best as pete is demonstrating you know at the human scale where you know folks where you have relationships where you can see each other right um and we're not talking about blind faith we're not talking about indoctrination uh that you know believe harder in democracy no that's not what we're saying right we're saying let's make a democracy worth believing it uh and the way you do that is by showing up and the way we show up is by accepting invitations like the ones that we're offering here relentlessly to join us in this work in this project and be part of our common purpose wonderful thank you all so much uh eric harry peter thank you so much for sending this hour with us and many thanks to the chicago humanities festival for putting on this this event tonight thank you all for this rich discussion and i look forward to seeing our audiences engage and accept your invitation have a good evening all thank you thank you you
