[Myself] It's true. [Erreip91] Okay it will mean that we will try to kill others at this point. [Myself] He's shooting to us! Kill them! [the clash was impervious and while the battle was taking place I was trying to see if I saw any other ship or Vanrider on the horizon ] [Drezot] i was laughing while erreip91 was trying to take diplomatic action i don't think they will listen to us [Erreip91&Drezot] There's another one! [Myself] Okay then I'll go into the game too let's get them out [Drezot] all killed the possible suspects [VanRider] We're going to be pirate at this point. [Drezot] They started this fight they could also avoid at this point [Erreip91] they started [Van Rider] Yes but you decide to murder one member of their group accidentaly before It's normal they decide to defend theirself from us. equips multitool for mining not indeed the quickflare [The time has now come to enter this cursed cave] [Myself] Ok let's try to restore some order erreip91 be a bodyguard ok? [Erreip91] Yes i will waiting here guys [Myself] we count on you Activate the quickflare I feel sorry for the kids who died out here [Erreip91] I was trying to say to them don't shoot to us [Myself] yes but they had already received a loss if i had the same situation i would have the same reaction. [Drezot] the problem with the boys is that they targeted badly [Erreip91] Can you avoid guys to run in this cave? Because i don't want to follow you everyone like a mad guy I too turn on a flare on my suit wait a second ok? wait for me because I'm still trying to attack the flare [Myself] oh god you shouldn't actually activate it. [Drezot] How can i recognize which rocks are minable? [Myself] They are rocks that seem to have veins coming out of them and while our heroes who were not so many heroes went deeper and deeper into the cave finding new mineral rocks and endless tunnels placing signaling flares to trace their path [Drezot] how much can i earn with a load full of minerals? [Myself] It depends what do you find in the cave. because you have to know my dear viewers that in the caves you can really find different types of materials [Drezot] Can't you make an estimate? [Myself] It is not easy to make an estimate depends on what you find You could also hit big numbers like 50k of auec [Erreip91] Are you following us? [Erreip91] Yes just let me arrive to you but try to travel more meters by occasionally placing some signal flares in order to understand the way [Myself] ok I'm leaving you there every 50 meters [VanRider] I think I found what we came for [Drezot] I'm looking for rocks but without finding any! I don't know what to tell you! [Myself] You went through it several times, you should be more careful [Drezot] The only one that I translated now is you on it [Myself] What? [Drezot] I can't find any rock! and while the members of the group collected all these minerals from this cursed cave between various explosives and moments where suspense was cut like a knife [Drezot] Can you mining this one? [Myself] Yes I did. [Myself] Did you placed other quickflares [VanRider] here are too many branches [Myself] Ok wait for us there and place other signaling fires [VanRider] I've found the poor guy in this cave. [Myself] Well done! [Erreip91] I'm going up the cave to eventually cover the exit [Myself to Drezot] Here there's another minable rock! Right here. [Drezot] I did not see her Are you mean this? [Myself] Yes [VanRider to myself] This poor man has armor similar to your Arctic [Myself] Are you serious? [Vanrider talking about me] maybe you will make the same end? What happened Drezot? I had heard a strange noise [Erreip91] All be silent and do not move At this point it really seemed like something was going to happen and instead everything went on quietly [Drezot] How do you see how many rocks i collected? [Myself] Press i on your keyboard from that moment when we were able to find the poor victim again, we decided it was time to go back. everything seemed claustrophobic and our only desire was to go out [vanrider] did we go wrong? [Drezot] It seems that the quickflare have disappeared isn't it that someone has removed there? [Myself] I don't think follow me in the meantime Drezot [Drezot] hadn't we posed here? [Myself] From here! we don't need flares there is already something that tells us that we are almost at the exit [Drezot to VanRider] will you come up with us? [VanRider] Yes, I only went the wrong way and I was about to lose the situation had really become thorny for our heroes [Drezot to every member of the group] it takes you so long to get out of this cave [Myself] Come on we are almost out one last effort [Myself to Erreip91] Are you still there? I'm going out I'm finally outside of this cursed cave! [Erreip91] Well done! [Myself] I'm out. FINALLY! I go inside the vehicle and position myself in the turret ready to shoot and while our hero was about to position himself and wait for the other crew members [Erreip91 to Drezot] C'mon Drezot just last step! Returning to the previous speech, I tried to use the diplomatic way [Myself] But with poor results it causes Drezot [Drezot] Maybe they couldn't hear us Maybe when they heard that I was laughing they didn't believe you anymore [VanRider] why are you wasting time? [Myself to VanRider] We were waiting for everyone to get out of the cave [VanRider] I'm already on the cyclone [Myself] Ok Erreip91 try to get inside of the Ursa Rover [Erreip91] I'm coming [Drezot to VanRider] Let's come back at home! [Myself] Let's go back to the carrack [Myself to Erreip91] Follow the cyclone [Erreip91] I'll do! [Erreip91 to all the members of the crew] Attention my radar signals me that there is a contact! [VanRider] Yes I noticed it too there is a contact nearby to our spaceship! [Myself] I hope they are not waiting for us near the carrack [Drezot] We are damned dead Get out of the cyclone! [Drezot to Van] Get OUT! NOW! [VanRider] I died guys And while on the horizon the enemy ship was about to point us the irreparable happens [Erreip91] It's not POSSIBLE WE ARE STUCK! [Myself] Will we be able to return to the carrack? If we die We will also lose our inventory [Erreip91 to myself] Try to turn off the turret and see if we can somehow turn around [Drezot] I died too ... [Myself] The only way is to get out of this vehicle at this point! [Myself to Erreip91] Get out of this vehicle! NOW! We are dead...
