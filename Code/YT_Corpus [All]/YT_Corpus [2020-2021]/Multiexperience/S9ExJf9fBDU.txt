Alexa ask chef to show me that paella recipe I looked at last night. Here is the recipe for traditional Paella Valenciana. All right, let's cook. How much rice do I need? 350 grams Paia rice. How many cups is that? It is 1-3/4 cups. I don't have green beans. Can I replace the green beans or something else? Yes you could use snap peas instead. Add green beans to my grocery list. I have added green beans to your grocery list. Okay what's the next step? Pour in about a liter of the chicken stock. Are there any wines that would pair well with this recipe? How about a chilled dry Rosatto from Navarra? Can you let me know when this step is done? I'll start a 10-minute timer for you. Ten minutes is up. Time for the next step.Thanks MDX
