 hi I'm Heather commercial TV we are live in the smarter with gardener social studio and gardener IT symposium Expo in Orlando Florida and I am joined by Darrell Plummer vice-president analyst and Gartner fellow hi Darryl hi how are you doing and Darryl is going to talk to us about the Gartner top ten strategic predictions for 2020 MBI came out today you just shared it with attendees at the conference I did and we released it out onto digital it sounds like a nerd you press releasing out there so we're really excited to talk about it's always an anticipated list one of our most popular pieces of home it's fun for me to i get to play karnak the cat investigator in the future right yeah I mean who doesn't want to hear about predictions right and they're really exciting this year I'm gonna talk about the theme in a minute and you will get to ask a or your questions later in the program so post them in the comment section we'll be taking them but first order talk a little bit about how you compile the list each air and and how you came down to the ten that made it onto this year's list well that's actually a difficult process because we source predictions from all across research and advisory services and in that process we usually get some 150 predictions to start with and we've got to boil them down to ten so the hard part is to be able to go through all of them and say what makes a top prediction what's compelling that will be interesting to a wider range of people and then we brought it down to about 30 on the first run and then we have to get down from from 30 to that 10 and that's a very very difficult process now sometimes we wind up getting down to six or seven that are left and we have to figure out how we're gonna build back up to ten oh really oh yes because every now and then a prediction will fall through so we have to build back up but it's a laborious process with a team of you know five or six of us working across research to make sure that we've got the right topics and our are the Gartner analyst submitting different ones and voting and making arguments for them or does it really just come down to that team that's kind of arguing back and forth hey I think this is important and CIOs IT leaders need to be aware of it well certainly the analysts will submit the the predictions we have a board of Chiefs of research different people from different parts of research which will vote on which ones are the more compelling ones and then the core team is going to go through and actually narrow and refine that last group down to ten so there are multiple stages where voting is half happens but eventually the team has to decide is this going to work or not right and what's important is that they aren't just technologies they're about technology but there are predictions showing you talk a little bit about the distinction there absolutely the strategic predictions we try to make them strategic not just about technology but they are predictions which is a statement about the future of something that will happen in a time certain now we are we try to also make people understand that our predictions are not just statements about the future they are planning assumptions assumptions about the future on which you can base your plans for the next few years three to five years usually and in that process we're trying to make a concise statement we usually say twenty-one words you know around there is good and something that people can act on and that's how we distinguish them from just talking about the future right so act on you mean I need to be thinking about this and aware of it for my horizon for strategy for business overall not just the IT departments right absolutely yes the idea is that we're going to make them aware the reader has to be aware of things that they must have on their radar now because acting later will mean you're acting too late and these predictions are supposed to be strategic so they will cover business they will cover technology they recover individuals Society any any areas fair game for a top prediction but the idea here is to make sure that we get something that says there is a compelling reason that you should do something about it right and I think that's important to remember as we go through the list because sometimes they sound a little far out but what Darrell is really pointing out is that we had we had this group come together and say these are the predictions it's for your planning important note though important though is that we don't always cover every topic as the goal is not to cover every topic the goal is to find compelling strategic planning assumptions that should be acted on starting now okay so if you don't see a prediction that you wanted to hear about that doesn't mean we didn't read written it it just means it didn't make the top ten we have about 600 other predictions that we publish around the same time and those will be coming out and research over the next several months all right right this is kind of the beginning of prediction season at garden okay so let's talk about the theme because then once you call through that big list of a couple hundred and come down to ten you then have to pick a theme or you you organize into a theme how does that come about another difficult process because the predictions can come from anywhere and therefore they may have no direct relationship to one another however what I've done I've done this more than 15 years and it's it's an interesting process where we have to figure out what the connections are and often time there are indirect connections between the predictions when you find the indirect connections you will be able to find a storyline in there for instance we are themed this year is that the technology is changing the human condition and when we look at that we think well what is how is technology affecting humanity how is it feck ting what we call human and then we say well what's the common thing about affecting humans well it's we relate to technology in different ways different people for different things relate to technology in different ways so that led us to a second half part of the theme which was to changing our relationship to technology and then lastly we said well what do people get disappointed or they get scared what's their response to it and that gave us the third part of our theme which is changing and resetting your expectations about what technology will okay all right now we're really curious let's get into the predictions so the theme is how humans are interacting with technology or how technology is changing the human condition which i think is really compelling well I'll kind of living that right now and of course there are more off they're optimistic elements to that and a number of them cover that and some not quite as much let's talk about the first one it's a first prediction well the first prediction is really about something that comes out of the fact that we are at the first point in human history where we're able to actually change the nature of what it means to be human typically the human condition human humanity has ruminated on what the human condition is since we've been able to ruminate okay absolutely been able to look out and say you know are we living happy lives where do we live how do we think about life how do we treat one another and so forth that changes as societies change but what it means to be human pretty much responds the same now we've gotten to a point where we can actually now begin to alter things that are part of what human beings are for instance embedding technology in the human body when you start doing that you can't you create a situation where human beings are able to do things that they couldn't do before and those things are increasingly digital things connecting them to the world so we're actually talking about what happens when you get to a point where technology is embedded in the human body enhancing and augmenting human beings and they come to work what then so the first prediction is really about the fact that we're going to see an extension of bring your own device policies remember that when you used to bring a smartphone from home oh yeah everybody was afraid oh they're gonna bring their smartphones and what do we do about it what happens when someone walks in and they've got a flash drive embedded behind their ear or they've got a network chip embedded in their hand so that they can actually connect to your network and you don't even know they have a device so policies about bringing your own enhance now must be created and will extend bring-your-own-device to get to that point okay very interesting bring your own enhancement and then the second one is also about augmenting the human condition correct well it is but it's augmenting in a different way now we have forever dealt with the fact that some human beings have disabilities disabilities will prevent the human being from reaching the full physical potential of the human form and we know that those with disabilities will struggle to be able to do some of the things that normal able-bodied individuals and the idea of you know what's normal is actually changing so an able-bodied individual might be able to run a certain speed but a disabled person who has you know lost their legs for some reason and are giving given blades as replacements can run faster than an able-bodied person who has normal ordinary legs so what I always say is disabilities are leading us to generating super abilities where those who are disabled go super normal they go beyond the norm that human beings are used to doing and that's what we're talking about here we're saying that by 2023 the number of people with disabilities that are working is one to triple because of the use of AI and advanced emerging technologies these technologies will make it possible for someone who is perhaps a paraplegic to actually interact with the rest of the world or to do a job there's a project called GaN Cafe which was started late 2018 was a temporary project that allowed people who were isolated in a situation where they were paralyzed to be able to control a robot in a cafe so the robot would serve people in the cafe but it's being controlled by someone who can't move they're using combination of I control you know hi movements combination of thought control even to be able to control these remote devices and participate as a valued member of that workforce so we're seeing that ability turn into a super ability because I can't do that and now with with disabilities gaining technology edge the super abilities are beginning to emerge and really brings a whole population into a new place especially for the use of technology absolutely now and the next thing about it just an addendum there is only 31 percent of disabled people are employed at this point so this makes a huge impact huge impact huge impact is an untapped pool of talent and not only that but companies that employ and use disabled workers are more productive they are more profitable ok and there are there are more effective places to work so it's a good thing all around right certainly ok now the next one though it has a different angle I think you were channeling my teenagers and when you're talking about shopping and the potential that it can become an addiction right because you know technology it's an incredible when we hear about what it can actually enable that could not have been enabled otherwise like with disabilities but then it also creates its own ills sometimes we're shopping so talk to us about that prediction well human beings are creatures of habit we always do the same things over again now think about this every time that you go and take your shower you know when you when you finished your run your you know five mile run you run in five miles a day right okay yes after you finished it you go in the shower you probably start washing yourself in the same spot every time you know now think about that that will really creeped you out because how we start by watching right here and the notion that people have habits that they they do over and over again leads to the idea that people are addictive by you know by generation of those habits now we have a lot of things that we do can be addictive we do things that draw us in and the reason why I pick should happen is often because of chemical responses in the brain endorphins are released that make us feel good and so we want to do it more right now social media has us all addicted we're always online to see what happens when someone posts something about you it makes you feel good you want to see more now translate that to the advertisements that you see in social media that takes you in the shopping and the experiences in shopping are getting more addictive too because the user experience is designed to draw you in to let you see all of the options that you could buy to see what all the deals are and if you don't respond they give you more deals and it's making it so that people who shop are being able to be locked into this addiction I need more I want more I'll get more and when you do too much of it you get bankruptcies you know you get debt and that can be a bad thing you have to return a lot absolutely it's a growing thing we're saying that the World Health Organization is going to declare online shopping I did an addictive disorder interesting and and it's it's where technology's just enables a human condition though is what you're talking about the psychology behind it which is interesting as well the next prediction is always around that area as well which is talking about emotion ai playing into that talk about well you know the prediction is around the idea that emotion is going to be used to actually determine what advertisements you see you know and if you if you think about it we can now track facial expressions we can identify faces you know with AI we can also identify your emotional state based on the tone of your voice based on the expressions on your face even based on your body temperature so now since we can do that we are in a position where advertisers will exploit your current emotional state they'll be able to say you're happy today so I'm gonna you know I'm gonna fill you up with what advertisements that leverage your happiness towards a purchase if you're unhappy I'm gonna send you advertisements that are designed to make you happy and then you want to buy more from me so they're targeting us based on the emotions that we're displaying at any given time now we know if you have a voice of a virtual personal assistant Assyria Cortana and Alexa Google home whatever one you have we often we often interact with them in very human ways some people are very rude to them some people are very nice to them but imagine the day when you're rude to your virtual personal assistant and it's rude right back and imagine the day when you're nice to it and the nicer you are to it the more deals you get on products that you can buy interesting you see so it can be used either way if you want to be nice you can get benefits if you don't want to be nice you might get it thrown back in your face but it is interesting that they don't respond back you're welcome when you say thank you interesting you know it sounds creepy when you talk about it but I think that when like with most advertising now even it's not driven by emotion when you get it and it's relevant you're still happy to get it yes so I suppose if it's reading your emotions and it's serving you up something that makes you feel better if you're unhappy you'd probably welcome it probably welcoming becomes a shopping I would say you know check what your kids are doing because they can get addicted to it as well and you know if they're buying things on an account that you're not watching regularly it can really build very quickly but we mostly are worried about adults who who are just you know it's just in the consumer culture to such a degree that they have to have it now my worst thing is when I'm on social media and they provide those advertisements they all I always feel like I got to have that I got to have it now and they're always useless things that I don't need but in the moment I'm feeling like I got to have it and more and more of those ads are associated with the kinds of things I've been texting or you know tweeting or the subjects that have been posted on my and they're definitely trying to exploit it right right so tracking though makes a difference in these situations from a broader level if you want to talk about that as far as the prediction that talks about a bigger level of tracking well I understand that these predictions are tied together as I said indirectly they're tied together so they create a thing if we think about the the prediction around the addiction to shopping and then connect that to the emotion tracking you see that emotion tracking can actually make it more likely that you're going to shop more so those two are related then there's a third one about behavior tracking an Internet of behavior if you will where everything that we do is tracked as an event so human actions have become an event that's tracked by someone which could be a facial expression or or a an explosion of emotion and they could use that so now we're tied to the other two predictions but this one is a little more insidious even than the other two because when you have people companies tracking your very actions they can either be very helpful to you or they can go too far now most people think oh I don't want anyone tracking my actions but in fact we do we want them tracking our actions to keep us safe to actually give us advantages if you look at something like you know allstate has an app that actually tracks the power you drive your car give you insurance premium benefits because you drive well and if you drive badly they can actually you know punish you for that now these this kind of tracking we welcome what we don't welcome is if they start tracking every time we do a jackrabbit start from some stop or we every time we exceed the speed limit we don't want that kind of tracking because we begin to perceive it as tracking that's going to try to shape our behavior towards a norm that we really don't necessarily want to always adhere to but there's a balance point you got to find it now we use this term Tecla Librium to talk about the balance between digital and non-digital capability but any women within digital there's a balance of you know helpful versus intrusive that we have to actually watch out for when we look at the intrusive side it could get really bad it can be good too in China they have the Social Credit system which allows you to get better credit from better social behavior worse credit from bad social behavior so it can go either way I don't know about that one okay we're gonna keep moving maybe we'll come back to that if we have time there's a lot we could talk about that the next one is tied more to the workplace I think this is interesting when you think about what's possible to really get into productivity in the workplace sure come on talk about that well you know the next the next prediction we had was um about the idea that when you're when you're working you are confined by the applications that you're given to use now there who hasn't complained about an app but they've been told they have to you know I'm sure no one complained but it's something you could complain about well what we're saying now is that business workers in the workforce are going to orchestrate their business application experiences the same way that they orchestrate their music listening experiences so oh your playlists absolutely I don't know a lot of music services we don't we don't have just playlists anymore we have you know a listening experience that's based on potentially our mood certainly based on the kind of music we listen to and where we might be or what time of day it is even but the idea of being able to pick the application function that you want at a given point in time because you need to work in a given style or on a given project will be more like that now you might if you're a developer you're probably thinking you know no no they got a right code and you got to reconfigure it and absent have a purpose in a place they do but the reality is that we have now had an application explosion all the parts have broken up into little pieces and they're all over the place we access them through application programming interfaces we we have now data that is available to us through streams we have components and containers and everything and services all broken apart what we have to do is now orchestrate them into what we want and the tools are getting easier to do this I use the example of Microsoft's power bi and their power apps tools which allow the average person to be able to orchestrate how their app function works and to be able to create an experience that's more tailored to them at a given point in time so when you can do that you get more satisfied workers who are more effective in their jobs right they have more control over the apps absolutely kind of like backward me at BYU you know bring your own device okay if you have questions for Derral we're going to take them in just a couple minutes so post them in the comment section where we're gonna make it through the next four predictions in just a couple minutes so these are the speed predictions okay we're going to the back of the list let's see the next one has to do with mobile cryptocurrency you fill us in on that it's a quick one we realized that not everyone in the world has a bank account and we but we realize also that more people in the world have mobile services than have a bank account and when we think about this cryptic cryptocurrencies are a way of paying for things without you needing a bank account and start you'll have a mobile cryptocurrency account accessible through your phone through mobile cryptocurrency payment systems and you'll be able to do that now when you look at asia-pacific there's gonna be a huge rise in the number of people 700 million some odd people rising over the next few years in having a notes cryptocurrency accounts in sub-saharan Africa same thing they're coming in with these accounts and so what we're saying is that people who don't have a bank account are going to have a mobile cryptocurrency account to actually make payments so just skip right there just skip right through okay and then the next one I'm blockchain related but different because blockchain is an underlined technology very different than just the cryptocurrency absolutely blockchain can be used for is used for cooked or currency systems yes and it's fabrics underneath it like hyper ledger can be used for that but it's also a good system it turns out for being able to detect variances in content in other words fake content can be identified through a blockchain now we introduced in 2000 a term called counterfeit reality counterfeit reality was a term that described the intentional creation of video audio a textual content that was convincingly real but in fact was entirely fake now in today's world that's called either fake news if you're looking in the more broad political sense or it's called deep fakes when you're looking at videos so we're seeing more and more videos that are created that are showing people doing something where you believe it's absolutely real which isn't and it's not just doctored videos this whole production of you know a fake you know our representation so blockchain can be used to actually detect variances inconsistencies and to authenticate that content as fake or real so the prediction is that we're going to see a great deal of use of blockchain to authenticate the reality of content which is a good use of that for sure because how many issues that many people have said blockchain is a solution searching for a problem but in fact it's not Rock chain can be used in a lot of different ways this is clearly a problem and one was blockchain can affect absolutely okay number nine has also to do with some oversight yes correct yes number nine is really about the idea that the g7 is going to the g7 countries are going to be looking for certifications for AI developers who are doing life critical work now when you look at what happens with AI developers have to learn a whole new style of development it's not just writing algorithms it's about setting up mathematical relationships and most people who use those solutions will never understand how the decisions in those systems are actually made so if you want to trust developers to build life critical systems right let's say you go to the hospital the doctor says you have to have an operation you say Thank You doc I know you're good at it you'll be there and he says I'll be there but I won't be doing the operation it's going to be a surgical robot doing the operation at that point I'm hoping you'll ask who's the programmer you know who wrote these AI routines for this surgical robot because I want to know if they're certified the way my surgeon would have been the programmers hold all the power they hold the power and they hold the ability to actually cause chaos so we're saying there's going to be an interest in the g7 countries to get certifications for those AI developers interesting okay so for the tenth prediction you're talking about timelines for digital animation which ties into a lot of this correct it does you know because all of this is really about how you live in a digital society and a digital society needs digital services so businesses are going to have to deliver more and more digital services to the societies that it serves now I've said many times that digital is something that you there's not something that you are it's something that you do okay because many companies say well when will I know I'm a digital business and I say it's irrelevant when you know in your digital business the question is are you doing enough digital things and the more of them you do the more you can support your society digitally to help solve problems unfortunately we we have noted that at this point for large traditional enterprises not the ones that were born digital but those traditional enterprises it's going to take twice as long and cost twice as much to transform to digital mostly because the operations of the business are very very inner woman with processes technologies and procedures that are hard to break out and the harder they are to break out you can't do that one thing which is magical and digital which is to blur the distinction between the real physical world and the virtual world in any real great digital solution you will see that kind of distinction being made where the physical world and the virtual world blur whether it be using a human form robot or a virtual personal assistant or an AI advisor they're using sensors to tell what's going on what's your face looked like where are you standing and so forth so we're able to blur those things and we get digital it's just going to take companies longer to get there then we've hopefully okay very interesting ten predictions now we're ready for our viewer questions are you ready don't we have something have come in okay Carlos from Norway asked what is the most requested topic out of the predictions to discuss from clients and prospects well yes and it's pretty easy to answer the most requested topic is a broad category of capabilities called AI everyone wants to talk about AI now everyone will have their own spin on what they want up machine learning you know conversational user experience deep learning you know all these things can be categorized under the broad umbrella of AI but it is the most consistent thing that were asked about right now if you would ask me this question ten years ago it would have been cloud and cloud is still one that is there that we get asked about it a lot but AI has really begun to rise in importance okay question two Arvind from India how do we draw a line between helpful and true-self the line between helpful and intrusive is by and large depending on your own personal preference you know if you think about this and now let me expand on it because it's not just your personal present your personal preference comes from quite often your cultural you know situation some cultures will accept more tracking more intrusion than others Western cultures tend to push back on any kind of tracking because we all read George Orwell's you know nineteen eighty-four and so we're all paranoid about Big Brother now societies where there are a lot more people will have much more close-knit relationships across all those people will be less concerned about that so how do we make how do we find a lot it's a personal decision in the end but when the the the solution is giving you a value proposition you didn't have before versus when it's actually taking information from you that it does not need in order to give you the value proposition that's where the line exists makes sense okay our third question David from Utah asks what effect will change management have on software adoption as it pertains to digital transformation well change management is a discipline that has been around for quite a quite a long time here's the problem change management is about managing changes often in systems or processes or what people do the problem is that digital is now about not only changed but it's about innovation and it's about disruption those are three different things all right change here I just made a change if I move my cup from one side of the table to the other but I didn't create any new value proposition it's still a cup I can still pick it up I can still drink from it whatever I want to do innovation is about creating a new value proposition and when you create a new value proposition you may add new processes that you're not familiar with you've never done before and your change management process itself may need to be altered and further when you go to disruption which would be changing the very nature of the drink maybe it turns from water to wine alright which neither one of us can do but if it did then all of a sudden there is a disruption that changes the nature of what you're drinking the purpose for drinking and that requires an even newer set of skills so change management can hold it all back if we only think about changing the way we thought about it in the 80's 90's and 2000's we have to start thinking about innovation and disruption and what that means to our skills in managing through right okay our last question is from Paul in New York and he asks what is your position on voice technology adoption in 2020 voice technology adoption I'm a big fan you know the thing is that voice technology has really come such a long way that we are getting the ability to have voice in everything no matter where you are no matter what you're doing you can have voice respond of course you don't necessarily want to be in a cubicle sitting in an office where everybody's talking to their computer and every computer is talking back so there are circumstances where you have to mix voice you know interaction with proper you know sonic technology to broadcast sounds directly to your ears or they wear headphones or whatever you but my belief is that 2020 is going to be a year of voice it's going to be a year where we say that voice moves from just a mechanism for input of information to a mechanism for all sorts of things like diagnosing your condition our health condition we can detect diagnose early onset dementia from the sound of your voice and healthcare organizations are going to be using that to actually answer certainly insurance organizations the pinpoint when you know a person may be you know ready for a policy or not so I think voice is going to be there we will find that voice is very useful in a lot of ways that we may not have thought about before now I'll tell you that a lot of the virtual personal systems are are you know very interesting at first and then people sort of get used to them they don't talk to them as much but we will find that voice through chat BOTS through stronger conversational units user experience systems and through the ability for people to actually have multi-part voice response of multiple people in a conversation that it will return sitting to rise so I think 2020 will be a good year for voice ok I did get one last one and we're gonna take really quickly and then we will finish up Kathleen from Belgium asks how soon will we see practical implementations of blockchain given the technical challenges practical implementations of implementations of blockchain already exist there are some practical implementations in power generation their practical implementations in financial services you know where ecosystems of financial companies that are performing transactions work through a blockchain to actually generate community trust around those transactions but I gather the question is really going to her when is it going to hit sort of a breakthrough point where we see them widespread and it's actually gonna take a little longer than we might have hoped because we are looking at a situation where a lot of companies just don't know what to use blockchain to do what do you do with it so they're still trying to figure that out and they've got to figure out that using blockchain is about ecosystems about joining groups of others not just doing something as if you own a database on your own so we will see probably a few more years before we get to the point where some of these breakthrough things begin to happen that are more routine I would even give it five years before it becomes something that everybody expects all the time right makes sense okay now we have just a couple closing questions about your experience at got an IT symposium Expo how many of you attended how many of these conferences have you attended if you've lost count it's okay I lost count this is my 24th Gartner IT Expo symposium that's 24 no I don't I'm not counting all the other ones they happen all around the world Lando's 75 including Barcelona and Gulf Coast and all the other locations if we could convince the conference's team to add a new city and they do have new locations we just have Toronto last spring what city would you encourage them it's a long run it's easy Honolulu I'm there I gotta get better we'll do live coverage and finally with your one piece of advice for attendees to get the most out of garden IOT symposium Expo well my advice to get the value is to talk to people talk to the your peers talk to the analysts grab them in the hallways don't let them get to their next meeting whatever you got to do got to talk to people because the whole purpose of this is community it's about bringing people together to share experiences to share ideas and if you don't do that if you just go to the sessions and you know take a few notes you'll miss the flavor of the event so you've got to talk to people and and talk to them not only in the morning and in the afternoons but talk to them late at night after they've had a few to drink that's when it gets really interesting and some of the more interesting conversations start there and end up in a booth with an analyst during a one-on-one the next day that's the thing that you have to do to really make this thing great well thank you so much Darryl was a pleasure talking to you we love tearing about the prediction thank you for joining us stay tuned for more live coverage here and visit smarter with gardener for our live coverage of gardener IT symposium Expo take care
