 [Music] hello and welcome to optimize I'm Jason a technical writer at Google and I'm Q product manager at Google today we're going to show you how to create a multi-page experience and optimize so what's a multi-page experience it's just like a regular experience that you would create that target specific visitors but it's going to appear at different locations across your site for example it could appear on your landing page your product page and your checkout page here's how we're going to create it first thing it to do is identify the pages that you want to modify then you'll create your variants then decide who should see them and then determine what you want to measure so q what are some reasons somebody would want to run a multi-page experience yeah Jason so today we're gonna show you a demo flower shop and we've gone ahead looked at imagine some analytics data from Google Analytics we noticed that what's happening is a lot visitors are adding an item to the shopping cart but ultimately they abandon and then we the website altogether so we have a hypothesis that we'd like to do today and implement which is we're going to see if free expedited shipping can help increase and nudge folks into completing the purchase we're gonna try and promote this on to parts of the website the first being the homepage itself and then the second is right when you're at that shopping cart to try and get that nudge to finish so with that in mind let's go ahead and jump right in so here you see the homepage of our demo site and then second is the checkout page now notice that I've already gone ahead and added an item to the shopping cart so with those two pages let's go ahead and jump into the optimized home page so here we eye as always we're gonna go ahead and start by creating experience and then we're gonna give it a name so I'm gonna say expedited shipping trial it's already gone ahead and pulled in the home page URL and we'd like to set this up as an a/b test so we're ready to go I'll click create now what we need to do is we need to create a copy or snapshot of the home page and to do that we're gonna click add variant what's actually going on is by creating a snapshot we're just modifying the snapshot and nothing is yet live on your site so now in order to go ahead and make those changes I want I'm gonna go here and click Edit great here's the home page being pulled up we're ready to go I want to promote this front and center and so I'm going to click on the CR collection right click and in this case let's try to edit the HTML so I'm going to say free expedited shipping this BR is just so that it shows up on to line and I'm going to offer it only on the designers choice bouquet let's take a look apply there it is right there notice the designers choice bouquet is one of many the idea here is that we're going to try it on one and essentially if future sales of that one are higher relative to the other inventory items then that gives us some strong evidence that actually free expedited shipping is increasing conversions and we might want to go ahead and apply it to all the products on our site so with that I'm done with the home page I'm going to go up here to the top right click save and done now since this is multi-page we actually now also need to make some changes to our shopping cart so down here if I scroll you'll see the option to add a page page too I've already got the URL of the shopping cart and so I pasted it in there I'm gonna save and now notice what happens is we've gone ahead and we still have page 1 which is our home page here and now we have pitch two with a URL over here of our shopping cart I'm going to go ahead and click Edit to make the changes I want here's that shopping cart page now this time I'm going to change the text there and right click instead of in it edit HTML I'll go ahead and just edit the text this time and just to nudge visitors I'm gonna say right here free expedited shipping click done on the bottom right and great that's the only changes I want to make there save and click done okay now the next step as Jason mentioned is who gets to see this right that's right here as we can see under audience targeting it's already set to all visitors coming to the website and though down here when it says manage variants you can see that 50% are going to see the original version of the website and 50% are going to see the expedited shipping offer so I'll leave it as a default set already there lastly what determines who's the winner so in this case I'm trying to nudge folks to get to the checkout page and so I'm gonna add an experiment objective here to specify that choose from list I've already got that set up as a goal in Google Analytics so that checkout click that button is what I'm gonna select and we're ready to go the last thing I would do is run Diagnostics to make sure everything looks great and then back up to my variance you can click preview on each one to go ahead and make sure that it visually looks correct and with that you just click start and you're on your way back to you Jason thanks q that was great you're welcome so that's how easy it is to create a multi-page experience with Google optimize to find out more check out our other videos and visit the optimized resource hub
