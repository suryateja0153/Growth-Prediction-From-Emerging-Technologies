 - CHRIS: Yes, we´ll have to talk later, though. I´m headed for sprint review and I´m already late. Yes, alright. Thanks, bye! - ERIK: Ah, hi, Chris! - CHRIS: Hey Erik! - ERIK: How are you? Do you have a minute? CHRIS: Actually no. I´m on my way to the release 5.0 sprint review. But why don´t you just follow me? - ERIK: Cool, release 5.0, good cue! Can you give us some insides? what to expect? - CHRIS: Oh, a lot! Of course, we have focused on the benefits for the application creation. New application editor with "what you see is what you get" designer and so that is actually everything you need to create apps. - ERIK: Ok, "what you see is what you get" For non-developers like me: How easy is it going to get? - CHRIS: Extremely easy. You can see live what you are creating and build your apps way faster and more visual So, it is going to be a big deal and that´s why I will take another look at it now! - ERIK: Very cool Is there anything else? A highlight? Another feature, that you want to tell us about? - CHRIS: Sure, there is the new db designer and the realtime preview for mobile devices. But I don´t want to divulge more features at this point all in due time. - ERIK: Okay, good! Then go inside! Have fun! - CHRIS: Alright, thanks! - ERIK: Thank you! Bye! Yes, it will be very exciting. Release 5.0, end of january. Not even two months left until the official release date. It´s a really cool thing and it is going to be a milestone in the Simplifier development. And for those who cannot wait to get to know the new features: Via freemium we offer users the possibility to test the new features ahead of time. As of now, I cannot exactly give the date. But it will definitely be in the run up to the release. We will fill you in accordingly and keep you posted. In so far, see you and until next time! Ciao
