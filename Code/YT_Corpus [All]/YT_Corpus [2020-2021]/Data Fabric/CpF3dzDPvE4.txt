 last year at HP discover antonio nari painted an almost utopic picture of an everything as a service company by 2022 this year HP proved they are not only serious of getting there fast there's a new cloud company in the market [Music] hpe missed out on the first cloud hive ten years ago but this year they have proved that they are actually creating a new gloutch segment for the enterprises and that segment is actually larger than that of public Laos HPE is transforming from a box mover into a real cloud company and they are doing it faster than any of us anticipated before we get any deeper a short disclaimer I am proud to have HP and Intel spawns or another video of mine and if you are new to the channel this is where we discuss everything around enterprise IT from bare metal to cloud native and if you liked the video support the channel by liking it and if you haven't yet subscribe thank you I think big events like HP discover need to be in person no virtual event will ever reach the engagement level wow factor and lead in the relationships like in-person events do having said that I am surprised how well the energy flow and passion of the presenters transmitted to the home couches a very positive surprise to me the best part of this year's discovery is that it's not over yet it's still continuing for a month with new theme every week go to hp.com slash discover and register and find out more then to the big news quoting Daniel Newman from future on research I mark this event as a turning point for HP and I could not agree more the company is transforming dramatically and suddenly the whole strategy just seems to make sense everything seems very clear even simple which is rare in this industry same time last year Antonio nari committed to driving HP forward as a service company across the board and promised that the whole HP portfolio would be available through green leg by 2022 to help deliver cloud experience for those apps remaining in the data centers and there's a lot of them a very eye opening ideas a study from 2019 shows apps that can easily move to the cloud already have yet 70% of apps remaining in the data centers for various reasons like cost compliance performance security of the data gravity things etc etc the plan to offer everything through Greenlake sounded hip and pop but still last year the goal of Greenlake was a bit unclear it seemed more or less just another infrastructure leasing program not really a cloud as we understand it this year's announcement changed all that so what was exactly announced first Green Lake Central the end user portal that was announced last year is now much more comprehensive and almost matches those of public clouds you can monitor the resource usage billing compliances order infrastructure upgrades and much more now the picture starts to look like what I was portraying a year ago this is a key component of the overall cloud experience obviously HP can't make the infrastructure completely invisible like with public clouds but they will do their best instead of infinite amount of different mix-and-match hardware configurations they have now narrowed it down to only 17 prepackaged configurations that come in three different sizes doing this they claim that they can have the infrastructure up and running at the customer site in 14 days or less all that is very impressive but what about the apps in the public cloud virtual machines and applications are easily spun up and down in no time if HP wants to deliver a true cloud experience app management is crucial look at that the perfect donkey bridge the second part of the announcement the return of HPE software in the form of HPD Esmeraude as an anchor point HPE positions Esmeraude to directly compete against VM Burton sue kubernetes portfolio and IBM Red Hat opened so the foundation of is morale is HPE Esmeralda container platform which is a rebranding of HP container birth form which is based on blue data kubernetes container technology a company that HP acquired back in 2008 team so yes as Murali Oh about containers HP Esmeraude data fabric on the other hand provides persistent container storage for Esmeraude this is the map our technology another company HP acquired late 2019 then HP installs Esmeraude in those prepackaged green lay configurations brings the appliances to you and you are ready to go provisioning applications from the Green Lake central now this is the cool part is Smurl can manage various different kinds of kubernetes clusters so you can move your containerized apps from the public cloud to Kolo to data centers to the edge and don't forget since this is cloud invoicing is only for what you actually use like antonioni reset there's a new cloud on the market but oh this this is just some awesome swag we got from HP I'm first to admit I did not expect HP to move this quickly it is clear to me by now that during antonioni wristwatch HP is fixed on one single target and the whole HP ship is sailing towards that destination without distractions even during this unprecedented times honestly at this very moment HP is blowing competition out of the water it will be very interesting to see how the market responds that was it from me this time if you liked the video hit like and if you want more of these subscribe until the next time
