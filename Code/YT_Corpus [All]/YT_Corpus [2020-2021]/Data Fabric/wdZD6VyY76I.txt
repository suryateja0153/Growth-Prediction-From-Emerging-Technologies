 um so we can move on to the next talk  that's uh that the third presentation   the final presentation is titled fair data  and secret gateway a research data alliance   adoption project and the presenter is rob quick  hello and let me share my screen here share and review let's see and let me know if you're seeing my  screen correctly yeah we can see it okay great   so somewhat inspired by the plenary talk this  morning i'm going to start off with a statement   here that i hope can lure everybody in um i think  it's a statement that actually everybody will   agree to but it's easy to get lost in a conference  like this where we're talking about gateways but   the statement i want to make is that the research  enabled by a gateway is much more important than   the gateway itself right so we all have got  jobs that relate to gateways so it's hard to   think about that but i think it's important to  realize that the research the gateway is a tool   to accomplish the research and the research is  really the goal here in research that allows   some decision making or some advancement in  wisdom so i wanted to start with that statement   because i think the gateways themselves are  somewhat transient they they come they go   the research though should be permanent and  one way to think about that is is by saying   that we want the the data and in fact even the  workflows to move towards the fair principles   and at this point everybody's probably heard  fair so many times that they're they're tired   of it and they know what the acronym means they  know findable accessible interoperable reusable   uh like the back of their hand um though they may  not have put much thought into what those words   mean beyond that and we'll talk a little bit about  that and in fact the project that we got funded by   the research data alliance to do was to look at a  specific gateway in this case the secret gateway   the science engineering application grid gateway  and a data infrastructure called rapid which is   the robust persistent identification of data and  i'll talk more about both of those a little bit   going forward but to see if we could take what are  the core fair principles at least the technical   portions of the the fair principles not so much  the social portions and apply them to a gateway   environment and what that really looks like so  to set some possible scenarios um we as i said   uh these gateways are tools for researchers the  researcher may be concerned um that the digital   objects they use or produce are governed by fair  principles they may have heard the buzzwords they   may have put it in their proposal they may  have agreed with what the word's meaning was   though didn't think so much about  what how to actually enable fairness   they may want their research to be reproducible  outside of the science gateway environment   as i said the gateways themselves are tools  that that will come and go over time and i   don't think we should expect that the gateway  will be a permanent place that the research will   live obviously the data lives outside of it the  publications live outside of that and in fact you   want your research to be reproducible even if the  science gateway is unavailable or possibly retired   at that point after some number of uh of years or  some amount of effort they may want to share the   steps or the workflow not just the results so they  may want to have some record of the workflow again   outside of the gateway to share with collaborators  or to put in a publication and they may want to   reuse that workflow with some amount of tweaks say  a new version of software comes out i just want   to drop in a new new version of software i don't  want to have to point all of my new data at it or   all of the intermediate steps just drop in a a new  piece of software so those are some scenarios but   first a reminder of what the fair principles  are again everybody knows the words um but   i don't know that so many people have written  read exactly what fair means and fair means uh   several things and and this slide produced by luis  benino shows the difference between the the green   is what can be uh implemented on a technical  side or through a through software whereas the   the black or blue whatever you may be seeing text  is more of what is a social contract right so   looking at f1 um you can technically assign  a globally unique identifier but there's some   social contract in saying that the systems that  record that identifier will be will be persistent   the same thing with f2 data can be described with  rich metadata and you can make a mechanism to do   that um however the rich portion of that is up  to the social contract and the researcher to or   the community to implement the other ones here  and again we centered on the green things the   things that were technically uh implementable  and i i don't want to go through all of this   because this is a relatively short presentation  but we focused on on those things in rapid   rapid the robust persistent identification of  data is basically a handle service or a pid   issuing service and that holds the metadata  resolves to the global system the same global   system that is used for dois and many of the  other data site users that it uses it also   so i'm going to move in secret here is basically  a a relatively general grid for science and   engineering applications is built on apache area  area vada and the adoption that we did here was   centered on small molecules and their fluorescent  properties i will show a bit of that if i have   time here because i want to show you how you take  what you've done in a gateway and actually find   out information about it externally so the rapid  testbed is a data cyber infrastructure it's a   something i've been funded by the nsf to to  work on it is entering year three right now   but basically it has the cyber infrastructure  for minting pids resolving them to give   metadata a data type registry so you know  the meaning of that data and what type   it's actually in and then a protocol and in this  case it's called the digital object interface   protocol that allows operations on digital objects  and it's basically the cyber infrastructure that   can it's a cyber infrastructure it's not the  only cyber infrastructure that does it but can   implement those technical components of the fair  principles that we looked at a few slides ago   and it leverages several things from rda  and then some existing software including a   a persistent identifier identifier kernel  information strawman profile basically a   profile of the metadata and the data types  the data type registry um and then it does   the group within rda called the data fabric  working group uh um theorized a bunch of this   we took it to the nsf got funded to work on it  and there's more for this at the link here below   and here's the idea of using pids pids  are cheap inexpensive easy to issue   and so what if we assigned pids on every step of  the workflow so the raw data um either in the file   or the raw data file are in other formats can  be assigned to pid for for each piece of that   the any preparation software or pre-preparation  can be given a pid the same with intermediate   data products these final analysis application of  software and the final data products they all get   persistent identifiers that are resolvable  with metadata about the workflow steps and so the the um simple example of the phosphorus  molecules are the fluorescent molecules sorry that   i mentioned earlier is shown in this tree it's  really um this is a very simple but basically   the workflow itself is given a pid so when  you hit submit a job it's given a pid for the   for a group of other pieces of metadata it's split  into input software and output pids and these have   various different things the input has the the  actual molecule in this case the coordinates   of each of the atoms in the molecule the  charges on those it also has some of the   things that are used in input for the in this case  gaussian software the software pid has the name   the version and other bits and pieces in fact  the software should probably be split into a   software and environmental pid because some of the  things we captured in the software pid are more   environmental type variables and then the output  id has the the error of the output and and the   log information so these could all be assigned  to pid these are all retrievable externally so   if two months later i want to go back and  see what version i'm writing the paper uh   two months after i did the  initial run i want to know uh   what the exact version of the pid i'm sorry the  exact version of the software i used i can do that and i will show that here real  quickly i have this set up so   this is the area vada and let me get it on  a bigger view here um the the workflow you   can see this is workflow i ran a few months ago  again i'm writing a paper today i have a um and   and for example if this gateway is gone i still  can get this pid i hate this pid i take it to   the handle.net which is the global  resolution system it sends me back to   to the rapid services um here you can see that  i have pids that are the uh the input data the   output data and the software data in this case i'm  looking for the version of the gaussian software   as i write the paper to make sure that it's  not a or that it's correct when i publish this   i can follow this pid down here to find the uh  app module version i can grab this from right   here again i have i don't need any access  to the gateway to do this um and i found my   version i can put that in my paper if i want  to change that version in the workflow i can   put in a pid that is you know a new  version or a different version or   something along those lines um and i think  i'm running out of time so i will get to my   conclusions here as soon as i can exit full  screen mode and get back to my presentation okay so we did this integration secret  is working with this it's available at   rapid.super.org if anybody wants to play  with it and it implements the issuing of   pids the gathering of metadata that is resolvable  externally and we it does use actually the digital   object interface protocol that i talked about  um and these uh um describe basically the   workflow components um you can use this to  recreate the entire computational workflow   without having any access to the gateway so if  if a researcher picks up your paper and says   i want to recreate this workflow but i don't  want to do it in the gateway environment they   can do that with by getting all of the metadata  information about the um about the uh workflow   that was used within the gateway again this uh oh  well not again but this directly impacts the uh mostly the f a and i parts of fair so the the  fey the r is is much has much more to do with   the reusable with the social contracts and  the metadata that is required to be gathered   um so it's much more of a a discipline our  community enforcing that to make those reusable   and nicely this is is extendable to other area  bottom-based gateways pretty easily in fact we   have a client so it can be moved to any gateway  not necessarily just areavata-based science   gateways and it leverages the rda community  and in fact was funded by the rda so we have   some future work document the client deployment  if there is documentation it needs to be tested   and maybe reworked to be more user-friendly  we did this on a very simple workflow we'll   have to do more complex workflows so something  like the common workflow language may need to be   integrated i showed it in the tree structure  it's probably more of a a dag structure a directed acyclic graph type  structure of what workflows really   work in we don't we wouldn't want people to have  to uh copy and paste through various different um   things like i showed through various  different web pages to get the information so   it needs some sort of workflow visualization that  is representable in in something a researcher   could read quickly without having to copy  and paste many pids to get the information   we're looking at the possibility of then  using the data to populate public repositories   in this case the fluorofluoroforbs.org because  this was fluorescent materials and the other ones   rapid itself right now is a in the test  bed service it was funded in the eager   award so it would have to operationalize to  be used in general it's a very stable and very   a very robust service running on jet stream right  now but it it would mean some operation optimus   upper operational uh components and then we have  some testing that's been done on the performance   of how many pids can be both resolved and issued  and and they're in the hundreds per second however   that comes from the developer of that service so  we would want to do some independent performance   analysis um before we uh release this widely  into the community um and with that i will   see if i can escape and stop sharing and take  questions hopefully uh uh subah that was in a   reasonable time i think so i think so i just went  one minute or that's fine um so thank you rob and   any questions for all then i see  one in chat let me quickly see   um so the question is have you implemented this  on any non apache airavata gateway to today so   no today we were only funded to do this on the one  gateway it was a a small short award rand ran from   january to june of this year um it funded  about about 20 of a person so this is the   only implementation we've done however the client  is independent of apache area vada and can be picked up from github reused again the the  instructions probably need to be gone through   but we would love someone to test it and see  if the instructions were reusable outside of   the people who have developed it but there's no  reason that it can't be done it just hasn't yet   any other questions for rob uh maybe i can ask one so um what was the level  of effort that was needed to change you know to   incorporate this into secret because secret  was like existing gateway right so what what   is it maybe you can give us an idea of the effort  involved so the uh i can give you a so for those   six month months it funded approximately 0.2 fte  um however that was the initial interaction and   i don't think that it would take that long again  because now we have the client again independent   um however you know doing it the first time takes  some some amount of effort and some integration   and i would see that future it would it  should not take nearly that much if it   takes that much then obviously we don't  have a product that can be reused widely
