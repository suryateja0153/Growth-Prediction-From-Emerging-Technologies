 hello and welcome to our session covering breakthrough insights across the life sciences value chain i'm kevin julian senior managing director in accenture's life sciences practice and later i'll be joined by my colleague mike stapleton who's the head of strategy for accenture's life sciences intent platform during this session we'll be talking about why creating breakthrough insights in life sciences is more important than ever and we'll share how intia accenture's life sciences platform powered by google is able to generate insights using leading-edge google technology during this session we'll spend most of the time illustrating examples of how insights are being generated by indian across the life sciences value chain from early research through pivotal clinical trials all the way through to delivering care to patients our industry is at a turning point shifting from small molecule large population strategic approaches to a more targeted scientific approach this shift is powered by what we at accenture call new science new science is a novel chemistry or biology in previously unsolved areas of need like cell and gene therapy often enabled by technology to deliver the therapy or to support the patient or sometimes maybe technology itself an app or other technology solution that intervenes in an effective way to improve the patient why the shift something had to change the old model simply was not supporting the needs of the market new science is attracting significantly more attention and investment and for good reason accenture research has determined that new science therapies are almost 50 percent more likely to be approved and greater than 50 of sales over the next several years are expected from new science this shift to new science brings the industry's dependence on technology to the fore increasingly industry depends on connecting data across the enterprise to generate insights into how therapies should be developed and brought to patients while this ambition is clear it's also clear that industry has yet to take the necessary actions needed to achieve their goal according to this idc study more than 50 percent of respondents did not have a clear path to connect share and analyze information across their organization this is where ntn comes in intian accenture's platform for the life sciences industry powered by google cloud enables insights and collaboration across the life sciences enterprise indian helps the industry generate breakthrough insights in three powerful ways through functionally oriented product suites that have been built in key areas of insight need drug research clinical trials pharmacovigilance and patient services with other use cases enabled by the ntn core platform and through additional use cases enabled by the intiant network our open ecosystem access solution through access to innovative specialty software services hardware content and other business partners the ntn network offers industry standard apis for pre-competitive functions that easily and quickly integrate into existing systems the ability to rapidly and flexibly deploy solutions and lower barrier to entry for new small and or niche software players all of this is made possible by the intune core platform powered by google cloud the core platform is a flexible and powerful data centric solution that connects a variety of data sources and makes insight generation possible how does it do that we start by using google's healthcare api to accelerate solution development and access third-party solutions with fully managed enterprise scale fire hl7 and dycom apis we use google's bigquery to analyze virtually unlimited amounts of data using standard sql at scale with zero operational overhead and automl provides non-expert users with access to pre-configured high-quality machine learning laws such as image detection translation and natural language process let's illustrate the power of india with a few examples to start my colleague mike stapleton will share some of the exciting insights our clients are generating with ntn research bye thank you kevin uh in the next section of our presentation we're going to bring the power of indian to life looking at three critical parts of the pharmaceutical value chain i'll start with research as kevin mentions i'll then go through clinical trials and then hand back to kevin we'll take it home connecting the value of research and development to the patient and the impact we get out on us and society in general so let's start with research and the fundamental challenges that face drug discovery scientists whether discard starting with a disease or starting with a target or starting with a biomarker discovery program or indeed repurposing existing research efforts in every single case drug discovery scientists are challenged bringing together a wide range of external data lots of historic hard to retrieve internal data assembling that data bringing it together in a format that can be easily managed easily visualized and decisions taken from that aggregated data consistently across the whole of drug discovery research that integration of data that thinking through a single query how easy it is to make a decision and how we can embed advanced tools artificial intelligence machine learning so that more informed decisions more informed predictions can be made to advance faster and in a more focused way to bring this to life i'm going to dig into one of these in a bit more detail and take a look at target discovery as a particular example to show the power of the ancient platform the key challenge here quite easy to state is that as an industry as a society we know more and more about human disease biology than we've ever have done and we continue to learn more and more on a daily basis through the advances in genomics to the connectivity and measurement of mobile devices that we all wear today we understand more and more about us as patients and how that information is connected to a therapeutic or a particular condition or a lifestyle that we have as individuals but even with that yet roughly 90 percent of candidate drugs fail in the clinic and a large number of those fail because in early stage drug discovery we still choose poor targets this has the obvious consequences to the industry long development times increased cost and quite significantly negative patient outcomes so if we had the opportunity as we do with a platform strategy like indian to address this key bottleneck this key area of pharmaceutical r d we would quite clearly have huge impact so why is it so difficult let's have a look at the operational consequences of drug discovery today very diverse skill sets are required to manually bring together that external and internal data integration of that data is extremely time consuming and often error probe key patterns key indications key predictions can only be made through machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities not by the human mind and so that's where the ancient solution comes in we can use the intiant solution to bring in those broad array of data sources we can aggregate those data sources filter pre-process and present the data in a much more meaningful and accessible way to a scientist through dashboards alerts predictions that allow scientists to better prioritize spread a guide and allow a portfolio activity of project teams to better manage assets and to move forward through the drug discovery process ultimately identifying novel targets and prioritizing targets which have a much higher probability of success further into pharmaceutical development let's take a look at a screenshot of how that would actually look and we see here a simple screenshot of a modern user interface from indians where we bring together that drill down of both therapy genome and target and that important interplay for a drug discovery scientist to make all of those connections through a simple interface to click to understand and to predict and obviously underneath all of this what is powering all of this what makes all of this possible is the incident beta fabric how we actually ingest those broad sources of data how we present those analytic viewpoints so that they are useful and guide in an intelligent way how is support as kevin mentioned the broad range of both chemical and biological research that now is just part of the armory for a pharmaceutical research scientist and how ultimately we action how do we actually inform partner companies other scientists colleagues across the globe to do something as a consequence of our insight through a very integrated request management capability so you can see at all levels here in drug discovery in pharmaceutical research how intian how the platform that kevin described addresses the key bottlenecks of bringing together the data aggregating the data and presenting it in an actionable unpredictable fashion success in research then takes us forward into pharmaceutical development so let's take a similar view of clinical trials and we start in a very similar way we start with the complexity of managing very large very diverse sets of data both internal and external to the pharmaceutical company hundreds of patients across dozens of sites globally being monitored and tested and the data from all of those patients in my new detail being brought together for future analysis prediction and regulatory filing hugely complex logistics that require a scale of computation to cleanse process and integrate that data across broad ranges of genetics genomics mobile data real world data so that ultimately we can create insights presenting that aggregated data in real time so that prediction can be made an analysis made to actually guide future trial design to inform uh conduct and commercial viability and to ultimately facilitate the filing of a new drug to the regulatory authorities let's take a look at clinical operations as one example here of how all this comes together the challenge being as i just stated bringing together those very large diverse formats and sources of data from numerous internal systems across a pharmaceutical company and significant sources of information from partner cros and this leads this challenge leads to inconsistency leads to delays in actually changing trial guidelines and ultimately increases costs and time so what makes operations in clinical difference as we ask the question in research a few moments ago again we still see similar patterns here integration of those disparate data sources is fundamental extremely time consuming and extremely expensive effective monitoring requires access to comprehensive and timely data and trends in clinical trials are complex and require incredibly complex interactive analyses so again we see how the intian solution the platform capabilities addressing these complexities and challenges facing clinical operations robust flexible data ingestion transformation that data in a way that makes the data usable and actionable actions to actually remediate issues in a much more timely fashion and visualizations through interactive dashboards predictive tools predictive simulation and analytics methods so again if we go to look at a screenshot here we can see how all this comes together a single viewpoint a clinical control tower if you like a visualization of the state of a particular trial or a set of trials how we monitor these through that dashboard how we see uh red amber and yellow uh indicators to easily flag activities that are on track or are not on track and require action how we can drill down into problematic areas regions countries sites and particular patient demographics and how those reports can easily be accessed by all leadership and scientists and medical practitioners collaborating globally on a particular program so with research and clinical we've seen how the common themes of data integration aggregation and presentation of that data our analysis and visualization and prediction of that data comes together through intimate and success then means we move to the patient and kevin will take it from here to explain how the value of rmd is then accelerated through greater patient engagement thanks mike and indeed even if one were to identify the best research target and successfully take it through clinical trials with all the capabilities that mike just described it wouldn't achieve its ultimate potential if we didn't solve for the needs of the patient we're targeting you ntm helps life sciences organizations get closer to the patient through our intim patient solution capabilities include integrating patient care which supports better treatment outcomes real world outcomes research creating greater understanding of clinical and economic value patient engagement support which improves initiation and compliance to prescribed treatments and precision medicine delivery which provides needle to needle support for new treatment programs all of those are important but let's focus on integrated patient care with india patient we're unable to allow physicians to prescribe digital support programs allowing patients to use devices and apps and all connected by an indian patient to manage their care we allow their care providers to monitor that care analyze and make recommendations to improve the care program all this importantly enables us to lower cost improve patient adherence and ultimately improve patient outcomes let's take a look at an example of our digital patient study solution which provides a tool for principal investigators to cohesively manage virtual stadium performance with ntn patient we can manage and track patient enrollment across sites easily configure and provision the devices that patients use track adherence to protocols and make early interventions that prevent patient dropout from the clinical trial and language insights learned through the trial to ultimately create an even better patient experience when that therapy is brought to market all of these capabilities together and the insights that are derived from them help our life sciences customers develop therapies that are built and delivered with the patient in mind those are the examples of insights that we've generated across the life sciences value chain using anti-life sciences accenture's life science platform powered by google if you have any questions our contact information is on this slide we'd be happy to answer them now it's for me to thank you for joining us to learn more about generating breakthrough insights across the life sciences value chain thank you
