 if you want to help your company survive the AI tsunami that's coming then you need them to get them to perform a 360 in the way the death currently thinking about their data small tweaks changes and adjustments are not going to cut it this is fundamental I'm talking about here is an AI revolution that starts with accepting that the way that large enterprises run their data at the moment is fundamentally broken how come your smart phone can recognize your face understand your speech and translate it into text and perform 101 other pieces of technical wizardry yet your IT department takes over two months to get a simple field added to the key report that you need every week well the first part to understand here is that all AI is built upon a data layer and within the modern enterprise outside of the tech giant this data layer is broken in fact it's non-existent large enterprises have literally thousands of separate siloed pieces of data these systems connect together in a spaghetti of different technologies there's little standardization around security and access common schemas and single entities and there's a kind of data culture that's just lacking in the modern enterprise and it's it's difficult and bureaucratic to get hold of the information that you need to perform a task in many ways this is not a new observation we're talking here about the data integration problem and the classic solution to this is the data Mart or data warehouse a big system that you big database that you go and grab all the data and perform an ETL process to get it into one single place but the data warehouse has several problems you have to define the schema up front it's really not very agile and as the this changes which it is continually doing the data warehouse is way too slow to keep up with that but fundamentally and this is where we begin to look at the the the pivot that the change in attitude that I'm talking about fundamentally you've got to be looking aiming at connecting all of the data assets within your company and a data warehouse even the very best ones within a large enterprise they're not even working at the same order of magnitude it's like 0.1% of the data within the company and there's not going to cut it not not for where things are going the newer kid on the block is is Hadoop and various kind of BigTable technologies and and it's a step forward all of these things are a step forward but the promise of the crystal clear waters of data lakes have not materialized for the enterprises they've blindly followed the tech giants into this technology and in most cases they've ended up with these kind of data swamps that's it they're not really doing very much and that's because they haven't tackled the fundamental problem the hard part of the problem which is conforming to schemas linking your entities and cleaning and making really extracting the knowledge out of there and also I've got news for you the the cool kids they've moved on they've moved on some time ago actually and they're all building knowledge graphs over the top of these data structure that they've got and knowledge graphs provides schema and meaning now as the knowledge graph moves up the height cycle we're going to see more and more about Enterprise knowledge graphs but my message here is that enterprises should not repeat the mistakes of the past and just blindly copy what Google and Facebook is doing now the knowledge graph is a genuine innovation for the first time data relationships are being made first-class citizens and the more time you spend thinking about it the more time you realize that data is all about relationships but the situation for an enterprise is different from the internet Giants the diversity of the data and the data culture that it exists within the enterprise or lack of data culture need to be tackled so the fundamental message in this series of talks is going to be about using the technology of knowledge graphs combined with decentralization and I shall go into decentralization in my next talk because I think it is through the combination of these two things creating a distributed enterprise knowledge graph that we can unlock the data revolution within the enterprise
