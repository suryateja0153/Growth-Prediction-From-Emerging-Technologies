 hi everyone welcome back to the container garden series where we're growing a vegetable garden in the seven by eleven space in containers we're partnering up with smart pots for the series and make sure that you watch the entire video because at the end I'm going to tell you how you could enter a giveaway for some smart pots now today's video is all about how to grow more vegetables in containers by growing vertically using trellises towers and rails so let's jump in first of all why is it important to grow vertically especially when you're growing in containers when you grow vertically such as growing vegetables on this trellis here you are maximizing the small space that you have taking up less ground space and creating more space for growing vegetables so I can grow a whole lot of vegetables up this trellis that I wouldn't have room to grow if they sprawled all over the ground so let me give an example here with this cucumber I have in this 15 gallon smart pots now a cucumber is a vining vegetable and if you let it grow it would just grow out here into my garden space and it wouldn't be very healthy it wouldn't have the airflow it needs and it wouldn't have the space it needs but growing on a trellis makes all the difference in the world what I'm gonna do is show you how to tie it up to the trellis so that you can maximize the space that you have and when you're tying things up to the trellis you can use string you can use twine I like to use this garden stretchy tie tape because it doesn't need any scissors just pull it apart and this space master cucumber is from the container garden seed collection it's a more compact variety and I'm already getting a lot of flowers on it which means cucumbers are not far behind so I'm just gonna take my little stretchy tie tape here and I'm gonna wrap one of them around the base of the cucumber plant tie it to the trellis to encourage it to grow up cucumbers grow really fast so I'll be checking on this every three to four days and then tying it up as it goes and growing vertically also has the added benefit of giving your plants more airflow which helps them be healthier and helps reduce disease there's lots of different things you can use for trellises this is a really fun DIY trellis I made out of tree branches look around your house see what you can find to make your own use garden stakes bamboo or purchase one in a garden center now the cool thing about cucumbers is they have these little tendrils which will eventually grab onto the trellis but usually cucumbers need a little bit of help to in training to grow up and look here's a little baby space master cucumber besides creating additional space to grow more vegetables growing vertically also gives you a tremendous visual appeal to your container garden so over here with this tree branch trellis I love this it's so whimsical it's so fun and I am gonna be trellising up the sugar baby watermelon which let me just show you down here is growing absolutely beautifully it's not quite long enough yet to tie up to the trellis but it probably will be within a couple of days so we'll be checking that out tying it up as it grows and it'll really make the space look absolutely beautiful now let me show you one other reason why it's a good idea to grow vertically so when you grow vertically not only are you creating more space to grow more vegetables making a really pretty visual appeal in your garden but you're also creating some space for some shade tolerant vegetables so as the space master cucumber grows up this tree branch teepee trellis it's going to create some shade underneath here and the smart pots where I can plant some lettuce seeds which will do a lot better if they're shaded in the heat of the summer and you're also keeping your vegetables up off the ground and hopefully away from the critters besides growing vertically on trellises I love to grow vertically in crate towers a lot of you been growing in strawberry crepe towers with me for years so we're gonna actually make a strawberry crate tower today now you don't have to grow just strawberries in a strawberry crepe tower any of the seeds from the container garden seed collection where compact vegetables would grow beautifully in crates but it's super easy to make crate towers these are just plastic crates you can pick up at Target Walmart pick up on Amazon and what we're gonna do is line them with the smart pots crate liners so that the soil doesn't fall through the holes so you can see there's a lot of growing space here and then we're gonna stack the crates three crates high so that you have a lot of growing space so first off we popped in the smart pots crate liner and we're gonna cut holes in the fabric to create some room for the plants so I've got a sharp pair of fabric scissors here and to cut the holes I'm just gonna snip and then create like an X pattern every other hole or so and this you can have a lot of fun with get creative cut as many holes as you would like or whatever vegetables you like it works great for herbs work great for greens you can even pop a little tomato in the top which we're gonna do or even a cucumber and pop a little trellis in so just experiment and have fun with it so I'm going to go ahead and cut the holes in these crates and we'll come back and show you and stuff one thing I really like about the crate liners is the fabric is super durable it's breathable it drains well really loves a good drainage that the towers and the crate liners provide so I've got holes cut in the crate liners in three of the crates here now what I did is I cut holes on three sides of the crate so you can see I've got holes and about every other section here and then on the sides with the larger section just cut one here and then a couple down at the bottom now I didn't cut holes in the back of the crate because this is going to be up against my deck rail but do whatever works for you for this space that you have so now what I'm going to do is just fold down the crate liners to get to the top level of the crate here because we're gonna stack these and that way the crate liner is not sticking out that's one thing about smart pots is you kind of just adjust it to your growing space and whatever you're using them for we're gonna stack them like so one more for the top and these are really fun you can stack it four or five high whatever you're comfortable with whatever you have space for now what I'm gonna do is unstack the crates here and we're gonna add soil and then add plants as we add the soil it's really a lot easier that way I'm gonna add just a couple inches of the good dirt potting mix to the bottom of the crate here and you do want to use a potting mix rather than using garden soil as we mentioned in the first video it's nice and light and fluffy it's not so heavy as garden soil and it's really gonna grow your plants nicely and good dirt really does the job so I pre moisten the good dirt in the bin here and I've added it to my crate and then what I'm gonna do is just add my strawberry plants and then add a little bit more soil as we add the plants these are the quinault variety they're an everbearing strawberry which will give us a couple of crops of strawberries a year so what I'm gonna do is just feed these strawberry plants actually going to knock off a little bit of the soil and then feed the strawberry plants through the holes starting with the bottom holes first when you're planting strawberries you want to leave the crown of the strawberry plant which is which is this little root structure at the bottom of the plant you want to leave that exposed so that they grow so they get so that they get the best growth just repeat the same steps for all the bottom holes of the crate so what I'm gonna do now is just add some more soil to bring it up to the level of where I have my next holes cut in the crate liners so I've added a few more inches of soil to the crate liners now we're gonna pop in a couple more strawberry plants right through the front here we're going to do that all the way around then we're leaving the crown of the strawberry exposed here that's how it's gonna grow the best it looks like it's time to add some more soil again I kind of tamp it down as we go pushing it into the corners as well to make sure we get plenty of coverage so I've added more soil now we're up to the top level of the crate here we're gonna pop a couple strawberries in the front here and then we'll just repeat the same process with the second and third crates and again make it work for the vegetable that you're growing in the space that you have is to be so beautiful filled with greens kale and it would just kind of spill down and give you a lot of extra vegetables in your containers let's just top this crate off of soil I'm gonna try and get it as full as I can with soil because the soil will settle over time and that way doesn't leave the roots of these strawberry plants exposed I'm gonna add drip irrigation to each one of the crates so the plants get good consistent even watering but before I do that I'm going to fertilize them with some liquid organic fertilizer the vermis Terra worm tea and the good dirt plant food you have the strawberry is a nice good burst of growth to give them started here I cannot wait to eat these fresh juicy strawberries and if you decide to grow strawberries you're gonna love having strawberries in your containers too now I'm gonna install the quarter inch drip irrigation tubing this has the drip emitters already built in and you can go back and watch my video on how to install drip irrigation and containers for all the details but I especially like to use drip irrigation when I'm growing in towers because that way every level of the tower gets the consistent water that it needs and I'm installing my hose here in a circle pattern I'm just going to wind around the crate securing it into place with the landscape staples and I want to try and get the drip emitters as close to the plants as I can again that way they're getting consistent watering and I want to finish with the end of the hose being near the back of the crate because this way I can connect it to my container drip irrigation I'm just gonna snip a hole in the corner of the crate liner here that way I can feed the drip irrigation through to connect the crates together I've got all three my crates planted now it's time to stack up the towers I've got my bottom one here and I'm gonna put the middle one on top of that and notice the drip irrigation hoses are on the same back corner here so I've got two crates I'm gonna add the third crate on top and we are gonna be planting on the top of the third crate in just a moment so let me just show you real quick how I'm going to connect the drip irrigation the crates together I have my little drip emitter hose sticking out here in the corner and I'm going to connect it using this little elbow barbed connector and a quarter inch supply line that has no drip emitters attached to it so first we're gonna soften up the hose with a lighter put one end of the elbow connector to this hose and then attach my supply line with no drip emitters to the other end of the elbow connector this will lead down into the next crate and carry the water down there okay so we got that pushed in and then we're gonna connect it here to the drip emitter hose coming out of the second crate and this time we're going to use a t barbed connector because we need these three connection points and let me show you what I mean now we're going to connect the middle crate in the bottom crate with one more supply line and right here we'll hook another supply line and connect it up with our container drip irrigation system and I ran out of strawberries for the top so what I decided to do was pop in a couple the Tiny Tim Tomatoes these are dwarf Tomatoes from the container garden seed collection they just grow to about one to two feet tall so I'm just gonna pop two in the top here they'll be perfect when you're deciding where to put your Tower you want to put in a spot that's not going to shade out the rest of your plants I think I'm gonna drag it right over to that corner now besides trellises and towers another great way to create more space in your container garden is by utilizing your deck rails I mean this is a blank canvas and you definitely don't want to waste this space and I'm using it to grow more veggies I'm actually gonna pop some strawberries and kale in here with the wall saddle planters these are also made by smart pots and I think they are really cool they just fit right over your deck railing they have pockets on either sides that you can plant in I've got three lined up here already installed the drip irrigation now here I'm just popping in some strawberries I'm transplanting from another area of my garden it's gonna look so pretty with these strawberries hanging over the wall Saddles just pop them in leave the Crown's out and they got watered with a drip irrigation and here I've got a couple kale plants I'm gonna pop in this is red Russian kale so so beautiful kale is such a great heat tolerant plant so it's gonna really hold up well to the summer heat you could even plant like a cucumber that will kind of spill down and that would look really pretty too some flowers would also be really really pretty we'll plant this last one up with another strawberry plant there are so many ways to create more garden space by growing vertically I can't wait to hear what you learn from this video I want to thank smart pots for partnering with on this series and together
