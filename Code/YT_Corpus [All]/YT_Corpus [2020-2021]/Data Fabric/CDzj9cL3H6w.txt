 (upbeat music) RPA and AI are better together. When paired, they can read, write, listen and make decisions, to work effectively - but apart, robots can only automate so much, and AI becomes hard to apply. AI needs RPA as the delivery mechanism, to solve real-world problems, and RPA needs intelligence, for its robots to learn new skills, like visual understanding, or process discovery, or understanding natural language. At UiPath we're developing a solution to pair RPA with AI, that we're calling our AI Fabric. UiPath's AI Fabric is the connective tissue between these two worlds, delivering end-to-end AI skill creation and deployment, within the UiPath Enterprise RPA platform. AI Fabric works by first giving you the option to either build your own AI skills, or select pre-trained skills from UiPath, or over 60+ AI technology partners. AI Fabric will allow you to deploy  and manage your AI skills then drag and drop them right into  your RPA workflow via UiPath Studio. Finally, AI Fabric will close the data feedback loop, giving information back to your AI skills, to continuously improve the model. With AI Fabric, RPA and AI will finally come together, and help you take the next step on your automation first journey. (upbeat music)
