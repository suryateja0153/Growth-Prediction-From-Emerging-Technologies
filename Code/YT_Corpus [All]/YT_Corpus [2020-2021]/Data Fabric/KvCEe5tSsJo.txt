 hello my name is Ammar I'm here to talk about SAS data protection today today the cloud adoption is actually steadily on the rise for the past few years and this is the world where you can consume anything as a service and pay only for what you actually use and I know that's unlike the traditional data center model in the same context software as a service is another service that is provided by cloud service providers and the SAS adoption in consumption has been on the rise for the last few years and very recently the spending of SAS consumption has crossed 100 billion dollars and the top most consumed services SAS services are Microsoft Office 365 and Salesforce Microsoft Office 365 provides a messaging and collaboration platform to improve end-user productivity and the most important application is consumed and office 365 are exchange online onedrive for business sharepoint online groups and teams similarly sales forces the void most widely used CRM application across the globe that organizations used to drive their business and the important mission-critical data is actually stored in many different clouds like sales cloud service cloud forest comm marketing cloud and community cloud and so on data is the digital currency in today's world and the loss of data could actually result in economic loss for organizations and what induces data loss fundamentally the most recent industry research actually claims that 47 percent of the data loss was actually induced by end user actions that being said act as accidental deletions are probably intentional unintentional and 17 percent of data loss was actually because of insider threat and malicious intent and 13 percent wear off the data losses were due to ransomware attack and please note that it is actually growing year-over-year in the cloud world you know customer you as a customer are the one who is responsible for your data there are many different options that your cloud service provider may provide you to recover data but they may not be in doing at the same time they are not comprehensive and they are not very easy to use to it is very important for you to actually have a data protection solution for your mission-critical data stored and services like office 365 and Salesforce native SAS backup was is born in the cloud application built to protect mission-critical data that is actually stored in office 365 and Salesforce and it is built with best-in-class security and also enables you to provide a multi-tier SLA in terms of our peers to your customers inside your organization and also net UPS as backup was actually built with a philosophy in mind to make sure that our customers do not require to actually build complex competency in managing and administering this data protection application that being said the UI is so simple and intuitive to use that it is very consistent the UI is consistent across any applications that you're configuring for data protection be it Exchange Online or onedrive for business SharePoint groups and teams or even Salesforce for that matter this is a UI for any action there is no it does not require more than click three clicks per configuration that's the most important point for you to note and also native SAS back up actually comes with an all-inclusive law licensing that provides you unlimited storage retention capabilities and also backups and you can actually also provide you the flexibility to be able to store data at a storage endpoint of your choice either at the Aneta provided AWS s3 bucket or an azure blob storage you can also consume our service by actually bringing your own storage that being said you have still had the choice of actly storing the data in your AWS bucket or an azure blob or should there be a compliance concern that concerns you too and requires you to bring the data which is the protected data back to your unpromising you could do so by actually leveraging our storage grid web-scale law you know ma appliance and also Netta provides you the ability to take your data anytime with you with the export configuration that being said you can export your mailboxes to a PST file or probably you know your onedrive and SharePoint data and yours and your Salesforce data and export at any point time and also for if there are any compliance reasons why you need to act like I know delete a data from the backup because say for example employee left the organization you do not want actually retain his mailbox anymore you're free to do so with our purging capability and I am sure at this point of time you're very excited about an in-app size backup and I would strongly encourage you to go ahead and start a free trial and forth by filling up a simple form in this webpage and we provide you a 30-day trial good luck with your trial and see you in your service
