 Great I'm going to go ahead and get us started. Good morning, I am Kelly Born   Executive Director of the Cyber Policy Center, here at Stanford University and we are glad to   be today hosting a conversation about platform  scale and in particular the challenges that the   monopoly position of social media companies hold  and pose for our global information ecosystems   and i'm glad to be joined today by a great group  of discussants we will have first Frank Fukuyama   who is the director of Stanford Center on  Democracy Development and the Rule of Law he   is a leader here at the Cyber Policy Center's  Program on Democracy and the Internet, Director   of the stanford masters in international policy  and the leader of the stanford working group on   platform policy which we are hearing i'm sorry  on platform scale which we are hearing from today   we'll also be joined by Ashish Goel who is a  professor of management science and engineering   here at Stanford and by courtesy of computer  science by Barak Richmond Professor of Law   and business administration at Duke University who  focuses on antitrust amongst many other things as   well as by Roberta Katz and Marietje Schaake. Roberta Katz  is from the center for the advanced study and   behavioral science. Marietje is a policy director  the international policy here at the cyber policy   center who uh they are both also members of the  stanford working group on platform scale and   may have some remarks and then from there we  will be turning it over to Luigi Zingales who   is a professor of finance at the university of  chicago's booth school of business and a co-host   of the podcast capital isn't and then finally by  Dick Costolo who was the CEO of Twitter from 2010   to 2015 the founder and ceo of multiple startups  and now a managing partner at 01 advisors which   works with startup ceos and there is perhaps no  one in the world as qualified as dick to reflect   on the issues at hand quick before turning it  over to many of these panelists for those who   are not familiar with the cyber policy center  all of our research and teaching focuses on   improving the governance of digital technologies  when it comes to questions of geopolitics security   and democracy we're home to  about a half dozen programs   and all of our work is intended to inform the  policy agendas for governments tech companies   uh civil society and academia when again it comes  to these questions of how best to govern digital   technologies we host all of these webinars every  Wednesday every other Wednesday at 10 am pst   and for today's webinar just for a bit  of background I think as many here know   in early october democratic members of the  house judiciary subcommittee on antitrust   published a more than 400 page report the result  of 16 months of investigation exploring whether   the four biggest tech giants amazon apple facebook  and google engage in a range of anti-trust and   anti-competitive behavior together with microsoft  which has of course had its own anti-trust   challenges and battles in the past these companies  now represent more than 20 percent of u.s GDP   they have also joined the ranks of the top 10  lobbying groups in the united states which of   course further complicates their regulation but  there are many reasons both economic and perhaps   more importantly social and democratic  that people are concerned about the tech   company's monopoly positions and a whole range  of solutions to address their impact on society   and the information ecosystem have been proposed  everything from improved content moderation to   fact checking news and digital literacy trainings  uh amendments to cda 230 and the liability that   platforms face for what they host and a whole lot  more today's conversation is really going to focus   on uh ways to make the platforms more competitive  and many of the anti-trust challenges that we've   been talking about here so i want to start uh  frank first and turn it over to you and then   have you turn it over to colleagues after that  we will save 20 or 30 minutes at the end for q a   as if folks can go ahead and enter their questions  in the chat box i will go ahead and moderate that   there is a function that will allow you to  upvote questions so if there are questions   that are of particular interest please go  ahead and upload those and we will get to them   about 20 minutes to the hour all right  thank you and frank i'll turn it over to you   okay thanks very much kelly so let's uh put the  slides up uh this is a report of the working group   on platform scale here at stanford next slide uh  we put the uh link to the actual working group   paper uh in the chat box and you should feel  free to download it it's part of the program   on democracy and the internet that has been  uh sponsored very supportively by the knight   foundation next slide please so these are the  members of our uh group there's one political   scientist one a former european uh politic or  parliamentarian three uh lawyers with antitrust   backgrounds we actually had a computer scientist  we also had a couple of economists that had to   leave our group early but made important uh  contributions to the discussion uh next slide   there's been a lot of work as kelly indicated on  uh antitrust in recent uh months there's a number   of academic centers the Stigler center that Luigi  runs the Berkman center at Harvard Thurman Arnold   Project at Yale and then various other initiatives  as well as all of the legislative and regulatory   initiatives that have been undertaken which  you've been reading about from day to day in   the newspapers when we began this group the title  was actually the stanford anti-trust working group   but as we began to discuss the issues underlying  uh antitrust we began to realize that antitrust is   too narrow a framing of what the real issue  was uh it restricted us to a certain class   of economic problems but in fact the issue  was much larger than that next slide please i think that you can put the harms that people  have pointed to of these large platforms into   three categories antitrust law is really um  suited to dealing with economic harms like   exclusionary policies the use of monopoly  power to stifle competition and innovation   uh and the like there's a separate category  of social harms that have a lot to do with   the violations of privacy uh and the  effects on social relationships that   platform use involves but in our group we decided  that we would focus on the political harms there's a lot of work being done in terms of  the you know narrowly defined economic harms   that antitrust law deals with and we didn't feel  that you know i mean there are literally thousands   of lawyers working full-time on this issue as  we speak and our contributions in this area   were going to be limited but the political harms i  think are the things that bother many stakeholders   and people have been talking since 2016 about  things like filter bubbles targeted advertising   fake news conspiracy theories as deleterious to  democracy but i don't think they've been focused   adequately on the question of scale because  that's really what is problematic i think in our   world today in our view the current  situation with the large platforms google   facebook and twitter is comparable to the  situation that existed in the 50s and 60s   with broadcast television when there were only  three major networks that heavily shaped political   uh discourse in the united states at that time  uh the government saw fit to regulate what the   what the networks could carry uh through  something called the fairness doctrine which   the supreme court at the time uh decided was  constitutional and consistent with the first   amendment but this was very controversial it was  rescinded by the f uh fcc in 1987 and i think   today uh it's inconceivable that in our polarized  world we could have something like an agreed-upon   fairness doctrine as a result what's happened is  that many civil society groups have pushed the   platforms to self-regulate to curate news as  if their media companies responsible for the   quality of political discourse we've seen this  as we speak this week with twitter labeling   tweets of our president as disputed factually  disputed when he talks about electoral fraud   and in our view um this kind of curation by the  platforms by these big private companies is not   a sustainable uh solution to the problem we may  like what Jack Dorsey is doing with regard to   president trump but it's that underlying power  that we regard as a kind of loaded weapon it's   like a gun that's sitting on the table and  we can't rely on the good intentions of the   person sitting opposite us on the table to use  that to not use that gun on us because in the   future it may be turned that way if we could  get the next slide uh i think that we need to   really be concerned with the things  that are specific to large-scale   platforms and that is their power to amplify or  to diminish certain political voices based on a   business model that encourages uh clicks and  virality uh and in a process that is actually   completely non-transparent it's run by  artificial intelligence algorithms that   modify themselves and the content that is served  up to people is something that you know they don't   really understand the logic behind and i think  for our democracy it creates a lot of problems   with regard to the ability to deliberate for basic  social cohesion has contributed to polarization   and all of the ills that many people have referred  to so with that i'll turn it over to uh to barack thanks frank very much i'll say at the outset that  it's been a real honor to be part of this group   and it's also an honor to hear from dick and luigi  on our work so uh bearing in mind that i want to   make sure they have enough time i'll try to be  very brief um so i think that our contribution   could be summarized you might say in three  distinct parts number one uh in approaching uh   trying to understand what kind of dangers  the large platform like facebook and google   editor and amazon post our first observation  our first contribution is that as what frank   said we recognize that the harms they  pose are not just economic but in fact   maybe their greatest harms are political  nature the second contribution is that   we didn't just want to look at any  trust harms we also wanted to look at   rather any remedies we also wanted to look at a  variety of other remedies and that's what i'll   talk about and our third contribution is that  the recommendation that we have is more of a   technological one and that's what asis will talk  about so a next slide i'm going to talk about   four alternative options uh only one of them being  any trust uh remedies um and we're gonna describe   why we felt that each of these remedies some of  which have been talked about more than others   don't really address the core political problems  that frank described which as we mentioned   um are we think um only under appreciated  perhaps the greatest uh dangers of all um   so in examining how end trust law could  alleviate the political threats uh and   the the dominance that these platforms have over  communication um we look at the possible anchor   power and just actions and there are some viable  actions um the platform at the platform do uh   uh have allegedly engaged in certain abuses of  their dominance uh they certainly have acquired   and merged with nascent competitors which  might have enshrined their dominance they   have engaged in certain information acquisition  practices that could be anti-competitive and   each of these categories of conduct might amount  to a viable any trust claim and they all might be   uh attractive things to pursue in the sense that  they might limit uh certain economic harm and   maybe they even would limit the kind of expanse  of political dominance that the platforms have um   but none of them really address the core political  concerns they might mitigate certain economic   harms but they would not really dilute the kind  of political power uh that these platforms have um   and in that sense although we're enthusiastic  about a lot of the angels work that's happening   we really do not think that relying on the sherman  act alone would mitigate the core core concerns we   have next slide so in response to that observation  i don't think we're the only ones to say that   traditional nhs law might be limited in addressing  these foundational concerns about dominance   some people have said well maybe that means we  should just reform any trust law we should have   anxious law uh expand its concern not just  for consumer welfare not just for economic   concerns but also to really address um uh  underlying concerns about medical power   and you there are some who associate  themselves with what's called the   neo brandeis and antitrust movement that have  proposed this um it would perhaps allow even uh   actions that might reduce consumer welfare it  might allow actions that will reduce political   power and overall economic power that the  platforms have but we're really worried about   reforming any trust law in this way we think that  um incorporating additional uh and in commensurate   values into any trust law would put courts and  agencies in a really difficult spot it would be   very difficult to police good antitrust law it  would put agencies and judges in a position of   allocating welfare often in a negative some  relationship it would be very very hard to curtail   an expanded multi-valued antitrust law to  do the kind of things that we really want   any trust law to do so we're very skeptical of  this option um no go ahead next slide the third   possibility that we've talked about and others  have proposed is perhaps requiring the platform   to make their data sources available and  interoperable with competing platforms   or alternatively allowing individual users to  take their data from one platform to another   this would alleviate lock-in it would be easier  for example to instead of relying on everyone to   be on Facebook it might make it easier to move  to an alternative platform or might allow an   alternative platform to capitalize upon the data  that these large platforms like facebook have um   we think this offers a lot of potential but  we think that the technological difficulties   have really been underestimated it really  each platform has different character um   different data structure uh the possibility  of moving meaningful data the metadata   the data that facebook generates uh and google  generates in order to understand how to market   how to sell valuable advertising it's not clear  that that data would be movable um and we also   are concerned that as a general matter allowing  data to be more portable and more interoperable   raises other concerns for example the data is  has greater accessibility to others and that also   threatens concerns surrounding privacy i will say  that our middleware proposal does build upon some   idea that underlies the data interoperability  suggestions um but we think as a general remedy   uh uh pursuing uh initiatives with the required  data portability interoperability would be both   uninfeasible and also problematic on other  fronts next slide um our our last uh the last   of the options that i'll be talking about that we  discussed uh and explored uh is enhancing privacy   protections and the basic idea behind this is  that the source of the platform data not just   iIm sorry to source the platform's power not just  the economic power but especially political power   really relies on gathering uh amassing enormous  uh some enormous amount of personal data and the   possibility that if we limit the acquisition and  use of this data maybe we can limit their economic   comparative advantage and maybe it can mitigate a  lot of the political dangers that we're concerned   about they would have less of an ability  to control information flows and to exploit   individual vulnerabilities from lack of privacy  um i mean remedies also are attractive there's a   lot of reasons to do it both for economic and  political concerns or frankly are reasons to   enhance privacy protections for private privacy  to take itself um but many of these persons by the   dominant platforms have already taken the nominal  platforms already have enormous uh uh collections   of personal data um and it would be very difficult  to institute privacy protections that would limit   their the the economic and political power  they have already amassed um it also we also   are concerned that instituting regulations uh  that uh have certain privacy protocols might   be a source of entry errors as well and might  undesirably sustain the comparative advantage the   current dominance that the platforms have um so we  think that this is attractive but we don't again   think that privacy protections would really  get at the underlying source of political power   um and would not uh alleviate the kind of control  that the current platforms have so with those   policy objectives or those alternative remedies  um being explored and are finding shortcomings   with each of them although there's a lot of about  this attractive in each as well um we arrived at a   more technologically oriented solution and that's  the middleware and i'll pass this over to ashish i so before we launch into our middleware approach  there's some points which i would like to make   our goal was to come up with a technical solution  which we think would actually address the problem   so it has to be big enough in scope to actually  address the problem but at the same time we   were also mindful that this these solutions  where possible should not uh disintermediate   existing platforms or should not severely enter  their existing business model to the point that   we might risk disrupting the entire tech  innovation ecosystem and also i would like   to clarify that we don't think that middleware is  the only solution we believe that this would work   in conjunction with other things and these are  very preliminary ideas and much hard work remains   to be done next slide please so i'll start with a  slide where by jack dorsey and you'll notice that   even the tech platform leaders are in favor of  enabling people to choose their own algorithms   to rank the content right we're going to go  one level further than this in our proposal   uh like uh jack says uh to be that open i think  would be pretty incredible we think it'll be nicer   to be even more open and again that's something  that we will outline in our talk going forward so how does middleware work and end user can  choose among a variety of middleware providers   right so i might choose aclu someone that else  might choose american enterprise institute   and these middleware providers will tag  political content with labels such as misleading   nissa additional context etc  and then they'll send their tax   directly to the platform they can also  provide ranking algorithms to be used   by the tech platforms or relevant scores for  specific pieces of content and the platform   then applies these filters and ranking algorithms  alter the results of any query made by the user   so what's really sitting between in the middle  and the reason we use that a middleware between   the user and the platform is not a piece of  software but rather the editorial judgment   of the middleware provider so you can think of  middleware as an editorial middleware if you want so this is all the relationship between  a middleware and a platform looks like   in what we are imagining so imagine there  being a wall like think of it as a chinese wall   and the user comes to a search or social platform  issues a query maybe just wants to sort of   uh browse on a web page and there's a bunch of  content being served by the platform and some   of this is content of a of a political nature and  for that content the platform will use middleware   provided filters and re-ranking criteria before  it sends the results back to the user and   we're going to illustrate this using some examples  so for example you can imagine on facebook   this is how the user would choose a middleware  there would be a preference pane where the user   can go and choose the middleware service that they  want to use for fact checking maybe for privacy   and i i want to point out that while our  primary focus here is on political content   in fact we believe that middleweight can also  be used effectively for privacy by for example   choosing a very detailed menu of privacy options  on facebook so this would be like one component   of our idea that the user should choose their own  middleware service provider right and they should   be done in some kind of like an opt-out fashion  where the platform cannot be its own default then we also have some examples of what  this would look like to the end user   when they're using the platform so for example  here's a tweet and if i have chosen aclu as my   middleware provider then instead of saying this  tweet is considered hate speech by twitter you   will see a tag saying this tweet is considered  hate speech by the aclu this tweet has been   carefully chosen to not be a hate speech tweet  so we didn't want to actually show an actual   hate speech tweet so i apologize to whoever made  the tweet this tweet is actually perfectly fine   so this is one instantiation of how  middleware would impact what users see here's another instantiation so for example  when you search for news results on google   you could see results based ranked upon the  preferred news sources that the user has   specified and the user has specified these  preferred new sources not by going and   choosing each new source individually because  that would be very hard for the user but by   choosing a middleware provider which is then  serving these recommendations to the platform   you can also imagine someone in the medical  profession using a middleware company that   prioritizes healthcare related news and so we have  seen for example how a service like this could   this idea could apply to things like twitter  things like google things like facebook and once again while our focus  has been on political content   in fact we believe that  this would also help expand   user control over commercial content so you  can imagine for example a middleware provider to affect how search results on Amazon  get ranked for commercial content for   example they might want to prioritize  products made in the united states so some of the advantages of middleware  is that really dilutes the control   of dominant platforms so instead of so platforms  still retain much of the core functionality right   and there's no one coming between the platform  and the user but really reduces the power of   the platform's control information and in fact in  his uh testimony uh mark zuckerberg mentioned that   they don't actually want to be to have editorial  control and so if tech platforms don't want to   have actual control then they should be willing  to see this editorial control to a third party   middleware like it also reduces the ability of  third parties to manipulate content disseminated   on the platforms so for example one of the things  that frank alluded to at the beginning was that   one big harm that's being caused is not just  because these platforms are behaving in some uh   with intention in some way but third parties are  trying to manipulate what con what content people   see and the fact that tech companies actually  maximize clicks as opposed to utility uh leads   to a lot of the manipulations and so by having  a middleware provider which is uh not trying   to maximize clicks this will reduce the ability of  third parties to manipulate content the additional   benefits but in the interest of time i feel  like uh instead of just having on the benefits   we should also focus on some of the challenges  and the work ahead and barack will take over terrific please so yeah yeah this is this is an  idea that really is very preliminary um there's   a lot more of the thinking needs to be done and  what we did uh in our report at describing what   we think middleware could really do we then uh  started listing what the next set of decisions   would be um and we had identified three in  particular uh number one uh is as he's identified   the kind of interplay that middleware um and the  platforms would have with each other and a lot of   that probably needs to be spelled out more um to  some degree there certainly needs to be a certain   requirements to make sure that middleware really  does give users meaningful uh decisions um the   between the platforms in the middleware could  vary and could vary based on what the user wants   um but the uh but that power balance really has  to be worked out um and also we think that there   is a certain minimal regulator would have to  impose on middleware products so these are things   from the regulatory and you might say from  the statutory perspective that still need to   be worked out um we also need to think more  about how to make middleware an attractive   financial model for we have to make sure that  middleware providers are financially incentivized   to offer middleware products and it's possible  that uh middleware will help identify individuals   for whom advertisers um i would want to target  and maybe the addition of a middleware layer would   create additional revenue um that the middleware  provider and the platform uh could share   but alternatively uh we know where providers could  use user fees or sell advertising directly this is   something also that would need to be worked  out because it's really critical uh to have   this technological solution be sustainable and  encouraged by um by market opportunity and finally   there are a lot of technical technical issues that  really need to be worked out um the middleware   needs to access different kinds of platform  content um and needs to accommodate to different   technical architectures so there will have to  be a lot of coordination a lot of work together that middleware providers and  platforms will have to work out   so this is our last slide um in conclusion uh  we think we are identifying a different category   uh of harms from others uh and this is  a category of political harms we think   really need a lot more attention um and we  also consider multiple approaches we are not   focused only on traditional nhs concerns and  we're also not focused on traditional antitrust   remedies we are looking at all sorts of  a variety of other regulatory remedies   um and ultimately uh the uh the main proposal  we have is a technological middleware we   wear editorial power away from a small number  of technological platforms and hand it over now   into a competitive market but also competitive  market that's responsive to users preferences   and we think that this will really address  not only our demands that users have but also   will address the core problem of political  dominance um that has driven our analysis great thank you all so much so with that we are  getting some great questions please keep them   coming but before turning to those would love uh  luigi to turn to you for comments and responses   here and then dick over to you okay can you hear  me so thank you very much uh it's a pleasure to   comment uh on this phenomenal contribution uh and  i have to say i'm not the best discusser because   i agree with not only the approach but much of the  conclusion that this report is is uh proposing so   i i'm not uh the most critical discussion uh  that you can have and what is funny is that uh   both francis and i come from very different  background and uh we arrived to a very similar   conclusion and i think that sometimes i i love the  expression by prime minister former prime minister   clemenceau that paraphrasing is a famous sentence  anti-trust is too serious a matter to let it run   by anti-trust experts i think that the problem is  too big and they often uh people that are within   the field and i'm certainly not within the field  look only at uh the tree and not the forest and   and the beautiful thing about this report is that  it really looks at the forest and i think that the   forest is that the problem is in the business  model of the digital platform so um hate speech   biases diffusion of information that is fake etc  is not a bug of the system is a feature of the   system there is a strong incentive for all these  platforms to push the most titillating incredible   uh information in order to get attention in order  to get uh people to spend time on it in order to   get more visibility more data more profits so  um the proposal that they make is is very clever   and is trying to say let's create a technological  uh intermediary that will solve all the problems   i i like the idea because i share uh this group  diffidence with any intervention in term of uh   regulation of freedom of speech or giving power  to censorship to the platform i think that   the discussion that uh the furnace directories was  uh possible in a country in the 1970s when there   was more homogeneity of views today the world  is so polarized that is impossible to maintain   so and and they um sympathetic to this now i of  course i have some question first of all uh much   of the report focuses on facebook and twitter uh  but i am also very concerned nobody wants to talk   about this but also very concerned about google uh  and why is because there is research nobody wants   to study this research i don't know why but there  is this search that suggests that simply ranking   news in different ways uh induces people to vote  in a different way and we're not even saying   faking news it's just ranking them differently so  if i put uh hunter biden first uh people are gonna   vote for trump and if i put uh stormy daniel  first uh people are gonna vote for biden i'm   exaggerating this is not the experiment just you  you get a sense and um how do you fix this problem   i think that that's uh more difficult um i thought  about it maybe this is the idea of the middle way   i thought about uh uh a kind of unbundling of  the last mile this shows my background i spent   some time in telecommunication so facing a natural  monopoly so for example in italy the there is only   one fixed line that goes to every house and so  that's at the moment a natural monopoly to create   competition what they did is they unbundled  the last mile so forcing the the monopolies   provider to provide the last mile at a competitive  price to a number of potential uh providers and   the analogies here with google is uh maybe what we  should do is there is an enormous natural monopoly   in search because there are uh returns to scale  and this returns to scales are emphasized the more   people uh search so from an efficient point  of view we don't want to break this apart   however after the search is done how you present  this search to your customers whether you put 10   top ad first or not whether you rank for certain  news or not that could be done by a middleware   uh at the bottom uh of course  you need to force google to share   the search result at the predetermined price to  the various providers and this is the part that   i have not seen very clear and clearly in  the report but i think is the crucial part is   what kind of regulation we need to uh get  this middleware solution implementable because   let me tell you that at least in social  media a middleware company did exist   was called power ventures and what was doing was  reaching all the social media they were using   um and getting data from there presenting  to the final user in the way they wanted and   then when they wanted to pass their pictures  they posted the picture on power venture and   power venture automatically would post it on  facebook instagram pinterest whatever you want   now that company is no more why because facebook  sue the hell out of them and sue the hell out of   them establishing the following principle i'm not  a lawyer but as a citizen i find this outrageous   that if i give kelly my login and password for  my facebook account and she with my authorization   enters into my facebook account with my login and  my password and gets some data she commits hacking   which is a federal crime she can go to jail  okay so under this uh world i think would be   inconceivable that any middleware company were  to operate so we need to think about how we go   about undoing the effect this is now a i think  a district level judge opinion so it does not   have the power the supreme court decision but the  supreme court will reject it to look at it so i   think it's very difficult to overturn we will need  to have some massive uh political movement to do   it and then the question is for you francis given  you are the political scientists in the group   where do we get the political will to do that  one of the interesting facts of the stereo report   was saying that the problem regulating  the political the the digital platforms   is that they're also very politically influential  and so i i think the challenge is how to pass   some serious regulation at the time where the  political demand is not there thank you luigi   some great points and we have a number of great  questions coming up too but first dick i'm really   curious to hear your reactions to this proposal  sure um as ashish knows uh from working with me   i'm a callous pragmatist so i'll try to start off  with my positive idealistic views and then and   then revert to the norm of my callous pragmatism  toward the end um so first of all um and to the   point that was just made um mark and jack and  others are telling the truth when they when they   announce that they don't want the responsibility  for editorial control it's tremendously painful   it causes all sorts of drama internally and it's  only getting harder and more challenging and i can   tell you from being on the other side of the fence  that the examples you hear about on a day-to-day   basis in the news are a fraction of the kinds  of um editorial decisions that these companies   have to make on an ongoing basis over abuse and  trolling and you know and if we if we if we make   this decision i guess that means we're suspending  the new york post's account is that something we   want to be having a conversation about every day  they don't want to be doing that um they've been   forced to do this um so i do think that there's  an opportunity um by providing them with the   sort of the the gift of not having to be in that  business anymore of of giving them this sort of um   a gift of of of of a third party of middleware um  that i think they would they would um embrace the   idea behind that um and again idealistically the  the elegance of this solution is that it's kind   of like you know that it reminded me of george  mitchell being the oddsman ombudsman for the um   irish peace process irish peace process  there you had somebody who was a trusted   third party trusted by all everybody around the  table all sides and um all sides believe that   he would do what was in you know everybody's  best interest not in one side's best interest   so to the extent you could have um trusted third  parties that were these middleware providers and   not just trusted by you know again if the if the  if the one side of the um irish peace talks it   brought someone they liked but not the other side  would have never gotten anywhere um and i do think   one of the things one of the points you made  middleware providers would need to satisfy minimal   journalistic requirements is precisely  you know the one of the problems right um   look at look at facebook and twitter and who  they consider to be author high authority you   know um verified journalists and who they don't  you end up with these you know gray areas around   um one american news network and infowars  and some people saying why aren't they   why they should be allowed in other people saying  there's there's no way and my worry would be that   you end up with these middleware providers  who just exacerbate the existing problems and   you've got um some alt-right and middleware  provider that's reinforcing what people in   all right circles already believe and and vice  versa on the other side so to the extent you could   figure out some way to have some um journalistic  third party verify these middleware providers uh   that would be great and i think that would be then  fantastic and you would have to pick from this   maybe limited selection of middleware providers  i think that's um i think that would be elegant   and a great way to go about it and not  exacerbate the problem i also think that um   it's a mistake not to layer in uh privacy  into those middleware providers you know   people have so little understanding of how their  data is used and shared across these platforms   and um and there are middle there are companies  out there that understand that and want to help   people understand it but there's no great business  model for it um so to the extent you could couple   the business model for this sort of middleware  in in providing people with uh with a more um nuanced and and and uh all sides all sides um  feed with um privacy middleware that could sort   of piggyback off the um business models that you  all you all noted for a middleware provider i   think that would be great you know would be just  wonderful to understand when you buy something   from a website and ship you know i bought  something on her website and shipped it to my   daughter at her home address every time she goes  on instagram now she sees ads for this website   she's like i don't shop there before you just  ship me something from here so it'd be great to   know when you go to one of these sites hey just  so you know this address you're shipping to is   going to be coupled with and cross-checked against  all sorts of social media accounts and and given   or sold to those providers you know that would be  that would be just a world-class helpful to people   or people everywhere if you could bundle those  two things together um so those are my overall   thoughts and you know i could talk about this  stuff for five hours but happy to answer questions   great thank you dick and thanks everyone here uh  we have a great set of questions here i want to   invite anyone else who wants to post a question  to go ahead and do so uh maricha and roberta also   if you have any comments i'll turn to you in a  moment if you'd like to do so just raise your   hand otherwise you can go ahead and respond to  some of the many questions that have come in and   i'm going to start so that i would i have sort  of bucketed questions in four categories the   most common have been around the impact uh that  this is likely to have on the particular problem   of polarization and frank i know you and i have  talked about this in other webinars in the past my   understanding if uh if i am capturing your views  correctly is that we have two problems here one   of people on the extremes becoming more and  more extreme and this wouldn't necessarily   solve that problem but we have a larger problem  of this the the entire moderate population in   the world being pulled out to the extremes  by virtue of the fact that they are sort of   caught in the crossfire of a lot of disinformation  on these platforms so this would solve one problem   but not perhaps both um let me ask before turning  to the three other categories of questions   does that more or less uh sum up your views on how  this would impact political polarization uh yes so   i don't think that we can get rid of polarization  uh by any of these uh policy interventions   we have basic freedom of speech and so if you want  to believe in q anon you know you've got a right   to do that uh and i think that uh there's no  technological way to start this stuff out if you   just look at q and on itself it starts on 4chan  it goes to a [ __ ] and then you know you could do   it on signal or telegram or an encrypted channel  and so it's going to be there i i think regardless   what you don't want is amplification or  suppression on a mass scale and again this   gets back to the issue of of scale itself because  it is these large platforms that have the ability   to push this stuff out into a broader audience  uh that then can affect you know much larger   uh parts of the of the voting population  so i think that's the central issue   uh but we're not going to get rid of you know  crazy people saying crazy things on the internet   because at this point you know  it's it's simply not possible   do you remember the good old days when  political scientists were were clamoring   for more polarization and distinction in the  voting population so yeah here we are um okay so   we have a little more than 10 minutes left i'd  love to turn to a lightning round of responses   keeping them at a minute or under uh from everyone  here we have questions that fall into i would say   three categories that roughly map all of the  different stakeholders who would have to some   way engage in this process in order to make it  work and we have first questions about users   would they actually how would they find this  technology would they actually adopt it um   inserting my own views here but where you have you  know only about 50 of the population that turns   out to vote in a given presidential election  you know how much of the burden can we put on   users to adopt this new technology and would they  really uh you know eat their broccoli and choose   necessarily more moderate platforms or might they  choose to or or might be evidence of the success   of some of the current social media platforms  suggests that people maybe like some of this more   engaging and potentially polarizing content and  so there's a whole set of questions on users but   in the interest of time let me tee up a couple  of the others and then you can sort of answer   those you can choose which ones you you want to  answer and so we have questions about users we   have questions about the providers themselves  the disney's and aclus and american enterprise   institutes and having both the technological  capacity and the monetary incentives to develop   these kinds of middleware technologies given that  it would presumably require quite a lot of them   to do so and then we have a third question a set  of questions about the platforms themselves dick   you spoke to the willingness of them the potential  willingness or incentives for them to do this   which i had not necessarily anticipated i think  there have been some questions about whether they   would be willing to do so given how that might  impact their revenue models uh and then some   questions about whether the platforms themselves  would be allowed to enter these markets or would   be prohibited from doing so or whether they might  try in some way to manipulate service providers   uh so i know that is those are quite a few to tee  up there and do we want to maybe start with users   you know would they um would they adopt it how  would they find these um would it necessarily   would they necessarily eat their broccoli um  any thoughts on that roberta i thought you   coming from caspase might yeah i i have just  a couple of comments um one is a general one   we if you look at our report we have said clearly  that this middle-air middleware solution as she   said needs a lot more thought um and it and  the other thing we've said that might not have   shown up in the slides is that it will have to be  paired with some a regulatory agency's involvement   um so this will this will get rolled out  assuming this is a successful way to go   it will go rolled out in a big way um the other  thing i want to mention in terms of users is that   as someone who's just completed a study on gen  z the the familiarity of younger citizens with   with all things digital is going to solve some of  this worry about will users take the initiative   to choose one or more middleware providers so  i just want to add that perspective great thank   you other thoughts on on users or we can turn to  questions about providers but other responses here   i think that if you don't ashish mentioned  it being an opt-out as opposed to an opt-in   there will just be you'll just find that people  stick with the defaults in their preferences   far more often than you might think they would so  to the extent you put one in there to begin with   and they have to go in and change it or remove it  it's far more likely to see take up um than it is   if you make them go select one um even if you  remind them to select one this won't they won't   change the generally speaking they don't change  the default preferences i think that's a great   point i consider myself to be slightly more tech  savvy than the average person and still seldom do   i do i go back into that back end um okay so sorry  actually this point is fantastic because then we   have a way to resolve polarization we give as  a default the opposite of the political views   so if you're a republican we give you a a  democrat and vice versa and that either you   learn to change a default or you learn to increase  your views problem solved well i think the data on   that actually suggests that if you take real  extremists and confront them with polarized   information they get more pissed off and and sort  of grind their heels in but if you if you had pbs   as the default that might uh you know maybe  that would if that would get us there and okay   uh providers would people enter this space would  they have the you know there was a common round   would the aclu had the technical capacity  to do this would they have the financial   incentives to do this i recall in your paper  you suggest that potentially the platforms   be somehow required or incentivized to share  profits with these providers these middleware   providers at a certain point if you have you know  quite a lot of them how does this affect different   um competitors or profit incentives so how do you  think that that market of providers might evolve   so i think uh taking the first  part of the question which is uh   whether companies like aclu would have the  technical ability to provide this service and   this is where i think uh dick's comment about  platforms embracing it would be super useful   so it doesn't there's a whole variety of uh  ways in which you can imagine this happening   you can imagine aclu tagging important tweets  and important news items on an individual basis   but you can also imagine a company like google  taking part of his deep learning pipeline   and just moving the last layer and letting a  company like aclu provide input into how the last   layer of learning is going to work which would  allow essentially aclu to be in a transparent way   provide input to the machine learning algorithms  that google uses and again the the technical   complexity of this is going to be sufficient  that this is not going to happen without   active support from platforms and  like an active embrace of this idea   and to refer back to an earlier question about  uh there's a difference uh so what dick is   suggesting is uh that platforms might actually  embrace an idea of this type but the idea that   dick is suggesting they might embrace is where  third parties are providing editorial control   not the one where this third party just sits  on top of the platform and the entire view   of the platform is then gated by this third party  that's called disintermediation and unless i'm in   unless i'm incorrect and dick will correct me if  i'm wrong platforms will fight that to the death   yeah that's right yeah and in fact if you could  go to the platforms and say make you a deal we'll   take care of all the editorial decision making so  you don't get called in front of congress about   why you tagged this one and why not that one and  you don't get accused of preventing abuse here   but not over there we'll take care of all that  and we and we can also in exchange promise that   you know overall engagement is you know not going  to change plus or minus point x 0x percent if you   could tell them that they would say yes all day  the challenge is going to be what are these what   are these editorial filters that and a resultant  feed gonna gonna do to my engagement and we won't   know until we run those different tests no but  this is the essence of the problem sorry is the   business model wants to have a tutorial control  the moment we put an intermediary that filters   editorial control the digital platform would go  banana now might be the right thing to do but   they're gonna fight tooth and nail because that's  the end of their business model but if we don't   fix the business model we don't fix the problem  yeah i i disagree i i think to what ashish is   saying is if again if you could have told me when  i was ceo of twitter i'll take all these editorial   decisions you know what to flag and what to tag  and why not to tag off your hands but you know   look the user engagement's gonna remain the same  because of i'm not going to i'm not going to sit   over you and change everything the user sees just  the as the way she she's described people would   love that they don't want to be in the business  of getting hauled in front of congress every week   for why they tagged this tweet and that not that  tweet it's only going to result in more and more   trauma for them no no i understand but maybe i  misunderstand the middleware but if the issue is   just that they i have a ai tag of the news i don't  think that solves a problem we need a filter of   news and i'm very happy to get ai filter my news  or somebody else filter my news but twitter is not   um i think a really interesting point that you  just brought up dick that somewhat changed my   mind i had presumed that this would actually have  to reduce the platform's uh economic positions   just by virtue of other needing to finance these  other middleware providers but you could imagine a   scenario where people are getting exactly the news  that they want and ergo actually engage even more   than they currently are because they're not quite  as turned off by getting hit with all kinds of   content that they find um you know and appealing  which is actually i had not occurred to me before   i think you can run those you could of course  run those tests on different filters obviously   right and also to craft sort of so it's just very  clear sort of a middle position between the two   uh it's conceivable that uh platforms  might not be happy if they're losing a   bigger fraction of their revenue say five percent  and i think that's where sort of they might need   uh this this idea of this uh utopia where there's  a technical solution which solves all problems   everyone embraces it wholeheartedly might break  down and regulatory impetus might be needed and i   think this is related to what dick was mentioning  as him being a careless pragmatist great well we   have two minutes left i had come in i must confess  somewhat skeptical and i'm coming out actually   somewhat persuaded that this could work which  i had not uh foreseen and so it has been really   interesting here i want to offer a last round of  comments to everyone here in the last couple of   minutes and then we will turn over uh to just some  next steps and upcoming events here at the center   but um final thoughts from any and all uh kelly if  i could uh say something uh as roberta was saying   this really requires further thinking  through we need to go to some entrepreneurs   with this idea and say you know what would it  take for you to actually invest in creating a   company like this uh you know it was our feeling  that you couldn't do this all voluntarily uh   there would have to be a you know some kind of  a regulatory uh framework i'm not sure meeting   minimum journalistic uh standards is necessarily  part of that uh because you know you could get   alt-right middleware providers as well i i  think that that's uh you know that would be   uh that would be fine uh but the main thing  is to give users uh control but we don't know   and until we've actually done a lot more work in  putting this idea out i don't think we're going to   have the answer but i do think the government is  going to have to set up the incentive structure uh   you know to make the platforms open their  apis so that some version of middleware   uh would work uh just as long as i got the  floor i i really want to thank the members   of our working group uh we've been meeting  regularly uh they've and we've been supported by   uh people like uh haifa and avalon and  other staff at the cyber policy center   people put a lot of work into this over the  last 11 months and i i really hope that you   enjoy the fruits of you know all of this labor  because it really was a group effort that we   could not have done had we not been able to  you know to work together in this fashion thank you for mentioning that i know  how many folks have been involved here   and there's also been a couple of requests to  post the paper itself and i can't recall if the   foreign affairs article i i know you have  something forthcoming on that also but   if you guys could please post a link or michelle  perhaps you can if others don't have it handy   into the chat box for panelists so everyone  can access this uh we are now at the hour   any last uh burning and insightful comments  from folks uh before we turn to next steps all right barack please go ahead i i just  want to say that i i love the exchange   between dick and luigi and it illustrates  exactly what needs to be moving forward   um i i do think that our proposal needs some kind  of buy-in from the platforms it would not work   if the platform's placed in tooth and nail but  at the same time i think luigi's exactly right   this can't be just as convenient for platforms  there really does need to be a change   in how they influence political discourse and  ultimately some kind of compromise is going to be   necessary where uh not categorical changes will be  possible but substantial changes will be necessary   brock thank you and thanks everyone here this  has been a fascinating conversation so really   appreciate everyone taking the time we will be  posting this webinar on our website in the next   couple of days and uh we'll also make sure that  we add the the links to the report there in the   meantime wanted to turn quickly to some next  steps we have a number of upcoming webinars   on uh december 2nd we will have a conversation  with sam weinberg and others here at stanford   about challenges to digital literacy education  in schools on the 10th we will have a half day   event from 9 a.m to 1 p.m with a whole  range of scholars and and representatives   from other organizations talking about the  presidential election and what we have learned   on the 13th of january colleagues from common  sense and others will join us to discuss the   new book which side of history analyzing  the impact of the platforms and potential   interventions and then on the 27th maricha  shaki our colleague here and we'll talk   about the digital services act uh and uh the  implications that that is going to have once   uh passed in europe so hope folks can  join us then and really appreciated   today's conversation so thank you everyone  very much and take care and happy holidays
