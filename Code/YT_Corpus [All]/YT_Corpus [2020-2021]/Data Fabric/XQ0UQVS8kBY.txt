 from around the globe it's the cube covering HPE discover virtual experience brought to you by HPE everyone welcome to the cube studios here in Palo Alto California we here for a remote conversation we're for HPE discover virtual experience 2020 we're here with Kumar Shrikant East chief technology officer and head of software cube alumni we've been following Kumar since he started blue data and now he's heading up the software team and CTO at HP and Robert Christensen VP of strategy of office of the CTO Robert lost both cube alumni Robert formerly with CTP now part of the team that's bringing the modernization efforts around enterprises in this fast changing world that's impacting the operating models for businesses we're seeing that playing out in real time with kovat 19 as customers are modernizing the efforts guys thanks for coming on taking the time you're welcome John good to be back here Kumar first I have to have you I have to ask you your new role at HPE sent it up to CTO but also head of the software how do you describe that role because your seat to you and also heading up the software as a general manager could you take them in to explain this new role and why it's important thank you thank you John and so good to be back you get two for one with me and Robert yeah it's it's very exciting to be here as a CTO of HP and as Antonio described in in the his announcement we conserve software will be very key essential part of the our pivot as a service and we want we see that it's an opportunity for not only lay out the vision but help drive the execution of that vision both organically and inorganically so we we see we want to have a differentiated software that helps customers to to get us to the workloads optimized for all their specific solutions you guys were both on the cube in November pre cove vid with minimun John Troy you're talking about the container platform news leveraging the acquisitions you guys have done at HPE Kumar your company blue datum a power CTP Robert the group you are they're really talking about the strategies around running these kinds of workloads and if you think about Cove in nineteen this transformation it's really changing work workforces workplaces workloads workflows everything to do with work and people are at home that's an extension of the on-premise environment VPN provisions were under provision we're hearing all these stories exposing all the things that need to be worked on because no one ever saw this kind of direction it highlights the modern efforts that a lot of your customers are going through Robert can you explain and Kumar talk about this digital transformation in this kovat and then when we come out of it the growth strategies that need to be put in place and the projects take a minute to explain go ahead Robert Howard has been spending a lot of time with our customers and I will add to that go ahead oh yeah thank you so much it's a accelerators what's happened many of our clients have been forced into the conversation about how do I engage our customers and how do we engage our broad constituents including our employees and colleagues in a more rapid and easier way and many of the systems that were targeted to make their way to a public cloud digital transformation process did not get the attention just because of their size and breadth and depth and effort so that's really put an accelerator down on what are we going to do so we have to be able to bring a platform into our clients organizations that have the same behavior of characteristics or what we call you know the same cloud experiences that people are expecting in public and bring it close to our clients data and their applications and without having that you don't have a platform by which you can have an accelerated digital transformation because it's historically a public less been the only path to get that done what we are really considering what we introduced a while ago was that platform near our clients applications the data that gives them that ability to move quicker and respond to these in this period situations in specific what's happened with company really pushes it harder for real solutions now that they can hacked on Kumar your thoughts on this precoded yeah yeah this is the piece of acceleration or the digital transformation is just he's a logarithmic we multiplied the covert I think as you pointed out John the the remote working in the VPNs the security we were as an edge to the cloud platform company we were already in that space so it's actually very clear as Robert pointed out it's actually nice to see that transformation is his transition are rapidly getting to the digitization but one thing that is very interesting to note here is you can you can't lift and shift of data as a gravity and you actually saw we actually see the war all the distributed cloud we see that we are glad to see what we've been we've been talking about prior to the co-ed and recently even the industry I'm least so talking about we believe there is a compute can happen where the data is and this is actually an interesting point for me to say this is why we have actually announced our new software platform HP as Murrell which is our our key differentiated pillar for our as a service pillar that companies focusing on could you talk about what this platform is you guys are announcing the capabilities and what customers can expect from this is it a repackaging is there something new here what's is it something different making something better what can you just give us a quick taste of what this is and what it means good yeah so yeah that's a great question is it repackage there is it actually something new well I'm happy to say it's a combination of a lot of existing assets that come together in the ecosystem I think a platform that is super unique you know you look at what the blue data container and an adoption of kubernetes holistically as a control plane as well as our data fabric motion to the market with Matt Barr and you combine that with our network experiences and our other platform very specific platform solutions in the our clients data that all comes together in intellectual property that we have that we packed together and make work together so there's a lot of new stuff in there but more importantly we have a number of other close partners that we've brought together to form out our as morale platform we have a new really interesting combination of security and authentication pieces through our site tell organization that came underneath with us a little few months back and our aggressive motion towards bringing in strong networking services and flexi as well so these all come together and I'm sure leaving a few out there all specifically with their input site software to continue deploy I Drive a solution on premises that provides that world-class and a services that we believe johny johny was the question at the beginning is what is it why the software role is this is exactly that I was waiting for that that of that moment where Robert pointed out our goal is we have a lots of good assets and auditioned a lot of good partnerships we believe the market is the customers want outcome based solutions based motion not I want a piecemeal right so we have an opportunity to provide the customers the solution from the top to the bottom we announced at the discover a ml ops as a service which is actually total top to the bottom and to end customers can build em all solutions on the top of the Green Lake this is built on HP as model platform so it's not I wouldn't use the word repackaging but it is actually a lot of the inorganic organic technologies that have come together that build the solution up to the bar you know I don't think it's a negative to package something up and talk not I wasn't I didn't think negative but I was just saying that it is a it's a it's a lot of new stuff but also as Robert said the in blue data you built a very powerful container platform as you said you just mentioned that Yukon we announced it one of the things I liked about your talk on November was that the culture is kind of getting in the weeds but stateless versus stateful date as a big part of it but if you look at the cloud and public cloud and horizontal scalability no one wants piecemeal that was word you guys attention or these siloed tools anything about the workforce workplace transformation with kovat it's exposing the edge to everybody it's not just an IT conversation you need to have software that traverses the environment so you're now looking at not so much Point solutions best-of-breed what you guys have had in the past but saying ok I got to look at this thing holistically and say how do I make sure I make sure security which is the new perimeters the hole rate or wherever this is no perimeter is is everywhere so this is now just an architectural concept not so much a point solution right I mean it's that they're kind of how you're thinking about it that's correct in fact as you said the data is generated at the edge and you take the compute and it's with the edge to the cloud platform what we have actually what we're actually demonstrating is we want to give a complete solution no matter where the processing needs are and with HP you have now that cloud like experience both as on prime as well as what we call a hybrid I think let's be honest the world is going to be hybrid and you can actually see the changes that is happening even from the public cloud vendors they're trying to come on pram so HP is being established player in this and with this technology I think provides that solution you can process where the data is generate yeah I would agree it's hybrid I would say multi cloud is also you know code word for multi environment Robert and Robert I want to do it as you mentioned it in your talk with Stu minim in November consistency across environments so when you talk to customers Robert what are they saying because I can imagine them in zoom meetings right now or teleconferencing saying look at we have to have an operating model that spans public on-premise multiple environments whether it's edge or clouds I have different environments and being managed separately in different data modeling I won't have a control plane and this is architectural I mean it's kind of complex but customers are dealing with this right now what are you hearing from customers how are they handling are they doubling down on certain projects are they reshaping some of their investments I mean what's the mindset of the customer right now the mindset is that the customers are under extreme pressure to control cost improve automation and governance across all their platforms the business the businesses that we deal with have established themselves in a public cloud at least to some extent with what they call their systems of engagement those are although a lot of the elastic systems the hype that wants the diverse users do very well and then they have all of their existing on-premise systems which you typically you know heavily focused on a VM based mindset which is being more more viewed as a legacy actually and so they're looking for that next decade of operating while that spans both the public and the private cloud on-premises world and what's risen up in that operating model is the open source kubernetes orchestration based operating model where they gives them the potential of walking into another operating model that's holistic across both public and private but more importantly has a way for their existing platforms to move into this new operating model that's what you were talking about using stateful applications that are more legacy minded monolithic but still can run in the container based platform and move to a new holistic operating model nobody's under the impression by the way that the existing operating model we have today on premises is compatible with a cloud operating model those two are not compatible in any shape or form we have to get to operating model that holistic in nature and we see that path as being and that's a great tee up for the software question Robin I want to go to come on I want to get your thoughts because you know I know you personally and I've been following your careers certainly you know well well well deep in computer science of software so I think it's a good role for you but if you look at what the future is and this is the conversation we're having with CIOs and customers on the cube is when I get back to work post code but I got to have a growth stress I need to reset reinvent and have growth strategy and all the conversations come back to him the apps that they have to redevelop or modernize right so workloads or whatever so what that means is they really want true agility not just as a punch line or a cliche they got a moose security into the DevOps pipe lining they got to make the application environments DevOps and DevOps was kind of a fringe industry thing for about a decade and now that's implement that's influencing IT ops security ops and network ops these are operational systems not just you know hey let's you know sling some kubernetes and service meshes around this is like real nuts and bolts business operations so you know IT ops is impacted SEC Ops is in fact impacted they working offs not for the faint of heart DevOps I get that now it's coming everywhere what's your thoughts on that what's your reaction we see those thing coming together John so again going back to the HP as well what the world we believe this innovative software is it can run on any infrastructure to start with whether it's HP hardware and on HP hardware it's a called a hybrid and as we said we talked about it is it is we it's whether it is an edge or it is where the processing is we also committed to providing integrated optimized secure elastic and automated solutions right this is I think your question about it's not just appealing to the one segment of the organization I think there's going to be a I cannot just say I'm only giving you the DevOps solution or it has to have a security built in dude this is why we are actually committed to making our solutions more elastic more scalable we are investing in building a complete runtime stack and making sure it has the all the fleet controls it's not only optimized for the work solution which we call the work runtime stack it's also has this is our Green Lake solution that that brings these two pieces together Wow you easy yeah sorry go ahead go ahead John so Robert you mention automation earlier this is where the automation dream comes in you mission ml ops - sir this what you're really getting at is programmability for the developer across-the-board right it's that kind of what you're thinking or well there's two parts to that this is really important the developer community is looking for set of tools that they can be very creative and movement with right they don't want to have to be worried about provisioning managing maintaining any kind of infrastructure to get that done and so there's this bridge between that automation and the actual getting things done so that's number one but more importantly and I think this is hugely important as you look about pushing into the on-premises world for for HPE or anybody else to succeed in that space you have to have a high degree of automation that takes care of potential problems that humans would analyze have to get involved with and that's when they had costs so you have to drive in a what Kumar start going to fleet controls of fleet management services that automate their behavior and give them an SLA that they are accustomed to public cloud so you've got two sets of automations that you really have to be dealing with not only are you talking about the DevOps the second 60 you just talked about but you've got to have a corresponding automation base back into to drive a higher user experience at both levels and as well as platforms is cool I get that I hear that so the question next question on that Kumar is platforms have to enable value what are you guys enabling for the value when you talk to customers because who everyone sees the platform play as them as the architecture but it has to create disruptive enabling value what do you yeah I'll go and as a starter I think we pointed out to you this when we announced the container platform it's of the very unique it's not only it's an its open-source Dubin it is it has a persistent one or the best underlying persistent storage integrated the original map our file system as I pointed out drones one of the world's largest data bases and we can actually allow the customers to run both both stateful and stateless workloads and as I said few minutes ago we are committed to having the runtime software run and both HP Hardware non hardware so the customers have the choice and in addition to all of that I think we are upon all the very unique solutions we are offering these ml apps as we talked about and this is only beginning and we have a lots of other for example Robert is working on a solution hopefully we'll announce sometime soon which is similar to that some of the key elements that we are seeing in the marketplace the the the various solutions that goes from the top to the bottom Robert to you on the same question what's in it for me in the customer bottom line what's the what's in it for me well I think just the ease of simplicity what we are ultimately want to provide for our client is one opportunity to solve a bunch of problems that otherwise have to stitch together myself it's really about value and speed to value if I don't have to solve let's say a computer vision problem in my manufacturing facility and I need a solution and I don't have the IT resources the wherewithal and stacks like that but I got to bring a bigger solution in I want a company that knows how to deliver a computer vision solution there or within an airport or whatever where I don't need to build out sophisticated infrastructure or people or technologies necessary to support it on my own or have some third party product that doesn't have a vested interest in the whole stack HPE is purposely it focused on delivering that experience with one organization from both hardware and software up through the stack including the applications that we believe are the highest value to the client we want to be that organization and we'll be that organization on premises point I think that's great consistent with what we're hearing if you can help take the heavy lifting away and have them focus on their business and the creativity I think the application Renaissance and transformation is gonna be a big focus both on the infrastructure side but also just straight-up application developers I mean it's going to be really critical path for these companies that come out of this so congratulations on that love love love the formula final conclusion question for both of you guys this is something that a lot of people might be asking at HP discover virtual experience or in general as they have to plan and get back to work and reset reinvent and grow their organizations where is HP heading how do you see HP heading how would you answer that question if customers like Kumar Robert where's HP heading how would you answer that go ahead of it and then I'll come to yeah yeah I see us heading into the true distributed hybrid platform play where that they would look to HPE of handling and providing all of their resources and solutions and needs as they relate to technology further and further into what their specific edge locations would look like so edge is different for everybody and what HPD is providing us a holistic view of compute and our storage and our solutions all the way up through whether they be very close to edge locations are all the way through the data center and including the integration with our public cloud partners out there so I see HP is actually solving real valued business problems in a way that's turnkey and definable for our client and real value John I think I'll start with the world antonio shared we are a h to the cloud everything as a service company and I think the where HP setting is HP is valley legend and it's actually honor to be part of the such a great company I think what we have to change with the market transformation the customer needs and what we are doing is we are providing the customers the innovative solution that you don't have to we don't have to take your data where the compute is as a first you can take the compute where the data is and we provide you the simplified autumn secure solutions no matter where you where your execution needs are and that is through the significant innovation of the software both for Admiral and the green leg box that's awesome and you know for all of us have been through multiple ways of innovation is we've seen this movie before it's essentially distributed computing region and re architected with their capabilities the new scale I mean it's almost back to the old days of you know network operating rooms and networking and OS is and you know yeah it's a computer that's a very very good I'll conclude the following way right I mean it is it's two plus two is four no matter what universe you go to but you have to change with the market forces I think the market is what is happening in the market force as you pointed out there was a shadow IT there's a DevOps and there is ideas that are network ops insecure so now I think we see that all coming together I call this kubernetes is the best equalizer or the past platform the reason why it became popular is because it's provided that abstraction layer and I think what we are trying to do is okay if that is what the customers wants and we provide you the solution that helps you to build that very quickly without having to lock into any specific platform I think you've got a good strategy there I would agree with you I would call that like cartlett the old tcp/ip what that did networking back in the day kubernetes is a unifying disruptive enabler and I think it's you know it enables things like a runtime stack of things or you're mentioning these are the new realities and I think Ovid 19 has exposed this new architectures of the world and on one last show or say the quinces of not having something in place yeah yes I did so the last thing I would say is it's we are not bolting Google earnest to anything old technologies it's a fresh it's a built in it's an open source and it is as a service that it can run on any platform that you choose to run now well next time we get together we'll riff on observability and security and all that good stuff because that's what's coming next all the baked in guys thank you so much Kumar Robert thanks for spending the time really appreciate here for the P discovered virtual experience cube conversation thanks for thanks for joining me today thank you very much okay I'm John furry but still looking angle to cube we're here in our remote Studios getting all the top conversations for HPE discover virtual experience thanks for watching
