 live from Las Vegas it's the cube covering Splunk con 19 but to you by spunk hey welcome back everyone's live cube coverage in Las Vegas at spunks comm 2019 this is their annual customer conference where they unleash all the new technologies announced all the new things there once a year it's the 10th anniversary of Splunk comm the cubes seventh year we've been covering this long been quite the journey from scrappy startup going public growth phase now market leader and also has to come the success from the products and the engineering and of course the people in the field that that serve customers and we're here with Susan st. Leger who's the president of worldwide field operations thanks for coming back good to see you thank you John is decided to be here so in the keynote bringing data to every outcome is really the theme you seem to got a spring to your step here you cited this year what an amazing successful show because you got a platform but the proof is out there you've got an ecosystem you got people building apps on top of it it's kind of all coming together this year it's serious serious it's it it's just it's a it's a huge leap forward and I think so much of it is the vision of data to everything and if you think about it we talk about we want to bring data to every question every problem and every action and the biggest thing you're going to see that you did see in the show is it's no longer just about the Splunk index we're gonna help you get you get value out of data wherever it lives and you have some big news on acquisition front signal FX big chunk of change for that company private in a hot category observability which really teases out that next 20 mile stair in the marketplace which is cloud native that's hanging cloud services which comes together in the platform with logging all kind of coming together yeah it's so exciting we we looked hard at that entire and signal FX was definitely the right answer they operated a scale similar to us they know how to how to operate at that scale and so they're gonna be able to serve our customers well and you know our view of the world is it's going to be hybrid for a very long time but they serve that new cloud native world better than anybody else it's when you do monitoring the cloud native world it's really interesting to think about it's all made up of micro services right so thousands of micro services hundreds thousands of micro services and so in traditional monitoring it's always you're trying to monitor things that you know could go wrong in a micro service landscape you don't know everything that could possibly go wrong and so it's a level of complexity that's just very different and so it's all about instrumenting so that when something does go wrong you can solve it you guys have a very loyal based customer base and that's a good again testament to the success but the product has changed and the value problems is emerging even further with data that's a big theme data too everywhere everything and security has come up on the radar a few years ago here to show but this almost is a full-blown security show at this point because security center of everything and can't ignore it it's become a centerpiece of everything the date of the access to the diversity how has that impact as the field because you're not I mean I guess you're a security company enabler and solve security problems date is a big part of it so how is that shaping your operations so I think the thing to understand is correct we're not just the security company but we are number one in the security magic quadrant we're number one in both IDC and Gartner and so that's important but what happens is all of the data that you collect for security can also be used for all these other use cases so generally speaking whatever you're collecting for security is also valuable for IT operations and it's also valuable for many other use cases so I'll give you an example Domino's which is a great customer of ours they're they've done 65% of their orders now come in digitally ok and so they monitor the entire end-to-end customer experience but they monitor it not only from an IT operations perspective that same data that they use for IT operations also tells them you know what's being ordered what special orders are being made and they use that data for promotions based upon volume and traffic and timing they actually create promotions so now you're talking about the same data that you collected for a security night operations you can actually use for promotions which is marketing there's a lot of operating leverage and data you're getting at this the old model was is a database make a query get a report a little time problem there but now you have well that other date is over there in another database who runs that data so the world has certainly changed its now data needs to be addressable this seems to be a big theme here an undercurrent I know data to everywhere it's kind of a global theme but them up diverse data feeds AI correct and address ability allows for application access correct so we look at the entire data landscape and say we want to help you get data value out of your data wherever it lives and in its right now we've changed to the point where we are operating on data in motion which is with data stream processor which is hugely beneficial you mentioned you know AI ml we actually do something so unique from an ml perspective because we're actually doing the ML on the live streaming so so much more valuable than doing it in batch mode and so the ability to create those ml models by working on live data is super powerful that's a good announcements - you guys had the data processor you have the search fabric data fabric so real time and acceleration our themes there I want to get your thoughts on your new pricing options yes why now what's that mean for customers so if we want to bring data to everything we have to allow them to actually get all the data right so we needed to give them more flexible models and more alternative models so for some people the ingest model is very comfortable but what they want it was more flexibility so if you look at our neutrons pricing and our predictable pricing there's a couple of things that we've done with it number one is from 125 gig all the way up to unlimited will show you you're predictable pricing so you don't have to guess well if I move from 20 terabytes to 50 what's that going to cost me we're going to tell you No and so that's one the second thing is you don't have to land on the exact ingest so before if you bought a terabyte you got a terabyte right now there's a tranche from one to two terabytes there's a trunks from two to five terabytes and so it gives the customers flexibility so that they don't have to worry about it coming back to buy more right away so that's kind of a cloud mile buy as you go variable pricing exactly I want to get your thoughts on some of the sales motions and positioning that you guys have out in the field visa fees the industry we've seen a lot of success and say observability for instance we're stuffing to Rick and Karthik about this yes you guys are an enterprise software cloud and on-premises provider you enterprise sales motion yes but there's a lot of other competition out there that sell for the SMB they're like tools what's the difference between an offering that might look like Splunk but may be targeting the SMB small mid-sized business and one that needs to be full-blown enterprise yeah so I think the first and foremost most of the offerings that we see land in SMB they have scale issues over time right and so what we look at it and say is and they're mostly point products right so you can you can clutter up your environment with a bunch of point products doing all these different things and try and stitch them together or you can go with this flood platform so which allows you to to perform all of those same operations whether it be IT security or you know data analytics in general but it really is it's about having the platform and so you guys what reduce the steps it takes to implement or what's the value I guess isn't here's here's the thing what's the pitch so I'm an enterprise I'm like okay I have you know chap dad I got a lot of potential things going on I got a reach platform I need to make my data work for me I need the data be everywhere iog enterprise cloud what's the Splunk pitch so our pitches were bringing data to everything and first and foremost it's important understand why because we believe at the heart of every problem is a data problem and we're not just talking IT and security as you know you saw so many examples I think you talked to zone Haven earlier this week right wildfires is a data problem New York Presbyterian is using it using us for opioid crisis right that's a data problem so if everything's a data problem what you want is a platform that can operate against that data and remove the barriers between data and action and that's really what we're focused on you mentioned zone Haven that was part of swung ventures fund you guys have a social impact fund yes what's the motivation behind that is it just a social good is there a business reason behind it or both what's this yeah so we actually have two social focuses one is funk for good and that is nonprofit what we announced this what we announced a couple weeks ago that we reiterated yesterday was the spunk social impact fund so split ventures social impact fund and this is to invest in for-profit companies that are using data for social good and the whole reason is that we look at it and so we say we're a platform if you're a platform you want to build out the ecosystem right and so the spunk innovation fund spunk Ventures Innovation Fund is to invest in new technology focused on that that brings value out of data and the on the other side it's they swung social impact to get data companies that are taking data and creating social groups plunk for good as Splunk employees are a separate nonprofit entity it's not a separate nonprofit entity but it is what we what we invest in we're investing in not investing in a problem yeah exactly like when we talked about the global emancipation network right which uses Splunk to fight human trafficking that's on the nonprofit side so take me through this it's a very hot area we've been covering the tech for good because our own talk about now is tech for bed Mark Zuckerberg testifying in front of Congress this morning kind of weird to watch that actually but there's a lot of good use cases the tech that can be shaped for good a lot of companies are starting and getting off the ground for good things but they're kind of like SMB but they want the Splunk benefit how do they engage with Splunk if I'm gonna do a social impact thing say cube for good I got all this tech how do I engage funk I want it but I don't know what to do do I have access to tools how do I buy or engage with Splunk yes a spur disappointment yours is making sure it's not just money right it's money it's access to talent it's access to our product and it's you know help with actually thinking through what they're trying to achieve so it really is the entire focus it's not just about the tech the other thing I would say is you saw that we put out a schmuck investigate and you also saw us talk about Splunk business flow and mission control those are now all built on a native SAS platform and so the ability for our ecosystem now to go build on a native sized platform is going to be incredibly powerful so you expecting more accelerated opportunities that's amazing all right what's your favorite customer success stories I know it's hard to pick your favorites like picking a favorite child and they can play with the categories mostly ambitious class clown class favor I mean what's the ones you would call really strong so I hit on a couple of them I love our Domino's story and the other one that I love that I touched on but I want to expand on because I think it's an amazing story as New York Presbyterian and using the SC's point for traditional security for privacy tient privacy they also use it for medical devices but here's the thing they use it for to help the opioid crisis and you're like how is opioid crisis a data problem what they do is they actually correlate all the data that so the doctors that are prescribing the opioids who they're prescribing them to the number of prescriptions being filled in their pharmacy and then the inventory of opioids because they actually have you know sensors on all the cabinets where they get the opioids they correlate all that data and they make sure they that if they understand if opioids are being stole from the hospital because what people don't understand is that the opioid a lot a big part of the opioid crisis starts with hospitals cuz they have such a big volume of opioid and so that to me is just I guess I love it because it's a great customer success story but it's also again it's a lot of deaths I got to ask you around your favorite moments here at Kampf and your a lot of conversations and your customer conversations this year let's do a little Splunk of the cube right now can take the patterns all the data your meetings what's the top patterns that are emerging what are the some of the top conversation themes that just keep popping up with customers specifically I think the biggest thing is that they have seen more innovation unleashed this year than they have ever seen in one year from swung the other thing is that we've gone far outside of our traditional Splunk index right and that the portfolio has grown so much and that we're allowing them to operate and get value out of the data wherever it lives so data in motion and then you saw in data fabric search will let you query not only the Splunk indices but also HDFS and s3 buckets and more buckets to count so more syncs if you will so really what we're trying to do is say we're just going to be your data platform to help you get value Susan you're a great leader it's belong congratulations on your success again that continued to grow every year Blunk defies the critics now you're a market leader culture is a big part of this what is your plans this year to take it to the next level you're president of field worldwide field operations that's a global business landscape what are some of your goals and objectives and culture in the culture yeah and so thank you John first of all for your comments and we are so committed to our culture I think you know as you grow so quickly it takes a real effort to stay focused on culture we have an incredible diversity of inclusion program and we do we it's a business imperative for us and every single leader has diversity diversity inclusion focuses and targets and so I think that's a huge part of our culture and the reason I say that John I don't know if you've ever heard about our million data points did anybody ever talk about always talk about you know in different different settings we'll share a couple of our million data points what we want to make sure as a culture is that we have our employees showing up with their authentic self and because you do your best work when you can show up as your authentic self and so we have people share a handful of their million data points at all different times throughout the year to get to know each other as individuals as human beings and really understand what matters to each other and I love that million data points culture and I glad that we truly live it again it's about authenticity and so I think that's what makes us incredibly special and inclusion helps that trust yes I also just add to that we're very proud of the fact that we made the fortune list this year for best places to work for women so it shows that our focus you know we started we started revealing our metrics just about two years ago and we've had significant improvement we believe that what you focus on what you measure is what you improve so we started measuring it and improving it and this year we made the list for fortune that's called walking the talk it is gradually I think we're very excited about awesome and global expansion I'm assuming is on the radar as well always especially at this point we're ready to double down in some of the tier one markets globally for sure Susan st. Leger president of worldwide field operations here inside the cube where day two sprung Compton 10th anniversary of their customer conference our seventh year covering as well amazing ride they continue to ride the big wave is the cube bringing you all the data and insights here I'm John Fourier thanks for watching [Music]
