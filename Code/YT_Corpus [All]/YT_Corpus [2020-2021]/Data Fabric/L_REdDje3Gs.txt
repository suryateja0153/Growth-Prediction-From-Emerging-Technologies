 live from San Francisco it's the cube covering Google plot next nineteen not to you by Google cloud and its ecosystem partners everyone welcome back to the third day of live coverage the cube here in San Francisco for Google cloud next 2019 I'm John for the hosts of the cube Mike Oh stupid and men's do good to see this morning great to see you John had a very special guest here George curry and the CEO of net AB not to be confused with Thomas curry and his twin brother who's the CEO of Google cloud George great to see you good morning thanks for stopping by thank you for having me so when you've been walking through the hallways you getting like a lot of looks and some selfies people want to take a selfie with you thing in your new Thomas my name is Q so what's it like it's exciting to see all of the innovation here and the real commitment that Google's made to building out an enterprise platform we've been working with them for many years and we are excited at all of the potential new opportunities that creates alongside Google's customers and ours yeah it's gotta be interesting it's almost a little bit of a mirror image is Google is looking to get deeper into the enterprise and of course we've been documenting Netta for many years now has good move beyond just being an enterprise company you've been moving the cloud maybe we could just go back tell us a little bit some of the lessons you've learned and you know what what you're seeing happen dynamics in this space I think customers Thomas said you know many of the core tenets that we see which is customers want to operate in a hybrid multi-cloud world they want to have cloud technology integrated into their data centers and conversely their applications be portable with a common programming model I think it's come a long way you know I think our technology is now available natively in the Google Cloud I think the programming model with micro services and containers and with kubernetes as an orchestration layer truly allows you know this kind of hybrid world to operate and I think our opportunity there is to help our customers use data properly across all these landscapes understand where it is you know orchestrate new applications as well as traditional so that they can progress their business and so it's you know I tell you coming to these conferences over the last three to five years you can see the pace of change really start to accelerate I'm interested in what you guys think well one of the things we've been commenting on the Cuban are opening segments is kind of looking at how the transformation of Google cloud from Google a large-scale they know data they know tech into becoming an enterprise so a lot of window dressing around the event you know digital transformation all the right words but they got the technology and you know one of the things I'd love to get your perspective of because it's now it's no secret that the Korean brothers yourself and your brother Thomas are have great tech chops also have tons of enterprise experiences you specifically have been involved in a lot of ecosystems that's been a big topic here can Google really get an ecosystem up and running I mean they participate in the CNC F with cloud native but as an organization this is something that you're very familiar with and NetApp you've been in many ecosystems you've seen the formula how how how should that evolve because it's changing the services base I think you're part of the consult Google Cloud from what I've been reporting here what's the ecosystem formula for for this new cloud world you know I'll tell you that enterprises expect their providers to work together that's always been the expectation and we've had to coexist with even our competitors for a long period of time I think the core ideas there are to keep the customer at the center of the discussion and figure out how to best solve their problems regardless of whether it is having to coexist with someone else right I think what's been interesting to me is Linux has really become sort of the core underpinning of the cloud and Linux was an open source technology that in the early years IBM backed and sponsored I think containers together with you know what Google's doing to sponsor it has really become the opportunity to create the next kind of layer of you know common development model programming MA common orchestration I think there's that promise I think it's got to be realized Georgie what you talked about the change that we see in the industry and you know we know enterprise is not like oh let's just redo everything we were doing if whether I'm a five year old or you know 150 year old company I have things that I need to look at and I mean the applications are really tough it'd be wonderful if I just had a clean sheet of paper and I can make it all serverless or containerize all my pieces there the message I heard a lot this week is you know meeting customers where they are it's not just Google we know has great tech and smart people maybe a little too smart sometimes but you know I'd love to your viewpoint is you know those enterprise customers are they catching up to the pace of innovation faster and making more change or you know is it still one of these things that we're gonna measure in decades as to how long it takes to move things I think you know I see it in a couple of ways one is which industry are you in and the impact of you know transformation to your industry I think if you are in a highly digitally oriented industry like media and entertainment you've got to transform quickly because the whole industry is getting transformed right I think conversely if you're an industry where digitization helps your workforce be more productive I think you can take more time what we see also is in the places that are common for example in how you evolve your customer experience and how you interact with customers we see virtually every company needing to transform right and I so I see that you know this is a long transformation it's not gonna happen overnight I think that customers will pragmatically choose to you know either refactor existing applications of Bill net new on a case-by-case business process by business process basis and that's why we see hybrid sort of being the de-facto operating model well get your thoughts on multi cloud in hybrid I've seen the modern application Renaissance and revolutions kind of happening whether you call it a renaissance or Rivlin applications are exploding that's clear well cloud and hybrid cloud are key architectural shifts I'm writing a story right now about the Department of Defense a big contract that was awarded to or to shortly and Microsoft and 80s but one of the things that the people arguing is that it should be multi cloud now the Department of Defense as an example this is public sector but also enterprises have the same makeup there you have hundreds of cloud projects hundreds and Department is 500 cloud projects so it's not one clap but that's not Amazon right so this is a world where workloads and clouds selection and the parts of the architecture have to support multiple our clouds can you explain that kind of what that means to customers because people get often confused come from the old way I'm buying IBM I'm buying Oracle I'm buying a Google cloud and we're done no it's really not that case can you kind of can react to that most enterprises that we speak to have hundreds of applications everything from you know mainframe-based core business processing to highly digital you know mobile based customer interaction applications I think they have sort of a portfolio approach to manage those where they say hey some of those are going to stay on premise some of those are going to stay in a private cloud and then I've got this palette of you know choices around whether I choose software as a service or infrastructure or platform as a service and I think that when you look at a you know reasonably large company like ours we run about 500 applications in the company there's no single pallet right you've got to have these interoperate I think from a governance standpoint from how you integrate the data across these landscapes and from how you ensure compliance security and so on and I so I think that you know whenever a company tries to say that I can do everything I think that's a little bit facetious to be honest and so the reality is multiple workloads multiple cloud projects will happen multiple vendors but in a new way the rock load driven the date I'll say the date is critical storage ski you know I think back to the storage world storage was always a fragmented marketplace and I have my application silos that I that I did this now you know what have we learned from multi-cloud that were from multi-vendor as we go into multi cloud and how can we allow customers to really unlock that value of data because if it all stays fragmented in silos it's a lot harder to be able to actually leverage it use it for all the you know a IML or data value absolutely I think you know one of the long-term theses we've had is that the world gradually moves from system centric or process centric to a data centric world where the core asset that you're operating on is not the value of an individual business process but the integration across your business processes right and so this is why we think in a hybrid world you need something like a data fabric to stitch together all of these landscapes those landscapes need to increasingly be stitched together in real time because of the speed of decision making or the use of you know real-time analytics or real-time business you know processing and so that's why we've integrated our technology into multiple landscapes right both traditional but increasingly containerized or cloud-based cloud native applications and I think that's again a multi-year journey I think IT has to transform IT architectures as to transform and frankly businesses need to as well they need to think about data as a property of the whole business rather than of a function or Depar so just a click on the double-click on that for a second because what you're saying is a data fabric allows for multiple data to move around the workloads so what you're saying is if you want to take it mall I'm saying one take advantage of machine learning and AI the data has to be addressable in real time meaning you don't have time to go fetch it from a database that may or may not be available at any given time so making data addressable horizontally scalable for whatever workload at any given time from retail to personalization or whatever right absolutely right so for example if you look at the way a AI or an ml data pipeline works there's a period in the pipeline which is about training and feature engineering where you're trying to develop the model the right way and then you're gonna let the model run but the models gonna be reacting to real-time data input and constantly making transformations to how the business reacts I think that data input needs to be fed in from all of the business processes that support the business right rather than a hey I'm gonna create an artifact that's a static artifact that's trained once and then you're gonna run the business so that's why we think you've got to operate the hybrid world as an integrated world at the data layer George one of the interest there's a study that Google put out they declared a group Dora that looks at high-performing environments and you know what differentiates kind of the you know the leaders from the pack you talk to a lot of companies and I'm sure you must you know how have some but you know opinions on this okay tell us what what is separating you know the leaders in the end-user space is to you know from from those that are that are following I think that the leaders you know are have the capability to transform themselves and transformation you know people talk about digital transformation I think the most important part of that is actually the transformation part and it's organizing people to allow experimentation learning from experimentation to celebrate failure I think that's hard for big companies to do right because you're set up to ensure that you're managing the risk of not failing on the other hand I think in a world where there's a new game being created you got to be able to allow the organization to try different things and it's okay to fail and the speed pressure to to go faster right certainly with cloud everything's accelerated from time to market time to value technology development and I think that is also one of the fundamental changes going on in the industry we were at the end of paradigm where they were horizontal slices of expertise which is really the optimum ultimate optimization of an existing paradigm the new paradigm isn't exactly clear so you know to move faster IT is creating vertically integrated squads you look at you know Google's creation of a site reliability engineer it's really a way to accelerate the creation of digital services and optimize the infrastructure associated with it so it's a time of change I think you know our view is you got to lean into it and you've got to trust the fact that the skills and the cultural values that you've brought are going to help you innovate into the future not necessarily the just the products and the ways that you've done them and so that's why we think culture is a massively important part of these plans for me here George Korean CEO of net AB not to be confused of Thomas currency of Google who's also walking around the floorshow floor talking to customers George thanks for coming on sharing their insight you guys are awesome the twins are super smart running two big companies thanks for spending the time sheriff's personal story with George I mean Thomas doesn't come on yet I hope he's too busy we'll get him later on the cube but share a story about it what's he like who wins the arm wrestling matches well what share up sir what's he like with tell personal story I think he's shy I think you know we're both really we realize how lucky we are you know we've grew up in places where people you know some of us had sort of unmerited grace you know the blessings of being born to extraordinarily good families and parents and so we're always cognizant of that it's amazing that two guys in India who had never seen a computer till we left India to come to the United States now have the opportunity to be a big part of the computer industry so we're just really grateful and God's been good to us well congratulations love the tech tech chops valuing culture big right now thanks for spending the time sharing the inside thanks you having George Curie here on the Q with John frame is myself was too many men more cube coverage after this short break
