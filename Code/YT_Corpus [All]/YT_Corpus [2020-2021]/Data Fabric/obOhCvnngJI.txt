 material magic back this hasn't been here since July and this is how you're gonna take any fabric and basically magically turn it into like a paper like material with this all-natural non-toxic formula that won't affect the quality of your fabrics so sky's the limit with this this is no fun it's between anything you would do with paper it's like secret sauce if you love to sew and you have been using a traditional sizing that would you know discolor over time may it contain sugar this is an all-natural fabric stabilizer it's called Theriot magic and it is magic what watch what is - gonna do it's going to take a beautiful piece of cotton fabric okay or any fabric for that matter that has a beautiful drape to it it's going to turn it into a fray free paper like surface what you see what would from soft to completely like paper and now we can do all kinds of things with it so how this actually works is that you're going to take your you're getting 48 ounces so you're getting the spray bottle plus the refill of this like I said magics pretty good I have Dan I my fabric is damp and you would treat it in a bucket you would treat you would you could do it in the bathtub you want to use the spray to actually coat the fabric all the way through and then you can leave it to like air dry ever so slightly but what I'm gonna do I didn't probably didn't get it on everything she wanted to make sure that it's soaked all the way through and then what's fun is I'm gonna take my Cricut I'm easy press and to speed things I am I'm going to use it so this is this isn't part of the demo but that you know as crafters we have the Cricut easy press and what is going to do is it's going to dry that terial magic say I'm not I'm not quite warm enough yet so simile you would let it air dry so you can get a little bit like yes right and then you would use this to to actually it processes it it makes it into that fray free surface barrier it's really it's it's an amazing thing so what happens to see how it's nice and stiff on the inside now even if my edges aren't done but what happens is this you're gonna like this Michelle cuz I you know as a paper crafter I'm always thinking about how can I use this for paper for crafting well we have so we've got it we've treated it so that it's fray free this paper likes now if you can actually take your cutting dies and cut it okay so I can run this through my impress machine and I can cut with any of my dies I can make a beautiful card and you know embellish with fabric now but if you're someone that says you know you are thinking about fabric you're using Theriot magic to treat whatever you have and any type of weight of fabric it makes it a printable surface this was run through actually this is the paint sorry this is with a stencil so you can paint directly on to the surface like a stencil like this you can paint a perfect design and you can even run it when I said printable you can run it through your inkjet printer because it will go through because it has this rigidity to it there's no residue it's all-natural it's completely something that is non-toxic so if you were printing on say a gauze like this like on your inkjet printer you can put it on your Cricut this is a print than cut image in Cricut design space that has been printed and cut easily so can I ask you then let's say you were to use this make it into that more paper like material let's say you're running it through your die cutting machine but then you want it back to that fabric you know consistency you can do that right you rinse it just rinse it yes you just rinse it so it's an amazing experience so like I like to for me again back to the the full-on fabric origami type thing look at this it's an explosion card made with the fabric all right this is not paper its fabric it can be folded and kept in in the shape if you don't wash it out alright so then I have a lots to show you so even if you're thinking about working with fabric on your Cricut maker it now does no longer requires the the backing any of the cotton because once you've treated it with Theriot magic you can put it on the mat cuts it perfectly free free again I've made you know I made a card with it but you're you're you're absolutely transforming the way you think about fabric with this beautiful substance so what type of fabrics could we use it on I've got Susan asking on Facebook too she's saying I got a crocheted snowflake okay you know back back in the 80s my mom made these giant bows out of fabric that you put on baskets and we used a particular medium that turned yellow over time so this isn't going to yellow it's going to make like a fabric pinwheel you're able to transform a birthday party so you know a banner and bunting into something that is going to last it's going to hold its shape and you don't have to iron it it's amazing it's now rigid so this is a huge customer pick we actually have not seen this since July what you're getting today is normally forty one dollars and forty-five cents so it's been dropped down significantly keep in mind your entire crafting cart today will ship for a flat rate of five dollars no matter how much is in it and there's four flexible payments on this so $7.49 will get it home and as Anna's showing sky's the limit to what you can do to this now you're transforming your fabrics so if you can easier material if we were watching a lot of embroidery today right with with the the TS and a lot of times when you're doing embroidery you have to back the embroidery so with the Theriault magic you can actually embroider with the treated fabric without backing so you see the back of that it is completely ready to go thread painting again you can print directly on it for color printing you can create appliques without fraying so this is a this is a really nice companion to those of you that love to sew I like to paper crafts with it but again print it fabric piecing nothing's going to fray and again you can wash it completely I mean the reviews I read on this customer pick the ideas were crazy I mean I invite you to go there and take a look at how people love
