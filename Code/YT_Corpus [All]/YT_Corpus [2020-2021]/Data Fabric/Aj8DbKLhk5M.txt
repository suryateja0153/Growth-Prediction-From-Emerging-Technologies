 Hewlett Packard Enterprise, better known as HPE, announced last week that they're acquiring the business assets of MapR. In related news, a day later, Microsoft announced that it was teaming up with Informatica. At face value, HPE acquiring MapR and Microsoft partnering with Informatica both emphasize data handling and not analytics. Enterprise customers are more interested now in deep learning frameworks than Hadoop. MapR and Informatica started a relationship in 2012 to enable their joint customer bases to analyze streaming data with Hadoop. Our Take is that HPE's acquisition of MapR is focused on moving HPE's data management frameworks into alignment with modern containerized private and public cloud infrastructure. HPE has been focused so much on retaining on-prem business that it really lost sight of the cloud. The bigger question is whether companies like Cloudera, Informatica, and Teradata can now survive on their own caught between legacy on-prem IT providers like Dell and HPE, the public clouds, and SAP.
