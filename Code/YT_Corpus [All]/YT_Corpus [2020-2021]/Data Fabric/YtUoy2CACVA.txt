 block from Las Vegas it's the cube covering AWS reinvent 2019 brought to you by Amazon Web Services and Dan Kahl along with its ecosystem partners welcome back inside the sands we are in Las Vegas we are live here on the cube along with de Villante I'm John wall's we continue our coverage of AWS Raymond 2019 by welcoming in Eric Hallberg VP of cloud solutions and in fit of that Eric good to see you today thanks for joining us so share a little bit at home for the folks who might not be too familiar with infinite I know you guys bigger the in the in data storage in terms of what what's happening in the enterprise but shed a little bit of light on that for us yeah so infinite that's all about reinventing the next generation of data storage at multi petabyte scale and whether that's through our own firm appliances where we have over 5.4 exabytes deployed now around the world large enterprises or whether that's through our cloud services like Neutrik squad which we're talking a lot about today and through the conference we're solving large data challenges for customers with block or file storage requirements we're doing that through technology that gets the price point of hard drives with the performance capabilities of solid state media dram and flash and we're doing it at very large scale even though we kind of fly under the radar a bit from a marketing standpoint so there's a lot of interesting things going on rich storage demand there's no question that the cloud is eating away at some of the traditional on-prem and and there's very few companies that are gaining share rapidly you happen to be one of them you know pure storage grew 15 percent this quarter much much lower you know generally HPE shrinking I think Dell EMC grew a little bit you know iBM has been been down I don't think they've announced yet so you're seeing a couple of things cloud eating away and then all this injection of flash you're really the only guys who can make spinning disk run faster there as fast as flash every else is this throwing flash at the problem and that's created Headroom so what are you guys seeing cuz you're clearly growing you're you're a market share gainer you have the advantage of new and you know smaller talk about your business and how you're growing and why you're growing it's nothing but growth and it comes from this increase in the overall data that requirements that customers have and it comes from the economic aspects of that data fundamentally data storage is all about economics and we're able to deliver through our technical advantage of blending disk flash and DRAM an order of magnitude cost basis advantage and that translates into direct financial benefits that allow ultimately enterprises to do more with their data yeah that's what we're all about so as workload shift to the cloud there's an on-prem component we're gonna talk about cloud Multi cloud hybrid cloud etc but you got a product called new tricks talk about that and where it fits into this big macro trend that we just absolutely so new tricks fits into the broader landscape in a couple of ways first of all many of the clients that we deal with are large enterprises and they're in their relatively early stages of cloud transformation so new tricks provides an easy on-ramp for them to come from our best-in-class on prim infrastructure and make that data accessible in one or multiple clouds and that kind of maybe it's for test em maybe it's for a disaster recovery a pilot light scenario or a couple other use cases for general purpose primary data storage that's their on-ramp to then taking advantage of the more strategic value of new tricks which is allowing clouds to compete for the business on the compute side of things you can't hit a key word in there to fill might transform and we've talked about that a lot transformation versus transition in terms of storage capabilities enterprise storage capabilities whatever take us through that transformation if you will and not the transition and what what's the paradigm change what's going on in that space that's requiring people to make this dive into the deep end if you will and not just tickling the water with the toes well I think there's two elements to it there's a business and kind of a philosophical reorientation around taking advantage of flexible resources and allowing infrastructure to change over time and pay off X based business models that sort of stuff and getting comfortable with that honestly is a journey into of itself because many procurement organizations especially large organizations they don't know what to do with you know a monthly bill or an uncommitted reserve amount or things like that so part of it is is being able to walk with the customer as they transform on the on the business side of things and then the other side is accepting and going down the path of variable workloads being able to accommodate large varieties of mixed data environments and be agile on the technology side so that you can put the data where it needs to be with the performance that it needs to be and with the capabilities that it needs to be all right so we're pressed for time so I really want to get a few topics in it for infinite I see three main opportunities broadly one is on Prem stealing market share we talked about that a little bit too was this multi cloud thing and we'll talk about that as well if you're an on-prem company you got to have a multi cloud strategy and even if you're a pure cloud company you got to have a multi cloud strategy and the third is the cloud you've got to embrace the cloud if you deny the cloud you're denying the biggest Google Trends so let's start with the cloud what's your cloud strategy what's your relationship with AWS and how are you taking advantage of that so we're all about delivering our data services and whatever means whatever physical infrastructure whatever underlying business model the customer requires with that in mind we deliver new tricks cloud as a service for use with major public cloud environments including AWS and our relationship with AWS you know they recognize I think they would say that we bring access to large scale Tier one environments all around the world coming from our base on the on-prem and they're very interested in obviously working with the customers on cloud transformation at the scale that we operate as well so it's a mutually beneficial partnership we're proud to be an APN member and all of that so yeah I mean if you can put your stack in the AWS cloud which is what you're doing it's gonna drive other services right if it's gonna drive ml and sage makers and you know backup and all kinds of you know great things absolutely so the storage guys at AWS may not love you but everybody else at AWS is going to be happy because you're driving other services all right let's talk about multi cloud it's on it's it's obviously a controversial topic we've got John Ferrier every year does a exclusive interview with Andy Jesse he's on the record and I think he's right he says look it multi-cloud is going to be more complex less secure and more expensive he's right and he goes but he also recognizes that there are multiple clouds out there and so organizations have to participate in multi cloud strategies I I've predicted as as stoom in a man and John freer Amazon's gonna participate in that someday look at what they're doing in hybrid so Amazon looks at multi cloud is multiple public clouds and an on-prem as hybrid come back to infinity what's your multi cloud strategy so the great thing about our strategy is that we're able to deliver the same data in whatever public cloud environments the customer wants to deploy so we actually run our own independent infrastructure that sits just outside the walled gardens of all the major public clouds and then we can provide network connectivity using their direct connect interfaces or similar a private network interconnects all API driven customer doesn't have to think about the underlying infrastructure and fundamentally it allows them to subscribe to our storage as a service directly and whatever public clouds they choose and now let's let's talk about the on Prem piece of that which is the hybrid you know component using chassis sort of definitional framework you've got flex that extend your on-prem story talk about that a little bit absolutely so our customers are saying hey I want the the public cloud business model on the on Prem environment and flex is our answer to that kind of question so we deliver essentially Hardware independence price per gig per month we maintain title to the asset all that sort of stuff and we're in charge of refreshing the infrastructure every three years and we back it with a more than public cloud level availability guarantee hundred percent availability guarantee for the Flex business model we've seen companies flash pit base based based products as backup targets infinite at uses a combination of flash and spinning disk to keep cost down and you've you've got math magic to to make it as perform it one of the things I like what you're doing is you're partnering with I think most of if not all the backup software vendors and opening up new market opportunities and expanding your Tam by partnering with those guys talk a little bit about if you can give us some specifics there absolutely so for example we were presenting at the bean booth earlier this week about the intersection between at fini box and the VM backup software suite and we have similar capabilities with some of the other backup platforms as well so two sides to that one using the on pram or cloud environments as a source and there we have integrations with our snapshot technology specifically and then two using our infinii guard product on the on prim side as a target and there we have deep integration at an API level with the various backup platform so it's it's a cohesive universe where customers can take primary data they can put it on infinite OTT they can use whatever Enterprise backup platform they can also put it as a target on infinite technology and we're talking a lot about today what about tomorrow I mean what's the what's the bigger picture down the road what's your crystal ball telling you in terms of future complexities and challenges and what you see where this is headed I think from a storage standpoint at least obviously lots of other complexities beyond that universe but from a storage standpoint people want to stop thinking about infrastructure they want to think about cloud data services they want to think about essentially going from storage arrays to storage clouds we're doing that on on prim we're doing that in public cloud environments and we're knitting it all together with our initiative called the elastic data fabric our ultimate goal there and what we think customers really want is to be able to get the data services that they want at any given instant through the business model they care about independent of the underlying infrastructure and that's what we're set up to deliver over the next couple of years that definied I thank you for the time we appreciate that by the way eric has become a very important kubera v.i.c is six the parents are on the queue I wish we had a plaque or something to give you but about just an attaboy thanks back with more coverage here from AWS rain event 2019 and watching those live we're here on the cube
