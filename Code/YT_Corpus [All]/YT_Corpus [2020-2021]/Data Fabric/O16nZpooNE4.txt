 hello I'm Clark Ritchie I'm the chief technology officer and co-founder of fact gem fat gem connects data to provide business and government leadership the ability to answer questions that evolve faster than the current IT system can respond I have spent much of my career working with government agencies tackling some the largest most complex data challenges that exist today my role was to help them analyze their operational data challenges and to come up with innovative solutions inevitably the solution lies the combination of systems modernization re-platforming and digital transformation these are all rational and ultimately good investments however the problem is he'll only take to finish if they finish at all and how much money is spent on engineering resources whether you're a business leader at a retail health care or financial services firm or a military or police commander there's constant frustration from not being able to pull key concepts out of data that is seemingly everywhere erp supply chains CRM human resources and hundreds or thousands of spreadsheets I believe that leadership stuff tools that require a little to no engineering support to deploy and maintain are understandable to business leaders deploy in hours or days not months or years and allow organizations to answer hard questions about their data that's why I co-founded fact gem and created a tool that allows leaders to create and deploy a business model these ideas may seem somewhat outlandish and I can totally understand if you're skeptical so let me explain how we do what we do if your organization is anything like the ones I've helped not only is data spread all over the place and different applications and systems it's usually broken up into tables that rip context from content this is the exact opposite of a business view of data so the first thing users can do with fact gem has simply draw circles and lines representing the key entities and relationships for their particular business fat jam white order allows you to create this conceptual data model without having to ingest and integrate data first stay close engage in this and immediately start seeing shortcomings in the way they currently organized and aggregate their critical data and how slight changes can improve customer service business visibility drive revenue or boost mission effectiveness the model is complete with entity properties and business data logic back gem mapper allows customers to load data that populates these entities and relationships making the conceptual model physical fact gem harvester allows you to rapidly import external sources of data and connect them to your organization's data extending your ability to gather data centric insights in fact your monitor puts all this into action by automating the ingestion of data for all of your sources suddenly with all of their information expressed and easy to understand business concepts factional customers can use their favorite bi and reporting tools such as micro strategy or tableau to integrate these entities and relationships or move it into algorithmic analysis with data science AI or machine learning environments underlying all of this is the fact gem data fabric the fact gem data fabric connects data from platforms and applications separated by purpose geography or organization into a unified service enabled graph endpoint stored as a cohesive and visual model data from across the enterprise expressed as entities relationships transactions and events that tie them together providing for easy query reporting and visualization even though we focus on getting to business interests in the here and now the factum data fabric will complement your organization's IT modernization transformation and rhe platforming by making your entities and relationships plain to see at fact gem we say that seeing is believing everyday we help business leaders ask the hardest questions of data that they knew they had but couldn't get to for more information about fact gem or to schedule a demo email us at seeing is believing at fact gem calm or check out WWF at gem calm
