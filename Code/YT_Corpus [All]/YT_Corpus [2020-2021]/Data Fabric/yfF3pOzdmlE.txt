 [Music] thank you for coming and attending this session you've chosen the best session it next to sit in on my name is Joe kava I'm the vice president of global data centers at Google what that means is that I helped to lead the teams that are responsible for the end-to-end lifecycle of our data centers from the very beginning stages of site selection and location strategy to procuring all of our energy contracts including our renewable energy to design construction and full operations of the data centers all around the world I've been at Google just over eleven years and I've had the pleasure of working with amazing people and seeing incredible technology evolve so today I'm gonna try and give you a little bit of a insider's view into our data centers what makes them special what I really appreciate about our data centers and as a clue it has a little something to do with sustainability you probably saw this on their screen as you entered the room we're using a tool first time at at next it's called dory it's an internal tool that we use at Google for all of our large meetings like this so feel free to open up the tool onion on the app and you can submit questions and upload other questions and I'm gonna try and leave time here at the end so that we can address them and we'll also have mics open for live questions if you'd like okay so let's start with a little bit of an examination of what do you need from a data center um well if you're like me and I suspect most of you are you you know you need your data center to be very high performance you need it to be highly available you need it in places where you need to be you needed to be extremely reliable needs to be ultra secure and if you can wrap that up with a bow of sustainability then you've got something that is really meeting all your needs in a data center since the earliest days of when I got to Google and actually long before I was there for about two decades now Google has been the leaders in ultra high performance computing systems one of the things that impressed me when I first arrived was that even as innovative as the data centers were I remember the very first day that I was at a Google Data Center and everyone kind of wonders what a day to senators like at Google I did to when I got there I was kind of tracing the path of the electrons in my mind and I was just shaking my head and and my manager asked me is something wrong and I said no it's just so obvious I don't know why everyone isn't doing it but what impressed me most is that no matter how good we're doing we always believe we can do better so we have a relentless focus on innovation and constant technology evolution so ultra high performance what does that mean well for us it means that we don't rely on just off-the-shelf components we design and build almost every part of the stack custom built for us for ultra high computing ultra high efficiency at the price and end performance that we need it to be so this is everything from our custom designed high-voltage substations that are on the campus of all of our data centers to the server's themselves the racks that the servers go in the custom-designed cooling solutions at those racks mate - - even the way we operate the cooling plants I'll touch on that a little bit more but it as I mentioned it truly is just a relentless focus on continual improvement and constant innovation so as I mentioned these are built for Google there's no unnecessary components in our servers they're stripped down just ultra high performance computers this reduces vulnerabilities as you know we have a very very strong focus on security so all of our servers have our built-in Titan chip from the time that they're manufactured for us to our specifications and that Titan chip is helping to secure every server throughout its entire lifecycle at Google all of our services are dynamically allocated we talked a lot about this our board system which we have been using internally at Google since the earliest days that eventually became the orchestration layer for all of our our containers and so we are constantly provisioning and upgrading and redoing our infrastructure in since we're constantly upgrading and changing it has to be very flexible and adaptable so we put a high priority on optionality I'll talk a little bit more what that means has to be extremely efficient ability to scale and our data centers also are compliant with the Open Compute program the racks that are available through that so why is that important well it just means that we're leveraging the rest of the data center ecosystem as well not just relying on on what we do we also have our own teams that are staffing the data centers in particular our Hardware operations teams that are there 24/7 at our data centers they are doing all of our deployments maintenance upgrades repairs of all of the hardware all the servers storage and network in the data centers they're there in real time so they respond very quickly they have all the tools necessary to make their job very efficient and they are highly reliable and do this all the time so we're not relying on an SLA with a service provider to come in and service the data centers we do that ourselves since I've been at Google we have constantly been innovating and Cooling why is that important well data centers consume a lot of energy and in a data center one of the largest overhead components is related to the air conditioning or the cooling of the data center so we have innovated our cooling systems about every 18 months since the time that I've been at Google we've used a variety of cooling techniques we use sea water in Finland we bought a paper mill turned it into a big data center campus and it actually was sitting right on the Gulf of Finland so we were looking at that water that was about 14 degrees Celsius all year round and said we can use that so that data center is 100% cooled by sea water we use reclaimed and storm water in a data center in the southeast of the United States we built a storm water capture and reuse system so we're cooling the data center with storm water there in Belgium were sited right next to a big industrial shipping canal so we use the industrial shipping canal water kind of the point is you see where I'm going with this we don't have a cookie cutter design we don't have a one-size-fits-all model we optimize the designs of the data center for that specific location for the environment that it's working in to make most use of the natural resources that are there okay so that's what you need from a data center but you also have to consider where the data centers are you need them in the right locations they have to kind of meet you where you need to be so we have a very large footprint of data centers we have 16 global campuses when I talk about a campus a campus to us is typically hundreds of acres with many buildings many data center buildings on each campus all connected by one of the world's largest mostly Hyatt most high performance public networks available we have 19 regions for our cloud compute we have 58 availability zones there 134 points of presence we are in over 2 hundred countries around the world all interconnected with hundreds of thousands of miles of fiber including 13 of our own subsea cables making us really the largest overall compute infrastructure of any of the any of the major players okay so even long before cloud computing was a large business for us we had been building this infrastructure for a couple decades to service our own needs to service you know Gmail in search and ads and all of the the you know YouTube and all of the Google services so we have been building this infrastructure and we learned how to scale and we learned how to build efficiently for our own internal needs what that means is that we have eight products currently that each are serving over a billion active customers a day it's a lot of learning that came with that and all of that gets applied to Google cloud so they're benefiting from two decades of learning of how to scale how to build how to do things hyper efficiently so where are our data centers well we have data centers campuses on four continents North America South America Asia and Europe of course we pick the sites based on a rigorous time-tested site selection criteria we take input from our internal customers cloud is one of our largest customers now dictating a lot of where they want to be to serve the customers and meet you where you are so with that we look for things that we can more or less build into for the next decade or so so our strategy is that we want to find sites that we can be building at and building up for about 10 years or more there's a long list of criteria a lot of people always ask me you know how do you choose the datacenter site and if I were to quote the head of our site selection team he would probably say it's more or less the art of compromise because there is no one site that meets a hundred percent of every single thing we would love so we try and find the best compromise but what that means is that we wind up like this site here is in Belgium we wind up with a large parcel of land that we can build multiple data centers on for many years to come and that gives us access to our customers gives us access to a workforce gives us access to high quality fiber and more importantly every day gives us access to renewable energy this particular data center is in Iowa this is in our central region this is the first part of the parcel that we developed this part of the parcel is 300 acres the overall site is about three times that size if you were to measure this out this fits about 235 American football fields on this part that's the developed part we have another two parcels that we could develop that are equally this large you'll see in the foreground here that that that small building that's a one-story datacenter that building is about a third of a mile long and then behind it you see the data center that's a little taller that's a two-story data center also a third of a mile long and then the ones that you see that are being built behind that those are four-story data centers also will be about a third of a mile long when completed the amount of capacity here is staggering and it provides a good exercise opportunity for our teams that are at the site they can just jog around the perimeter and do about almost three miles of jogging just to go around the buildings right now okay so you've got the what you need you got the where you need it but what about how well you need it available all the time if you caught the keynote this morning by ORS he mentioned that unsolicited by Google not commissioned by us at all but an independent industry analyst said that by far Google Cloud has the lowest downtime of any of the major cloud providers that's not by accident it's because of the way that we design build and operate our data centers and when we say seven by 24 by 365 we really mean that the design principle of our data centers is to be fault tolerant and allow us to maintain the data centers transparent to all of you what that means is that you know look you can hope that things don't break but I'm here to tell you things break when they do break you shouldn't care because it should be transparent to you so that means we have to do maintenance and we have to do upgrades and repairs while the data center is still alive so we build in the ability to to one make it fault tolerant and to make it concurrently maintainable we also build in hooks I talked a little bit earlier about our our value of optionality what that means is that you know we don't have a crystal ball I don't know exactly what we're gonna need from our data center a few years from now I don't know what the latest generation of platforms that are gonna be developed are but we want to add in the hooks that allow us to accommodate for whatever our platform's development team comes up with one example is when we built our first data centers we didn't know about the TPU systems that were developed for our ml and AI applications however we were able to accommodate those and even the latest generation that requires water cooling at the chip level we were able to accommodate that because we had built in the hooks to allow us to do those types of things in the future so really what the idea there is that we're looking to the future and were we're planning to be able to accommodate whatever the requirements are and from our operations team one of our core principles is on continuous learning continuous improvement and what that means is transparency if you make a mistake you can't hide it people make mistakes it's okay we have kind of a no blame policy because we just want to learn from what happened and it's typical in the industry that of all the data center failures still about 70 percent of all data center failures today are related to some form of human error at Google ours are much less it's a little bit over 15% that are related to some sort of human error however because of our designs because we don't expect perfection we designed for them to be tolerant of mistakes and what that means is that even though there were 15% of the errors that were human related none of them resulted in downtime with the data centers that's also quite different from the industry average in order to help our teams manage the data centers we have to monitor everything you might say that we're a little bit data obsessed so we are monitoring every aspect of the data centers from the server's themselves monitoring temperatures and air pressures and flow rates and in the mechanical cooling yard the the flow rates and differential pressures of the the cooling systems on the electrical side everything from the high voltage substation all the way down to the the server level is monitored and of course security all of our security systems all of our multi-layer security systems so these are all monitored truly we have world-class monitoring from chip all the way to chiller and that enables our teams to understand what's going on so that they can best operate maintain and repair the data centers okay speaking of security data centers have to be ultra secure and ours are ultra secure there is a recent CBRE study that said that still one of the highest priorities in site selection for where to place their their equipment in a data center is based on the security profile of the data center so we take that very seriously we employ a kind of a defense-in-depth type of a strategy for physical security at the data centers that means that from the very outer perimeter you know around a campus that's hundreds of acres large there's already barriers in fencing to prevent people from just wandering in and the closer you get to the data center itself the higher the security the more rigid the the the policies are and what all this means is that out of all the data centers around the world less than 2% of Googlers have ever set foot in one of our data centers and that's done by design because protecting the data and the information and the privacy of our users is at the foremost of our design criteria for the data centers so unless you have a job that requires you to be at the data center to perform that job you don't go to the data centers it's just that strict so I talked about our physical security but truly physical security and information security have to go hand-in-hand it's part of the same design criteria however our information security team are separate from my team and that is done by design because one they truly are the world's experts in in protecting information security it's a very large team they've been published and written books on security principles and all that and truly they need to be standalone and it's also for governance because you want the the two teams to be little checks and balances on each other so as I said on the physical security side we use a multi-layered strategy to get into the data center itself you have to have a badge that authorizes you to be there and that's tied to your credentials of course then we have biometric authentication which is pretty typical but then we have a lot of other layers of security that are not seen so we know who is in the data centers where they are we know what they've touched why they did it what actions they took so that we have complete end-to-end traceability of everything that's happening in the data centers this is a quote from data center knowledge that basically it's just summarizing what I've been saying is that data center security measures are built into pretty much every single layer of the system from the data center itself the building the security principles the security designs all the way down to the server's themselves and our custom security chips built into the servers okay now we know what you want what you need from a data center we know how you need it where you need it so we've covered most of the reasons but what if you could wrap all this up with sustainability also more and more our customers are telling us that they have their own corporate mandates around sustainability and energy use and renewable energy purchases so we have been focused on sustainability for long before I came to Google we were the first company to achieve a zero carbon footprint and I'll talk a little bit more about that but really our sustainability efforts are broken into three kind of pillars if you will energy efficiency because truly the best use of energy is the energy you don't use in the first place so we've been laser focused on energy efficiency at the data centers second our use of renewable energy to power the data centers I'll get into a lot more detail about that and lastly our commitment to a circular environment and our philosophy of a zero waste to landfill and I'll talk more about that as well so as I said the best energy saved is the energy not consumed in the first place Google Data Centers are without a doubt some of the most efficient in the world what that means is that compared to a traditional enterprise data center a Google Data Center consumes about half of the energy that a traditional enterprise data center would and at the same time we're delivering seven times more compute power at our data centers today than we were just five years ago so what that means is that that's a lot more Gmail a lot more search a lot more YouTube cap videos and a lot bigger cloud for the same energy footprint as just a few years ago as a matter of fact one measure of energy efficiency in the data centers is a very simple metric called PUA most of you have probably heard of it it's a very simple ratio it's the total energy consumed at the data center divided by the IT energy used and so everything else is overhead so it's a ratio that generally measures you know something above one and most average data centers are still about one point five eight what that means is they have 58% overhead our data centers have 11 percent overhead and this is a trailing 12-month average across the fleet of every single one of our data centers around the world this is not cherry-pick this is not our best data center this is across the entire fleet and it's been that way a long time but we didn't just rest on making energy efficient data centers and building energy efficient computing systems we then decided to try and make better use of the data that we're getting from our data centers one of our engineers came up with the idea that said if we could build a machine learning algorithm to analyze these volumes of data that we're gathering every day at the data centers maybe we could find some insights that would help us drive the energy efficiency even further that's exactly what he did and then he partnered with our deep mind group to basically make it production worthy we employed that and now we have the full ML system operating parts of our cooling systems at the data center fully autonomously very safely and of the energy consumption for the cooling we've achieved about a 30% reduction in the energy consumption for cooling by having the ml system operate the data center cooling system for us the way it does that it's very simple it's looking at about 19 to 20 independent variables in real-time and it's matching the cooling needs to the data center load at that time so it's doing it in real-time and it's constantly adjusting and this is basically far more efficient than humans could do it and so we developed it we tested it over many years and little by little we made it fully autonomous so now it's controlling the data center cooling as I talked about we have a strong commitment to powering the data centers on renewable energy so we started our renewable energy in our zero carbon journey roughly in about 2007 when we decided that as a company we were going to achieve zero carbon footprint and we did achieve that in 2007 and we did that primarily by buying very high quality carbon offsets so we were just offsetting our carbon footprint and we did that for 10 years and in 2017 we apart from celebrating the 10 year anniversary of being carbon neutral company we also announced that we had achieved another major milestone and that was that we are now buying enough renewable energy to offset the entire consumption of energy at Google Data Centers and Google overall the entire enterprise what does that mean that means that we are the world's largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy we have since 2000 roughly 10 ish we have signed over 30 large-scale Power Purchase Agreements for solar and wind energy that is over three and a half gigawatts of energy under contract so we are now matching for every kilowatt or megawatt hour of energy we consume around all of Google we are now buying at least an equal amount of renewable energy and we are the first company of our skies to ever achieve 100% matching of our consumption versus renewable this is a little bit of our journey when we started in 2007 frankly I should have put down this slide when I was just saying all that stuff but um anyhow like I said we now have over three and a half gigawatts under contract we've spent over five billion dollars on these energy purchase agreements in 2017 as I mentioned we had 10 consecutive years of carbon neutrality and we matched 100% of our consumption but as I talked about we don't rest on our laurels and so even that is not good enough for us because in order for us to truly take responsibility for energy footprint and our impact to the environment and the climate we need to be able to match our energy consumption with renewable energy 24 hours a day seven days a week as you know some of the grids in which we operate don't have abundant renewable energy on them in some places the regulatory environment doesn't allow you to go out and purchase your own renewable energy contracts so in order to achieve that we're gonna have to come up with some creative thinking so the team's been doing that and one of the demonstrations of this is that in Taiwan where the regulatory environment previously had not allowed corporate companies to go out and buy their own energy contracts and put it on the grid there in Taiwan so we worked with the Taiwan Power Company and the Taiwan national government and over a period of time of collaborating with them we were able to get the Taiwan Power Act changed that allows us to pie to buy renewable energy contracts and put it on the grid in Taiwan so our first one that we did is pretty unique these are kind of fish ponds where they the fish farm they raise fish in these ponds right so we have a developer that is now building solar panels above these these fish ponds so now we have a solar pond or solar farm above a fish farm and that's what we're in it's right in the same local area as where I datacenter is so that is helping us to green our operations in Taiwan and and helping us basically take more accountability for our consumption in that local region so this is the first of a kind in Taiwan and by the way when we make these agreements we don't do it just for us we make the policy so that anyone that wants to follow our actions can do that also another example in Belgium we did this this solar farm this is about 10,000 solar panels on our data center property normally we would do these off-site where we could have larger installations but in this case this was a great way to match or offset our energy consumption for our office areas and our facilities not the data center itself that would be too large however in another part in the southeast of the United States in Tennessee and Alabama we worked with the Tennessee Valley Authority to build one of the largest ppas that has ever been done in that region that's 1.5 million solar panels 413 megawatts that are being built specifically for Google that will offset our consumption in that region for the foreseeable future so we're gonna have to work hard to actually make this a reality 24 by 7 renewable energy as you know like I said renewable energy is not available everywhere in the world it's not available every day or every hour of the day the Sun doesn't shine 24 hours a day the wind doesn't blow 24 hours a day so we're gonna have to get very creative with this we've developed a tool that allows us to analyze at a data center level the consumption of the data center and match it to what the renewable energy generation is our for our so that we can see how we're doing in some data centers in parts of the world where we don't have a lot of access to renewable energy it's not matched very well yet in other parts we're over 65 percent matching today already so we have a long way to go but we were we think it's important enough to dedicate a team of resources to this initiative and it's a long-term goal I don't know when we're gonna achieve it it is arguably a moonshot typical Google thinking but but in order to really take accountability for our footprint this is what we have to do this is as I mentioned this happens to be the data center in North Carolina showing how on a day hour by hour basis we're matching with our renewable energy so you can see that in some parts of the year we are 82 percent carbon free other parts of the year we're 49 percent carbon free so it changes a course seasonally an hour-by-hour but this is giving us the insights that we need the really cool thing that we did remember that that ml system I told you about that was operating our data center cooling sis well deepmind and us partnered together to adjust that system and said what if we apply that same type of machine learning to a wind farm what would that do well we developed jointly a new ML system that allows us to predict what the energy generation of a wind farm will be 36 hours in advance why is that really important because if you're a grid operator the intermittency of renewables make it really hard for you to plan how much generation you need you know what your demand is gonna be more or less because you've got a long history of looking at your your demand from your customers but you don't know what the output of that wind farm is gonna be tomorrow well this ml system allows us to predict it with high degree of fidelity what it is so now they can plan on that and put that into their base load calculations we can better utilize the full output of the wind farm which has resulted now that you know the early days I don't know if this is going to be how it is always I hope it's better but we've already achieved about a 20 percent improvement in the value of the wind farm that this was done at the value of that that renewable energy so I think there's a lot of a lot of Hope here ok and the third pillar is the circular economy and our belief is that we should reuse and recycle and have a zero waste to landfill goal we have achieved zero waste to landfill at some of our data centers but not all of them today across the entire portfolio were 91% diversion of waste to landfill that means that we only nine percent of all of our waste whether it's from construction or operations is making it to a landfill this required us to think about things differently to come up with better reuse strategies so that we can take components that maybe aren't used for that particular customer but use them for another internal customer like for instance if search said those those machines are kind of out of date for us but some of our other you know internal services can still use them so rather than just you know recycle them we're reusing a lot of that we're remanufacturing a lot of our servers with with recycled components and we're reselling some of our components as well so that we're really diverting a lot of that otherwise what would be electronic waste and it's not just us talking about it but a lot of other people have noticed our sustainability efforts so we've been at the top of the the CDP awards list for many years we were given the Zayed future energy award in Abu Dhabi a couple of years ago so it's being noticed it's not just we're doing it for ourselves but we're doing it for all of you all of our customers as well because now you know that the workloads that you run in in Google cloud are helping you achieve your own sustainability and your own carbon neutrality initiatives so this is a quote here from one of our customers Etsy their CTO said that underneath their ecological goal they want to be a hundred percent renewable electricity by 2020 and that they know that all of their workloads that they're processing with us on Google cloud are helping them to achieve this initiative because they are already being powered by renewable energy on our our cloud so if we review our core principles or core principles for our data center program our around performance availability reliability security and an environmental responsibility and a commitment to a hundred percent sustainability we truly are building the world's most sustainable cloud [Music]
