 [Music] [Music] creating a digital human for us is really understanding ourselves understanding how we look how we move and in the future hopefully how we think imagining all kinds of applications of this technology is just overwhelming collecting data is part of our DNA from day one limitations in the first days were everywhere the size of my disk drive back then I think it was 1.3 gigabytes and now were capturing 70 gigabytes a second it just takes so much data in order to build a model that is robust enough to do something meaningful we have hardware which can acquire huge amounts of data then we have software which can analyze this data and that third set of technologies can synthesize new data comparing the synthetic back to reality so it's always about more data but also about the way to understand that data we know that the density of the data will increase but the cube power and data will probably only spike whatever entry considering how to scale up to cover those pipes we made this informed decision to switch to meta data fabric is definitely our gateway to the cloud that's how we switch from local into much more global computer we're hoping that we are going to develop a framework where people whether that's in medical or biometrics or entertainment or research well each in their own field be able to use that framework and create something amazing I'm Vladimir mr.
