 (bright music) Cyber threats are everywhere and they are constantly changing. The challenge for Chief Security Officers, IT and security teams is enabling security at the speed of digital transformation. These teams must also ensure that security and trust span every digital process, customer experience and service across every layer of the technology. Sound impossible? Not when you work with the security experts at HPE. We start by building zero-trust security, into everything from silicon to data and apps across people, processes and technology, and from the edge to the cloud. We call this security and resiliency by design and all of our reference architectures adhere to that critical philosophy. Zero-trust security assumes a breach will occur so businesses should prepare by following best practices, such as DevSecOps and others. Doing so integrate security earlier in new initiatives and aligns them with industry standards, such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. HPE Pointnext Services offer greater protection of customer data, earlier detection of threats and the ability to recover faster from a disaster, breach or data loss for business continuity. Trust HPE experts and HPE GreenLake Cloud Services to help accelerate security in your hybrid cloud and at the edge. Train your teams and manage security across your technology platforms.
