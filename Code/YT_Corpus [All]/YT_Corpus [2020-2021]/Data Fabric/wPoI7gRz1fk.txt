 hey guys here's a list of some new minecraft mods which are all relatively new these work on both forge and fabric mod loaders and i tested them all out using minecraft 1.16.4 all the links to the mods as well as to my shaders can be found in the description below workshops of doom will add a few new structures to your world which are all ran and maintained by illagers currently there are queries mines and workshops with the workshops being the biggest of the three illagers have started leaving their outposts and expanding out into the world to harvest its natural resources as you venture through each structure you'll come across plenty of illagers to fight and tons of loot to collect trident return is a small quality of life mod which will force the trident to return to the inventory slot it was thrown from that way you don't have to worry about having to scroll through your hot bar again name tags are great to have but are quite rare to find craftable name tag recipe will allow you to create your own name tags by combining a piece of paper string and a slab inside of a crafting table [Music] grey goo is a strange mod that will cause some blocks that you walk on to randomly become infected and turn into gray goo blocks once that happens it will start to slowly spread to other nearby blocks slowly spreading throughout your world these blocks act like sand and gravel with how they fall one way this mod could be useful is for trying to complete the game before the grey goo can ruin it the dynamaxx is a new type of tool which acts as an axe and it's also compatible with biomes of plenty when used it will cause all logs above that target block to break allowing you to destroy trees fairly quickly although it will let off a slight explosion so you'll take a small amount of damage if you're standing too close it isn't cheap to craft either requiring two sticks three diamonds and three tnt whale breeding will add a new passive animal to your minecraft world which is the quail like chickens they lay eggs and you could breed them using seeds or throw the quail eggs to have a small chance of spawning a baby this mod includes some new food items which will require quail drops of course which will allow you to create the likes of fried eggs pickled eggs and cooked quail they can even be replaced with regular eggs as a crafting ingredient for cake when it comes to do items there's the quail jail which has both single use and reusable versions this item allows you to pick up your quails so you can easily transport them the quail meter can be used to provide important information such as the breed of a quail the egg laying amount and the amount of time left until an egg is laid the voider can collect items from hoppers or droppers and destroy them which can help deal with overflowing items whaleness can hold quails as long as you deposit them through a quail jail and will collect all the drops and deposit them into a nearby hopper whereas racks are new storage options which provide many more slots than chest at their highest tier this next mod will add some elemental arrows which are inspired by zelda straight into minecraft the mod is a work in progress but the developer has a lot planned for future updates currently there are four new aero types fire arrows will set entities on fire and also cause the surrounding blocks to catch fire if you're not careful the fire can spread pretty quickly too giving the opposite effect is ice arrows which will freeze entities in place for a few seconds these arrows will also spawn ice blocks inside of water and cobblestone when fired at lava shock arrows can be used to stun enemies although i find them to be mostly useful when fired into water as they'll damage any nearby enemies in a small radius finally there's the bomb arrows which as you might expect will spawn an explosion on impact and will also set fire to nearby blocks vanilla tweaks already exist as a forge mod but it's recently been ported over to fabric it adds a few new tweaks which aim to enhance minecraft some of the changes include new recipes which allow you to craft name tags turn mool into string or create packed ice a few new items are also added with some of the most noteworthy ones being binoculars which allow you to zoom into your world dynamite which is basically throwable tnt and a portable crafting table allowing you to quickly craft while on the move some of the new tweaks include baby zombies and creepers burning in sunlight the ability to edit already place signs and allowing the collection of spawners using a silk touch pickaxe there are many more features included with this mod which can all be found on the wiki icarus will add some wings to your world all of which will have crafting recipes they work the same way as the elytra where you will continuously glide and be able to propel yourself with rockets this mod will rely on the trinkets mod which will give access to the new cape inventory slot netherrite items will add seven new items to minecraft eating another right apple will provide regeneration and resistance effects which should help keep you alive whereas using the netherrite bow and arrow will increase your overall damage but also provide the piercing and blindness buffs the two new magic items which are the wand and staff will allow you to teleport to a target location or shoot out large fireballs at your enemies netherride horse armor is stronger than diamond and resistant to lava and finally the netherright rabbit foot will allow you to quickly leap in a direction of your choice which has a very short cooldown sword blocking will allow you to block attacks with your sword instead of a shield a mechanic which was previously removed in minecraft 1.9 as long as you have a shield equipped in your off hand slot you can block enemy attacks with your sword by holding down the right mouse button and the shield will remain invisible everything is infested probably won't be very useful in your minecraft world when installed any block that you break will cause silverfish to spawn which normally only happens when you break infested blocks although this mod would add a serious layer of difficulty when trying to beat the game lava sponges are new blocks which can be crafted by combining four sponge four basalt and one ancient debris inside a crafting table it works like regular sponges but will soak up lava instead when you mine a filled lava sponge it will be wet and will be needed dried out before you can use it again which can be done by placing it in the overworld blast proof netherrite will keep all your netherrite items safe not only will they be protected from lava and fire but now they'll also be protected from the likes of tnt and creeper explosions riptide is an enchantment for the trident which allows the player to fly through the air but it only works when the player is in water or it's raining the cauldron riptide mod allows you to use the enchantment when you're also standing inside of a cauldron finally there's the replay mod which has been updated to work with fabric replay is very useful as it makes a recording of your world as well as all the players inside it which you can watch from the main menu there are plenty of built-in tools such as event markers keyframes and more that's it for this list if you enjoyed the video leave a like and subscribe to stay up to date on my future content you
