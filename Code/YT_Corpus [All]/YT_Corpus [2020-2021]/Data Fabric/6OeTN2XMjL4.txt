 It's not a technical barrier. It's about people barrier. I've seen both models. I have seen highly centralized centres of excellence in some insurance companies where they wanted to really control and manage data science and AI and ML projects. However, I've also seen very decentralized situations. But the key is not to delegate the value of all this work to a data scientist or any other technical person, but to have the business people right there with them because it's the business outcome that matters. I know that sounds obvious but data science without business judgment is just random experimentation. And so even the data scientist is will welcome business context, business goals, prioritization of the types of data and outcomes that are being tried because then you can narrow your hypothesis. You can try things and know if you're successful or not. So it's people as much as it is technology just as it has always been.
