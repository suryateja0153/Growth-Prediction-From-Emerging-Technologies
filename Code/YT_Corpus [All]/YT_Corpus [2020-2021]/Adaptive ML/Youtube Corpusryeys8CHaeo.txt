 hello everybody my wife drives a certified  pre-owned 2014 E350 which started giving   her some trouble around 76,000 miles while  it was still under the extended warranty.   From time to time it would not shift from  reverse to drive and on other occasions it   would not shift from drive to park. This problem  occurred intermittently and not very frequently.   Since the car was in its last month of factory  warranty I wanted to make sure the dealer resolved   the problem or at least recorded the complaint.  Of course because the problem was intermittent,   the dealer was unable to find any issues  nor were they able to duplicate the problem.   Fast forward four months and three thousand miles  and the problem occurs three times in four days.   I drop my car on a Tuesday morning pick up my  loaner and tell them keep my car until they can   find the problem. The following Monday I received  this text message showing $1,220 for the repair   and you can see my gentle pushback. Here's my  final bill. Somehow $1,220 got down to $756 value,   probably the dealer cost and zero out of pocket  for me. I draw your attention to this safety   recall notice. It happens to apply to the 213  chassis whereas mine was a 212 chassis but if   you google 2017020018 you'll be able to find this  recall. While this recall does not apply to the   W212 chassis, it might help you plead your case  if you're having this problem on your E-class.   So thanks for watching.
