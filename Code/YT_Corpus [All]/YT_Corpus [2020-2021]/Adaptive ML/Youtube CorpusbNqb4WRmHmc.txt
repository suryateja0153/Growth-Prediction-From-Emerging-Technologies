 hi everybody and welcome to this virtual build session focused on conversational AI powered customer and employee virtual assistants my name is Gary pretty I will be the moderator for this session and we do have the availability for you to leave questions in the chat which I'd really encourage you to do and I'm going to save some of them for the end for our speaker and some of them will be answered during the session and without further ado I'm going to get right on over to of my colleague Daren Gephart for the session over do you go welcome everyone and good evening from the UK so great to have you here for this session we've got a lot of content to cover in just 20 minutes so apologies now I'm gonna move quickly to cover your everything that the BA framework team is announcing a build I will kick off the session with a quick intro to bot framework for those of you that are less familiar a quick update on some of the headlines of our release this week we're then gonna do a pretty complex end-to-end demo we're gonna show pretty much everything that we're announcing this week in one end-to-end demo and then quickly have a call to action that will give you all the bits that you can get started with right away after the session so let's get started very quickly the conversation AI platform and Microsoft we start from the bottom the bot framework is our software development kit instead of tools for building conversational experiences at Microsoft and that underpins everything we do at compare with conversation at Microsoft we then how these your bot service which takes your conversation experience and will surface it to your users through a variety of conversational canvases think of a canvas as Microsoft team's web chat facebook Messenger Alexa Google assistant we then have a layer of democratized AI services the cognitive services platform of which language understanding the intent of your question and pulling out the entities is the most important capability and speech increasingly we're seeing a lot of speech-enabled experiences we then have a solution accelerator The Verge assistant which you'll see which helps bring these things together and helps you build a more sophisticated assistant and that you focus on your particular scenario and you're seen and heard about power virtual agents all built on this same stack as well and you'll see how this is integrating at the end we're seeing fantastic momentum you've seen I think in almost every keynote kind of calling out to where the bot framework has been helping power a number of Microsoft products but also our customers you know in this you know difficult time with cope it 19 we have a number of those health providers with health bots ok using our platform as well as companies like Universal Electronics and Walgreens and Kroger who are building these customer facing experiences as well as healthcare experiences and also enterprise assistance that help employees who are working remotely we've seen fantastic growth a hundred and twenty percent increase in as your bot service daily messages 18 million new health care bot users and a fantastic increase in speech transcription now it's been great to see the platform's scale to this new demand with conversational AI so let's get into some of the things that are new so there's a brand new version of the bot framework the 4.9 version so a new version of the SDK and tooling and we're really pleased to announce the bot framework composer that you'll see a lot about in this presentation this does conversational design tool enabling professional developers to really lean in and deliver much more sophisticated experiences which you'll see a bit later on so a lot in there and also bringing capabilities like language generating an adaptive dialogues to be generally available the bot framework virtual system reaches the 1.0 ga release for those of you that are familiar we're also you'll see in the session showing off some previews of composer based skills and we can show what we can now do that we couldn't do before but also that ability to compose dialogues built with composer declarative dialogues with this waterful dialogues for those of you they've already invested so you can bring those together Q&A maker you'll see a lot of this multi-turn capabilities rich text editing and and also a much sought after feature around role based access control Louis has a fantastic new labeling experience anyone that's had to label most complex utterances will really benefit from the new labeling experience and you can see a highlight of that there only is your pod service we have a public preview of the Elector channel which is great to have there in public preview forum as well as more networking capabilities through the direct line app service extension and really exciting human handoff capabilities as well so we're gonna go straight into a demo now and really get into kind of showing kind of all these pieces working together so again we're gonna cover a lot of base we're gonna a lot of bases and they'll be follow-up recordings pre-recorded sessions we can get into more detail so this is the composer tool within the web browser there's also an electron app version as well which will be a likely place for a lot of you to start and in here you can go ahead and create new projects I'm just going to jump straight into a demo of the latest got a preview of the virtual assistant template so I'm going to go ahead and kind of open up this project and before I show it to you inside of composer I'm going to click this button to test it directly within the bot framework emulator which many of you will be familiar with and right away you see this assistant experience which is the out-of-the-box experience I've not done anything to customize this it's introducing itself as you would imagine with with many of these experiences now if I go ahead and refresh the introduction and i coming back multiple times you're gonna see the text here is changing it says hi right now and it says hi there hey there that variation is language generation we've got a much more sophisticated way of allowing people to provide the the copy the responses for a bot and you can provide multiple variations and templating parameterization makes them much more of a natural experience if you watch carefully throughout you'll see this color coming to life so you can see it's guiding me through to get started very simple can I get started flow here let's asking me my name to be to better personalize the experience so I'm gonna go ahead and say well actually I don't want to give you my name you know why do you need my name now notice asking for my name I don't want it to take why do you need my name as my name and what we're gonna see here is actually interruption we've gone ahead and said okay you've triggered this why intend and it's explaining what it's gonna do with the name and why and I'm gonna go ahead and actually give it my name now if I say I don't want to it would actually skip that as well so I can go ahead and go ahead and say Darin and again pleased to meet you seeing language generation there as well nice adaptive card guiding you into a successful interaction right out of the box so if I go ahead and click watching you this is going off to Q&A maker which you'll see in just a moment we're actually taking that knowledge that static arm so that someone in the business department or a non developer can curate the bot without getting in the way and having to involve developers with that content there so I can also go ahead and say you know what is your name for example again this is going off to chit chat so I can say what is your name what is your what is your age and it's going to go ahead and but and again going off to Q&A maker and kind of chit chat so I could also say you know what skills do you have again is gonna go off to Q&A maker knowledge is a really important part but in this case there's actually a follow-up question which Q&A maker can also follow up as well so if you are taking a user's question you want to narrow down the domain they're interested in again Q&A maker can help content owners manage this you can see it's going ahead and doing that so just to very quickly show you within the Q&A maker portal which many of you will be familiar with here is the copy you can go in here and make changes save and train and publish we've now got that role based access control so you can go ahead and see here this is how we're doing the follow up prompts again freeing up content for non-developers exciting new feature and if you using Q&A maker probably pretty excited about this I can go ahead let me just go and grab a image URL I can go ahead and actually with this rich text support within Q&A maker I can go ahead select an image paste in a link that and of course I probably pasted it wrong so let me try that one more time it's probably a bad character on it and the other look yes there is it go see the image and go ahead you can put in emoji in whatever you want so I'm going to go ahead now and save and train that new content I'm then gonna hit publish and we're gonna switch instantly back hey publish and I'm gonna go straight back to that same virtual system engine instance say what is the virtual assistant and with any luck well she will see that new content within there which is obviously sized to the size of the screen here so great bass assistant capabilities you're seeing a bit of sophistication there and bringing together a number of different capabilities now quickly within composer before I go on to something more complex you can see here at the top level there are some base level capabilities you're handling greetings so by going to here you can see I have activities I can add for sending messages and looping and here you can see I'm actually referencing a language generation entity if I hover over you can go ahead and see that information there the onboarding flow that you saw kicks off a child dial when we call FAQ it goes ahead and calls the FAQ dialog and if I show you the who skill and calendar skill you will see next we have triggering phrases here for onboarding for general FAQ calendar this is the Lu the Lois intense you can model within the same tool and not having to jump out to the newest portal which is a great step forward you can see we're invoking skills with that with a skit with a skill action and if we drill into how we handle chitchat you can plug in your own code for answering more general questions you can see we dropped on an action to call Q&A same for FAQ a really important part any of you have looked at a typical main dialogue in a box of quite a lot of logic for interruptions and top-level cancellations you can see all of this here right away language generation editing right within the tool here as well as canceling all the dialogs logging out unknown intent handlers going to chit chat and again you see a pretty simple onboarding flow and here is where you see that trigger that's sub dialogue within onboarding where if you say why it will trigger that and go back so really easy to understand what's going on so let's keep moving so within this same conversation language generation now has my name you'd now seeing that a parameterization here so I'm going to go ahead now and show off a new capability new preview capability of a new calendar skill built using composer and adaptive dialogues so I'm going to go ahead and say new meeting with Alex this is going to go ahead and identify this should be sent to the calendar skill and actually trigger this new calendar skill so it's going to go ahead and ask me what the title of the meeting so I'm gonna say it's a team meeting so the first few prompts are pretty straightforward using the power of Microsoft graph we're actually finding when these two people are available instead of asking you a time it's proposing when both of you available let's go ahead and choose the first one also sorting out time zone and do I know make it a team's meeting probably these days but not right now for this demo so I'm gonna say no to that now go ask me location and I'm gonna go actually where am i where am i later today where do I want this kind of meeting to be so in this case I'm gonna ask a question that's gonna trigger a context switch outside of this dialogue to do something else and then come back so again I'm not answering the question I'm saying what meetings do I have tomorrow so I am NOT providing the location but we're gonna detect that at that instant and we're gonna go in trigger get meetings another dialogue entirely and then come back and re prompt this context which a great an additional sophistication so I'm gonna go ahead and say City Center awesome it's now going to say what's description it's a tea meeting to discuss composure awesome so in we get and it's now asking me is it correct yes or no do I wanna go ahead and book this actually I forgot Allen so actually poor Allen list and he too had Allen to the meeting I'm not answering the question I've actually gone back and changing my mind and adding Allen to the meeting which you can see on the card that's like really crazy I just move this to tomorrow at 3 p.m. again I'm not answering the question I'm interrupting the flow it's clarifying I haven't been very clear and then it's moved it to tomorrow at the time and the last thing is either change the title to team sync again have completely changed my mind I'm not following the classic linear flow here and you can see all this interruption and changes have happened and if I click yes it will go ahead and kind of book that in my calendar and you'll see that this is all I've worked ill against a tenant switching gears very quickly the who skill powered by Microsoft graph allows us to before organization was searched so this is a capability we brought to life with a game composer and adaptive dialogues simpler than calendar and it provides a similar capability to what you see in teams today but you can now compose this within your assistant and customize it so I can go ahead and say I want to call who's this Allen person is talking and I haven't come across them before who are they in the organization so I can say who is Allen its achieving the photo I can say okay so who's the manager of Allen and it will go ahead and answer that I can go okay so yeah who purports into Patty for example somebody else again we're exploring the organization perhaps I'm wandering around the building when were allowed back and say what office there's Alex working again I forgot again we can go ahead and put answer the question and gonna pull that out and last but not least who emailed me about Bob framework there's some email last week someone emailed me about a topic powered by graph we are able to then go and identify the people you exchanged emails with so two really important kind of skill capabilities now quickly we don't have a time to go into great detail and I just clicked on the wrong one so wait for that to open and we're gonna go and open up the calendar skill I'm gonna show a little bit of how this works greeting when we start in authenticates and sends a response there's we've simplified this for this demo and there's a create event and again you get a list of meetings top level dialogues and you can see we collect some information and go in an authentication simple Roth login we then go and get the user's name from graphs we don't need to prompt which is a clever feature now in the create event dialogue I was a pretty sophisticated dialogue but look how simple it is I go ahead and get contacts I ask for the title of the meeting and here we have custom actions so this is where I have a custom library of actions I can drag on and I can go and party on in c-sharp and right the graph code that does the complexity of rest calls and massaging the data and I just find memory date/time timezone to these custom actions and if we scroll down this is as simple as that log is and the last step down here is create event we passed a token the title the description the meeting time start and end and here are the triggers this is how we were interrupting set attendees set date time location so we've got that triggering within the dialogue and also they're triggering outside of the dialogue for the context switching so really excited about this and very quickly inside of es code you'll see the custom actions that we built and these will be on the other on github here's the create event we've got a bunch of properties that we expose and bind to and then we have a method begin dialogue and this is where we party on with the graph API call the graph client and return data back really is that simple the custom actions we see as being kind of really powerful so let's now switch to the penultimate demo and we're doing pretty good on time so what I've got here is Orchestrator it's no dispatch is a capability we've had for quite some time which is really helped enable these param bot style scenarios we've got a pair of bot handing questions off to kind of downstream skills really important for system scenarios so to do that you need to have a question and figure out where to send it and to do that you need data from those skills training data to know the types of questions and how to hand that off and dispatch within our way of doing that until now so we've got something in private preview you know coming soon called Orchestrator now this leverages transformer models and is optimized for conversational AI it's a native implementation fantastic performance and we also have in this version that I have today a multi label classifier which means we can start to do multiple intense with any luck you'll see so this is a very late-breaking demo so let's let's go ahead and get started so in here I'm going to start with an empty model and just very quickly train it up so I'm going to go ahead and say hey and it doesn't understand what that is I'm gonna say that's a greeting so I'm gonna go ahead and say hello already match this to greeting with one label so okay great so I'm gonna I'm gonna reinforce that and put it into color greeting so I'm now going to say hey there good morning yo proper English top of the morning to you Irish actually all matched is greeting already a simple demo but you can get the idea so I'm now going to go ahead and say meeting this is calendar and I'm gonna go ahead to schedule time so these are just examples labels that I'm providing so I can now go ahead and say hey you know I want time with Darren tomorrow at 4 p.m. calendar very cool so I can now say hey I want to get time with Darren Calendar and a greeting putting out both of those interns really cool so let's just get a bit crazy so on a task so if I say add a task as an example and I'm gonna match this to to do and now going to say get some time with Laura and add a task to ring my parents to do and calendars pulled out both of those things we need to go to the to do skill we need to go to the calendar skill much more sophisticated toonces and one last thing I'm gonna say hurry maps to urgent fast as possible look where do you matched it to a legend but I'm gonna reinforce it let's see now if I say schedule time with Darren as soon as possible calendar and urgent really useful kind of Morty kind of intense there to go and help us do that so we're pretty much done and the last thing to show is back inside of composure if I have this skill and I can go ahead today and export this as a skill and you're seeing some of this I wanna reinforce that this is these are things you can do today but within power virtual agents I've got all this sophistication of adaptive dialogues and everything that's going on I can go ahead and add a skill give it the manifest link I've already got a few skill here and with empower virtual agents you can see I've got some trigger phrases and I've figured the action which just takes the question and passes it across and if I go ahead here and say who is Alan we're again going from power virtual agents into a composer based skill and showing that same thing working with empower virtual agents you get that better together capability so amazingly all those demos worked really well so and we're pretty good on time call to action before we go to Q&A we have a blog post that goes into all of this in more detail than I've been able to along with links to everything we've spoken about here go and get started with composer it's generally available as of this week they're fantastic tool it's in great excitement there we've got a very early preview of the VA that you saw and calendar to do and who were to help just show you some of the concepts and we'll continue to focus on that can I move them forward and there's a great new book covering some of the foundations and learnings that we've had other sessions there's a bunch of recordings hear more about composer more about language generated generation and Perkin of virtual agents and with that Q&A fantastic thanks Darren awesome demos really well done we've got some great questions through for Q&A the first one is is the meeting skill that's something available out of the box or des folks need to write their own so we have a meeting skill available today who uses waterfall dialogues in SDK v4 and that's something we have customers your live using today and actually includes the meeting room booking the sophistication that you've seen is something we've just got ready in time for build and we we are in the process of moving away from the waterfall dialogues into composer because we get a much more productivity much more sophisticated dialogues and it's gonna be a lot easier for customers to take and adjust and crucially reuse those actions if you want to just drag in a create meeting action you absolutely can so that composer evolution is very much kind of work in progress but there'll be early versions and everything's on github and we working cannibal out in the open fantastic and actually answers one of the other questions as to whether or not you could use the village of the system with composure that's great you've also mentioned the waterfall dialogues there and someone asked a great question which comes up quite a bit which is if I want to move over to use a doubt different composer do I need to throw away my waterfall dialogues and essentially no it's one or the other absolutely not and it's something we've thought very carefully about is around that composition we know customers have invested and it's been fantastic to see with SDK v4 and waterfall dialogues they carry on they still have a role to play there you've already got investments and actually we have samples they're allowed their show how you can drop composer dialogues into the same bot and actually have those kind of interrupts and even you know broken memory between those things another pattern is of course to go and build some skills using composer it can go all-in with new things and compose it together so we've got multiple composition stories but there's absolutely you do not need to start again brilliant and sort of related question all semi-related folk certainly seem to really like the LG and file format and they're wondering whether or not they can use LG without composer if they wanted to yeah no absolutely and in fact one of the things I didn't kind of get to I'll put it up here kind of quickly is while I talk or try and multitask is yes you can use LG within outside of composer the libraries are there you can add them into a bot and to be honest the virtual assistant 1.0 release to be released does not use composer because obviously is only just released but we are using wonderful dialogues and we're using LG through our we moved a little while ago and in fact you can kind of get a sense how much easier it is to see all the responses this is the view of the adaptive cards that this body is sending and kind of all the various kind of messages going back and the parameterization so yes you can absolutely make use of that today and I actually encourage you to to do that as well brilliant and I think we've got time for one last question before we wrap and this person was asking they saw the import of adapted dialogues into PVA in a session yesterday and they're wondering whether or not that's something that's available now or they need to wait for it yes you definitely do need to wait for that that was a pretty exciting demo a bunch of different engineers kind of work to get that ready so we could show a view into the future so it's not something you can do right now the power virtual agents team and the bot framework team are working together and hope to be able to announce that in the future but we're definitely harder work on it and you've seen some very early bits and actually the who's field you saw probably in that demo if it's the pre-recorded one we actually took exactly the same who skill bits we had we had to make a few changes just you to the engine right now and we just imported it so it really does work right and that's it thank you really thanks Darren thank you thank you everyone [Music]
