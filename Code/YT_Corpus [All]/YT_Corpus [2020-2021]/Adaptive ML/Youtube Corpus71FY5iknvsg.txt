 The ventilator simulator is an immersive online mechanical ventilation training tool. This release incorporates the most recent evidence-based guidelines in pediatric and adult ventilation, as well as COVID-19 information and COVID-19 patient cases. The virtual ventilator incorporates real-time changes in ventilatory parameters, patient appearance, vital signs, arterial blood gases, chest x-rays, and more. By completing this simulator, the learner will be able to: describe the key features of a mechanical ventilator. Set appropriate ventilation and oxygenation goals for a variety of patient conditions. Demonstrate how to titrate ventilator parameters to achieve adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Outline a systematic approach to the evaluation of a patient, non-invasive and invasive monitoring, and ventilator parameters to determine adequacy of ventilation and oxygenation. Demonstrate how to manage mechanically ventilated patients and troubleshoot problems that arise. Using the original version of the mechanical ventilator simulator, an international, multi-center prospective interventional study was conducted across 33 pediatric intensive care units in eight countries. The study demonstrated that residents learned as much about mechanical ventilation by using the simulator for five and a half hours than they did during an entire month in the intensive care unit. And the residents that used the simulator retained more knowledge two months later. Residents who completed the simulator before their picture rotation gained more knowledge overall than residents who completed the simulator after their PICU rotation. Rapid advancements in medicine and changing standards in medical education require new, efficient educational strategies. We hope the OPENPediatrics simulator can transform learning.
