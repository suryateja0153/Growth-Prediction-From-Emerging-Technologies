 [Music] the world is in the grip of the kovat 19 pandemic we desperately need public health measures that can reduce the risk of infection and deaths in addition to quarantine in this video we are going to talk about how vitamin D has become a useful measure to reduce the risk of kovat 19 by the way if you haven't subscribed us yet hit the subscribe button right now for more amazing videos like this and click the bell icon and make sure you want miss any updates a study done in Chicago has shown that more than half of kovat 19 cases and around 70% of kovat 19 deaths were observed in african-american individuals who are at the greater risk for vitamin D deficiency through several mechanisms vitamin D can reduce risk of infections basically we can categorize these mechanisms into three parts physical barrier cellular natural immunity and adaptive immunity those mechanisms include inducing catholicity --nz and defenses that can lower viral replication rates and reducing concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines that produce the inflammation that injures the lining of the lungs leading to pneumonia as well as increasing concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines now let's look at this bit closely during an eighth immunity the macrophages which engulf and destroy bacteria and viruses first connect with corona virus through its surface receptors at the same time the vitamin D receptors in the macrophages get activated now we know the most common circulating form of vitamin D which is 25 hydroxy vitamin D is converted to active form of vitamin D which is 125 dihydroxy vitamin D in the kidney but other than kidney macrophages to have this capability to form the active form of vitamin D now this 125 dihydroxy vitamin D makes catholicity n--'s and defensins through vitamin D receptors Tsarskoe v2 is an enveloped virus and it has surface receptors the defensins which made through the mediation of vitamin D pass through these receptors and make pores on the surface of the virus particle and destroy it on the other hand catholicity ins induce chemo taxis where it increases the macrophages function towards the virus particle catholicity ins increases the vascular permeability and increase the immune response and they have the ability to increase the amount of t-cells and b-cells in response to the viral attack all of these mechanisms trigger with adequate amounts of vitamin D in the body but sadly as kovat 19 pandemic vitamin d deficiency is also a global pandemic and vitamin D deficiency is most prevalent among elderly obese and smoking individuals who are the most vulnerable groups for kovat 19 infection therefore to reduce the risk of infection it is recommended that people at risk of getting kovat 19 consider taking 10,000 international units of vitamin D per day for a few weeks to rapidly raise 25 hydroxy vitamin D concentrations followed by five thousand international units per day so it's better to keep 100 to 150 nano mole per liter of vitamin D level in the body in order to prevent not only from kovat 19 but also from other infections diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases [Music]
