 hello I'm Spencer Johnson I'm a product manager with Google AdMob and AD miniature and I'm here to talk to you today about maximizing your revenue and retention with ad formats let's get started so one of our main goals here at AdMob an ad manager is to help you maximize your revenue from any demand source and we provide a variety of ad formats to help you do that you're probably familiar with all of these interstitials banners rewarded and native today I'd like to talk about the role that the format selection plays in helping you maximize your revenue so how do formats improve on revenue I'd like to think of it as helping you provide the right ad experience at the right time so let's talk about that a bit more and let's kind of start with a framework for how to think of this think of attention retention and revenue as a way to qualify for yourself whether an ad experience is the right one so for each ad experience ask yourself how is this users attention captured was this users attention captured in a way that's likely to help them come back and keep using my app or might they be driven a leg and most importantly is this sustainable for my business if I continue capturing users attention in this way and they are retained or not retained as the case may be will I have the revenue I need to grow my business create new content and move forward all of these questions should help you address whether an ad experience is the right one and the right ad experience is one that complements user journeys we'll talk about this more in just a second but as a quick example let's look at the ad on the right here a user is using a news app and they're reading through and they've hit a paywall the publisher can't afford to offer them more content for free so they'll need to subscribe or do something else in this case there's a rewarded app the user has the opportunity to engage with a 30-second reward of death in exchange for continuing to read the content this is a great example of complementing a user journey the user is already here they were already seeking to read and this actually allows them to keep reading so this is great but how might this work for other formats that aren't so transactional we'll get into that first let's talk a bit more about complementing user journeys and the role that formats play so format selection determines way Arnett can even be placed and when an ad can even be shown and what it looks like in short format selection governs how you just experience ads in your app so when it even user journey features things like audio and video complementing that journey with ads that are interactive or have audio and video it can be beneficial where is when a given journey has nothing but silence maybe that's right maybe that's not something to think about but in this news article case that we just talked about the reward of that complements the journey really well so now as promised let's talk about how that can be done with other formats I'd also like to use this opportunity as a sneak preview of some upcoming formats that were really excited about app open ads adaptive banner ads and rewarded interstitials let's talk about each one app open ads allow you to maximize user value from the moment the user opens your app so what are these many of you have apps with splash screens or time required to load the content this is a very normal and users are accustomed to it but this is time where a user isn't able to do anything there's no content for them to consume but they also can't switch activities or do something else in other words this could be the ideal time to present the user with an act so going back to the framework we talked about earlier how was the users attention captured well it's captured because they're opening the app and this is a natural thing that will come out for them as a splash screen and it's between when they choose to open the app and when the app is finally loaded so that's a tension but is this going to have good retention we believe it is and I'll tell you why well most of the screen is allocated for a beautiful advertiser creative that's hopefully well targeted to the user and an enjoyable experience for them we're also always reserving a large portion of the screen for the ability to continue through to the app that the user wanted to launch in the first place this will always be the same area and this consistency will help users develop a practice expectation for how to do what they want whether that's click on the ad or continue through to the app there won't be any confusion about how to make that choice and how to act on that choice so the user will have beautiful targeted ads and the ability to move past them that they want in a way the compliments and journey that already existed so the last piece is revenue well this is an AdMob and head manager a hundred percent incremental revenue because they were never asked here before and ads that are nearly full screen tend to monetize very well so we're confident that these will be a strong performer in your app moving on let's talk about adaptive banner ads adaptive banner is aimed to take one of the oldest ad formats banner ads and make them fit every device and every user journey better with no custom code on part of the developer so let's back up a bit to understand this really well banner ads are traditionally in fixed sizes you have to know what you want but as we know one size usually does not fit all so what can we do about it adaptive banners ask you for a bit more information not the size you want but the maximum width that you're comfortable filling on the device the width is all we need and with the width we can determine the ideal size banner ad for the device in question and pick the highest improving revenue and showing ads that look better for your users so how is the users attention captured well this is a good point to note that banner is typically capture attention in two ways you know they're fixed on the screen and your to the top or the bottom or they're gonna scroll view and the user Scrolls through them just as they scroll through content there's an adaptive manner for both use cases so how is the user retained how do adaptive manner has improve on retention well two ways for one they have a bigger and better better ad experience for the user let's look at the example on the right to think through this more visually on the top you'll see a standard 300 by 250 banner ad and you can see there's a lot of negative space in all sides on the bottom you can see an adaptive inline banner ad meant for use in scroll views this goes all the way to the edge of the edges of the screen and you'll note that the aspect ratio is actually bigger this is because we will never stretch or crop advertiser creatives to get the size we want the size will always be perfectly felt and the user experience will always be great one thing I'd like to highlight about adaptive banners previously if you wanted to show the right size I have four individual devices you would have had to write some custom code adaptive banners don't require any custom code and they perform consistently per device so for a given user on their device that user will always see the same slot size chosen by adaptive banners and their experience will always feel the same they don't get different sizes every time but a different user that might have a different device will get different sizes because the sizes that are the best for their device will be different for every user it will feel consistent and beautiful but it has the ability to be individual per user so let's talk about the revenue piece in our case studies we've seen revenue uplift in excess of 20 percent we're excited to publish these case studies soon and we hopefully have adapted manage to try and of course as one of our goals is to maximize the revenue from any demand source adaptive support mediation and open day moving on let's talk about rewarded interstitials so you might already be thinking well that's just two different ad formats rewarded ads and interstitial ads right well you're on the right track let's recap rewarded acts real quick rewarded ads allow you to show contextually relevant rewards to users and exchange her view of the act you can offer incentive at just the right time and contextually relevant rewards can lead users to prefer or death so we've seen this in many case studies already never worried ads perform really well so what have we changed for rewarded interstitials rewarded interstitials change the opt-in flow a normal rewarding that has a prompt where a user has to select an opting in to watch the rewarding experience an interstitial ad is not requiring an optimum and a rewarded interstitial carries for this philosophy there's still a chance to opt out but now it's a timer that counts down giving the user an opportunity to opt out but showing the rewarded bad if the user does not choose to opt out this is the difference between rewarded and rewarded interstitials why would word of interstitials they're just another tool in your toolkit to help you show contextually relevant rewards at the right time the news article example we highlighted earlier is a really good way to think about this the user in that case doesn't have to take any manual action or interact with any prompts they can just continue waiting watch the ad and continue with their news article in a less disruptive experience and as for the revenue piece we all know that we rewarded ads perform very strongly some of the strongest performance of all formats can be found with reporting now before we wrap up I'd like to talk about something that's not actually a format but is what I would like to think of as the evolution of the right ad experience at the right time smart segmentation smart segmentation is a product that allows you to predict users likely to purchase or not purchase subscribe or not subscribe depending on your app within the context of your app so how does it work smart segmentation runs a tensor flow based machine learning model to classify the users of your app you can use smart segmentation in your app and then ask for every user is this user likely to subscribe or purchase in my app so what does this have to do with the right ad experience at the right time well sometimes the right ad experience is no had experience at all for users that are strongly likely to purchase or subscribe you might not want to show ads and for other users who are almost never likely to purchase or subscribe ads might be the most practical monetization solution to sustain your business so smart segmentation aims to help you make that choice with data with smart segmentation for users who can't or won't spend you can still monetize fans let's talk about an example this is something we're calling smart segmentation for subscriptions here we see a case study of a publisher called geo Zillah based in Palo Alto their subscription-based app and they implemented smart segmentation to help classify whether their users were likely to subscribe they would ask smart segmentation for every user is this a predictive purchaser or non purchaser and based on that decision they would choose whether to render this report of that prompt users who are predicted to subscribe or be likely to subscribe we're not shown being prompt at all but users that were predicted not to be likely to subscribe receive is rewarded at dialogue so how did it work for them while our case studies show is 60% increase in day 1 retention and a 120 percent increase in new account creation this is the power of spread segmentation and I highly recommend you consider giving it a trial that's about all the time we have for today but as we wrap up I'd like to switch gears a bit and think of something other than ends I want to think about museums you may remember an art museum you've been to where canvases hung well that white walls summon decorative frames some in darker shadowy exhibits there might have even been some that had audio and video and sound and were really immersive so what does this have to do with what we're talking about imagine instead that the campuses themselves are advertiser creators but you the publisher get to build a museum you get to choose the frames you get to pick the lights configure the sound make every room what you want it to be so that you can be sure to compliment users on their journey through your app so next time you're implementing ad formats think about museums think about all the different possibilities of showing these creatives and think about how best you can come from with the users who are stepping through your app unconfident this will help you maximize your revenue from any demand source thank you hi and see a global product leave of admah Google's app monetization solution I would like to share a sneak peek of ad most recent development which will help you maximize your revenue you know as mob has been investing a lot to help you maximize your revenue and today I'm gonna show you some of the latest development and effort that we have which are still Nvidia starting with the app open bidding which is Google's in-app billing solution and following with AdMob mediation as a whole which is inclusive of open bidding but also traditional mediation all talk about how you can use it to maximize your revenue today and then we're gonna cover mediation AP test which is a new feature which will allow you to test different setups to find the best setup for your inventory and get the best ready okay let's go to begin first open bidding is a real-time option the Google provides we run a unit production with participating as sources and in third-party ads versus we have many of them already and that will allow them to compete on your single impression and to get the highest CPM for the impression so it will ensure maximize your revenue it will also help you simplify your ad operations with open bidding we provide a unified importing and billing which means that you will be able to see already new trajectories across Google and also third-party as forces participating open bidding in AdMob Savoy and you'll also get paid from Google so you don't have to worry about whether you can get beaten up for a certain app sources you have to check multiple places to ensure last but not least you will be able to use fewer SDK because many of the third-party app sources participating open bidding relies on Google mobile ads SDK to render their ads that means you don't have to implement their own SDK but you just need Google mobile ads SDK to receive kudos diamond and also factored for this team and so that's gonna make your implementation much easier and we've been running this build up for more than ten years and we've seen a healthy clause as you can see with simple impression and revenue to a healthy Jacob in 2019 alongside a new participation of new third-party L sources so bas really excited to see scope and will become food have a new moment in 2020 where everyone can use of bidding and you can make more money out of it well that's from our side of story so let me share what other same body stick ends here at Korea indie game developer they were looking for a solution to help them monetize and also like simplify the ant operation because they are indie game developer they only have six person in their studio and have many games to develop a signal so they were using mediation but they decided to try open bidding with us and they as a result they so 20% uplifting reckoning for me and they also saw a leaky unit to grow 22% and the most important part would the CEO or the meaning him is that the operation goals that they have for elevations decrease because of the simplicity of the bidding and that's a key part for them to use of reven will be maximally open bidding but what's also important is to protect your business and to be sustainable and to do so we know that these experiences here to that that's also why we are doing additional effort as a part of committing of expanding the ad identification to third party resources and occasion is our cool technology to let you find the ad creative that's served in your app within the googles a WI and then find the advertiser of it and take the react respect faction as you need to protect you use your user and protect the experience of your app and by spending this identification solution to third party participating or competing we will be able to let you find any ad creatives circle open bidding type in a WI and identify with which answers that came from and then you will be able to take an action respectively any participating third party asked versus and open bidding are eligible to join force with this identification as well now we are working hard to get more ass versus participating with this with that I would like to highlight how many people how many ass forces are currently working with us as a Google AdMob mediation without this much of the ass versus working directly with us and I love them we have about one third if not more all as forces work him with open bidding that's the top rectangular over there and the smaller rectangle would represent Astros is that participating open bidding with she googled mobile ads SDK support which means that you don't need to they're SDK but you will just get it when you check the box and I'm thin as you can see we have a lot of s which is participating open bidding and we are expecting a lot more to come in this year and we're excited to see the change but as you saw it you might start wondering that my network my ass was it is not invoking big rectangular box what should I do and we know that we understand the market is still not there where we can only have open B many of them sources may not be ready to move over to real-time mode or they may have other reasons to still be in waterful steam and many of them carries large chunk of your revenue so we want to support that part as well we want you to be able to maximize your revenue through the course of change that you will see in the industry that's why we built up and bidding works seamlessly with a waterfall a traditional waterfall and here's how it goes first you will you send a request to Google AdMob mediation and then we'll pick up to me a request and double me pick it out if you have a book on bidding set up will call all the open bidders and get their pins and we high speeding and I pass worse and that's a winner and then instead of just serving the winner we also acknowledge that there's a wonderful set up if you set it up the waterfall so we put the winner into the water hole note that the winners CPN is a real CPN meaning winners are ready to serve yes and that's exactly where as in the world most likely it is either predicted CPM or the manuals can be used in put in the water pool we try we still respect that because you'd have a good idea of what the CPM each and or as horses so with that we'll run the traditional waffle as we used to without competing winning light them in there and then we find the best eligible and creative and it'll be sure served to your app and that will maximize your revenue so let's go ahead and see one or two examples to help you understand the first scenario is that you have four US forces you have three ad networks in waterful cetera and what happens is in his case a lot of 4s versus net would be one with seven dollars and then what Elmo does is take that into the waterfall Oh viewers which has three networks so now that there will be full line items in the waterfall and it goes from the top which is hi-c CPM in this case never P and that the pizza open Billy never so they'll definitely do it so they all serve the ads next scenario where we have for game for X versus three networks but in this case open meeting Astros won with $4 that's exchange fee and again we bring that over to wonderful set of beers now you have four line items starting with network one with $5 so as normal traditional water runs we're going to start with number one and see if they feel if they feel they will feel the end they all serve the ads look that we don't know whether that's gonna be for $5 now so you need to make sure that your CPM the CPM is selling waterfall yes angry but if they don't feel that goes to next line item which is in this case exchange P and with $4 and in this time this is open bidding winner so it will be folded and they will feel so exchange Serbia's so that's how open bidding and waterfall works together seamlessly maximize your revenue and protect you from losing any potential revenue it may sound complicated so I'll give you like how to guide how to optimize your mediation to get the past definitely usable mediation for God's of million waterfall and bidding use as many as voices that you can handle or you are comfortable with because it will increase a competition and it will increase a CPM the other part is look out for those who you don't even need SDK because that means you can just check the box and get a relation with relationship with and you will be good to go and you will have potential higher CPM thanks to thank his competition that's total minimum and backup waterfall part we would like you to set up as you were setting up that means add any app sources that you want to use in the waterfall if you were multiple in third-party sources please do the same inaudible mediation as we fully support that use case as well we recommend you to add any assets that you are using open bidding to waterfall as well to prevent any potential risk of losing revenue as open believes in beta and we have many a sources in different stage to participate or testing out that beta system so we'd like you make sure that you do have a backup so in this case if you have one a source of most open bidding and waterfall that doesn't actually means that you will call them twice we will ensure that mediation will ensure that well when an ass horse is called in on bidding and the answers feed into meaning that answers Lana them in waterful will not participate in that wonderful for that impression so in other case where that asked us didn't make a bit into open bidding that's what we're gonna activate to as first line item within the waterfall so either an ass horse make a billion talk video and that will ensure that that answers will get a one chance to participate not both open bidding and waterfall so in that one will make that make sure everything is fair and square and get the best revenue and the buyers the answers will get the best access cheering bedroom so let's see what actual actual case looks like we know that you love hear from other developers well we now have played us here who is well known for to that games they migrated to Google mediation admonition us here and they so record high reckon it was 20% uplift in over and revenue and then we do feel even more stronger when it comes to non-us countries as you can see in the slide and they are very excited to see more more of the Republic or any other and fest from Google mediation including open building and traditional wonderful so you can take as a reference as well last panelist is the mediation Amy casting we know that you want to try out different setups such as new lab sources or music p.m. or change CPMs for a certain country and we also know that it takes time and effort for you to judge whether we trance better because it's so hard and our performance changed everyday so it's really not easy for you to make an objective call on which setup works better or not military testing will help you set up the a/b testing with your existing app and we even copy the existing setup to another variant so that you can change to the mediation and you will see the performs of two variants and then you will decide which one performs better and another strengths of the mediation and testing of ours is that we ensure you see the result that are scientific we ensure that you will will only show you the statistically significant result based on the clean data you may be able to choose a different segment like 10 to the 9 10 to 90 percent or 50 - 50 % segmentation but we'll ensure we get a minimum of impressions before we make a call on which one performs better or not so you don't make a mistake of making a judgment call to ollie based on incorrect data so that's how we want you to optimize your waterfall and maximize your revenue and of course we do have a excelent voice on this one as well game house tried out this VIP pass team as they were considering using open beta they heard about open bidding they want to see if it performs better but they also want to test it clearly so they used a mediation a defense team one side they have the traditional waterfall setup the other side they have open bidding on top of the traditional it's exactly the same as I suggested in the previous slide and they saw 12 person object in their ad revenue and then they saw the increase in their ear kiki aus Wow so Dallas result but that key part here is that they weren't able to see all these with just a click and in the add mobile UI and they can run the test again tomorrow just by clicking another experimental button and set up differently so that will he came up this feature will give you the Liberty to test multiple scenarios on your own and make a sound decision and maximize your revenue this is the what I can well share today and note that both open bidding and me genetic testing is a media stage so reach out to your Google representative if you want to participate in that and we expect him to make this available to all in this year so stay tuned thank you you
