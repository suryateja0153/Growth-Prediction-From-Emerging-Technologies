 hello and welcome to our frontiers and machine learning online event i'm sandy blythe and it's a pleasure for me to introduce you to this microsoft research event this is something new for msr at a unique time for all of us when so many of us cannot travel to have these discussions in person frontiers in machine learning continues a long-standing investment in engagement and collaboration with academia and the broader research community and replaces our north america faculty summit for 2020. that event has for over 20 years been an opportunity to gather together and renew old acquaintances meet new people and discuss research of common interest now while this event cannot fully replace the experience of an in-person summit we do hope to achieve many of the same objectives we have had input from many members of the community on the talks and the topics of our agenda and i hope you find the time worthwhile you can see that from the agenda we're aiming for a balance of presentations and panel discussions with opportunities to ask live questions of the participants as well as explore additional materials and do some virtual networking as frontiers continues our investment in research connections so too we continue with and expand our support for students and faculty in pursuit of state-of-the-art research across a wide variety of disciplines i'd like to take just a moment to overview some of those award programs from around the world that i hope you will find of interest our research fellows program in our bangalore india lab is a pre-doctoral program that provides one or two year roles in our msr india lab and offers access to state-of-the-art technology and the chance to work side by side with world class researchers from across a variety of disciplines our ada lovelace fellowship offers a full three-year tuition and stipend for phd students in their second year at a north american university who are from underrepresented groups in computer science it aims to address some of these structural obstacles to diverse students by providing an additional year of support beyond that of our north america phd fellowship the north american phd fellowship continues and remains a two-year program for third year students in north american universities and like the ada lovelace fellowship offers an opportunity to interview for an internship at msr and attend our phd summit which is a two-day workshop we held annually in one of our north america labs the msr asia fellowship offers a unique program including mentorship research networking and other academic opportunities and includes a cash award an optional internship in our beijing lab and attendance at select msr asia events the msr dissertation grant also recognizes the value of diversity in computing and supports phd candidates in their fourth year or later from groups again that are underrepresented in computing and we're pleased to have recently announced the newest group of 10 students who have been awarded the dissertation grants for 2020. this is our fourth year of offering the dissertation grant and this was by far the most competitive year yet our congratulations to this year's outstanding recipients our msr faculty fellowship is a two-year 100 000 per year award which recognizes promising new faculty at north american universities whose talent marks them as emerging leaders in their fields here as well we've recently announced our 2020 faculty fellows from nearly 200 nominations and who are distinguishing themselves across a diverse set of research interests congratulations to our 2020 fellowship winners now we've recently added two new awards in emea and latin america for students in their third year or beyond at a university in those regions here are the first set of award winners from both emea and latin america and they each receive a cash reward to help them complete their research and also to have travel and accommodations provided to attend our phd summit and we offer our congratulations on the award finally we continue our phd scholarship program in emea which provides an annual payment of up to three years for supervisors and students to do collaborative work on research themes aligned to our msr uk lab in cambridge england recipients may also receive an internship to one of our worldwide labs during the term of that scholarship these are just some of the faculty and student scholarship programs that are available and if you'd like more information i encourage you to check out the academic programs tab on our microsoft research website now frontiers is a virtual event as a result of the coven 19 pandemic msr is currently supporting a robust research agenda on the novel coronavirus as well as extending that research to prepare for future pandemics and we're pleased to have announced just last week awards of funding to nine different projects involving collaboration between microsoft and 19 different institutions to advance knowledge on infection prevention and control treatment and diagnosis the ethical allocation of resources mental health and return to work topics thank you for the collaboration and congratulations to these institutions where researchers continue to work with msr on pandemic preparedness also of note microsoft research and our microsoft ai for health team have partnered with cfar the canadian institute for advanced research on their ai and kovid 19 catalysts grants initiative we're proud to support the program in accelerating covid19 research by leveraging our azure high performance computing resource in addition to these programs the pandemic has brought into sharper relief the need to upgrade the resource available for research msr supports world-class research and echoes the call for a national ai research resource as recommended by a recent national security commission on ai eric horvitz the microsoft chief scientist was a commissioner on this report in addition to providing ai supercomputing cycles openly available data sets are necessary to advance the state of the art microsoft research's open data repository has made available curated data sets that microsoft researchers have used in conjunction with their own research the site is enabled to simplify access to data sets and enable the reproducibility of our research i'm pleased that we have today made the source for odr available on github by example the emergent alliance which is a not-for-profit community which aims to inform future economic decision-making and to aid in societal recovery post-covid 19 has recently used those sources from github and instantiated their own open data repository of relevant resources machine learning is a rapidly changing landscape and within the larger scope it's important for us to recognize the dramatic events and profound societal change underway as we all look to act and address systemic racial injustice around the world i won't recount the things that i'm proud of microsoft that is doing because there's so much yet to be done we must do better and we will do the work we'll sustain this three company-wide multi-year efforts we'll be increasing representation and our culture of inclusion by adding over 150 million dollars to our current diversity and inclusion investments and committing to and reporting against specific representation of blacks and african americans in leadership positions in the u.s we'll be engaging our ecosystem to use our balance sheet and engagement with our suppliers and partners to create new opportunities and we'll be strengthening our communities with the power of data technology research and partnership to improve the lives of blacks and african american citizens across our country and the safety and well-being in of our own employees in the communities in which they live the opportunity and the obligation for change is here you expected of us and we expect it from ourselves we're going to act with intention so clearly there's a lot going on around us and with msr and i encourage you to stay in connection with us through any of the web and social channels and to subscribe to our featured communication we are at our best when we're in close collaboration with this community and i hope you'll find that some of the very best of that is on display this week during frontiers of machine learning thanks and now i'm pleased to introduce a fireside chat between christopher bishop and peter lee christopher bishop is a technical fellow and the lab leader of our msuk lab in cambridge and peter lee is corporate vice president of research and incubation at microsoft thank you very much sandy for that nice introduction hello and a very warm welcome to the frontiers in machine learning event my name is chris bishop i'm a technical fellow at microsoft and i'm also the lab director of the microsoft research lab in cambridge uk today i'm delighted to be talking with peter lee who is a corporate vice president and who is in charge of research and incubation at microsoft worldwide peter it's a real pleasure to have you with us today uh thanks chris it's really really exciting to be here great and congratulations on your relatively new role now as head of research and incubation i guess you started what two or three months ago maybe we could just sort of dive right in and perhaps you could tell us a bit about well first of all why did microsoft choose to bring research and incubation uh together under the same roof as it were yeah you know i think in in a way uh the that question is really central and it's left as an exercise actually to all of us uh in microsoft research and in the incubations but i think there are a couple of uh factors that went into the thought process behind this one is that over the last few years certainly in the sacha nadella era for microsoft research and research-powered ideas and maybe most importantly researchers themselves have been getting increasingly involved in creating new technologies new engineering capabilities and actually new lines of business and new products for microsoft and i think that's been a direct response to the way the industry's been going so when you look at things like where silicon is going in the cloud or the whole idea of confidential computing or all of the kind of intensity of activity in the large-scale nlp pre-trained models all of those things and more are all fundamentally research powered and furthermore require the kind of mindset and world view from researchers and so the idea of linking together what we do in microsoft research and sort of making it more possible to capture emerging ideas and turn them into new possibilities for that's microsoft so-called incubation function there's a desire to somehow make that work even better than it has over the last few years and i think from the perspective especially for microsoft research it's pretty exciting because you know if you think about people like doug burger or galen hunt or lily chang or many many others you know who have sort of gotten involved now in creating very significant new possibilities or people like johannes gerke who started off as researchers and then you know had stints leading very significant engineering groups and now we're coming back to research that sort of can interplay between research and what the company is doing at a large scale is just getting incredibly important and so it has sort of just made logical sense to try to create a single organization that that just tries to maximize the benefit of that sort of thing there's one other element too just and i know i'm being slightly long-winded here but i think there's also been a desire in this setup to help organize and reunify all of microsoft research under one roof as you know it's been a little bit fragmented over the last few years and the hope is that we'll be able to build on the reputation and the impact and thought leadership of microsoft research as a whole by by bringing everything together thanks peter i mean i agree i think it is a very exciting development not only the reunification but as you say bringing us close to incubation many researchers love the fact that at microsoft we have the opportunity to reach hundreds of millions of people and just anything that reduces the friction of that has got to be a good thing um actually you when you took on the role of course you had a rather unusual start i think you were what a few days into the role and then our chief executive sachin adela asked you to sort of put things to one side and really focus on the company's response to covet 19 and think about how there might be opportunities for technology to really help the world respond to this pandemic so can you tell us a little bit about that experience and some of the projects that were spun up and and any sort of early results that we have yeah sure and uh first of all let me um just start by saying it it has been kind of a crazy time and i know um you know crazy is both the positive and negative just given uh the seriousness of this pandemic crisis um and also uh chris let me thank you for your patience because you know we made this change and then you and i uh you know were put back together um working very closely and then you know five days after that change happened i had to uh kind of put things on hold for a little while and um your patience with me i think is i really do appreciate a great deal um because you know what happened was we made this change and we created this new research and incubation organization i think that happened on a monday and then on that same week on thursday satya kevin scott and curtail benny asked me to put things on hold and focus on coordinating microsoft's response science and technology response to the covid19 crisis and there was frustration because you know it was hard to know how to get your ideas heard and seen and how to recruit and mobilize uh resources so one of the things that um just to try to get handle on this um was um we worked with the garage to stand up the hackbox platform that's used for our annual hackathons and we created a hackbox site so that people who just wanted to volunteer their time uh could could browse projects that were being posted um and join them if you had an idea for a project uh you could write them down uh their descriptions and and get them surfaced and and recruit people and then we had a v team set up involving mostly people from microsoft research to triage through all of those projects and try to surface ones that might benefit from more focused attention and that whole process i think was really good one thing that microsoft has really trained itself to do is is to do hackathons and so by the time we close that down there were 1100 microsoft employees uh who had joined projects and there were 186 projects that were set up um and each project had on average about five people uh or so out of that there were a couple dozen that kind of got plucked out and really got a lot of very focused attention and some of them have had tremendous impact one of course was in direct crisis response for hospitals and clinics that involve the health bot technology that's built on the bot framework and you know the problem there was you know people were flooding emergency departments in hot spot areas were calling call centers you know that were manned by nurses and it was just you know people were getting overwhelmed the health bot uh was set up in collaboration with the u.s uh cdc to have a self-assessment protocol and then a smart handoff to a telehealth session uh to to a call center or possibly to an emergency department or a drive up testing center and by now over 2100 hospitals and clinics around the world have installed this and the official self-assessment bot for the cdc uh is using this and so that's been tremendous and the hospitals that we talked to are reporting a 30 to 40 reduction in call center or telehealth volume as a result of that another project is has to do with diagnostics working with adaptive biotechnologies we've been involved in the deep analysis using machine learning of t-cell response to covid19 and that's resulting in a data set called immune code that's an open dataset for researchers and it is already looking like in the first tranche of data that's been published that there is a new type of diagnostic that's based on t cell response as opposed to antibody measurements or direct virus pcr analysis that would be much more precise much higher sensitivity and specificity as well as catch and diagnose disease early on and that's been sort of in the realm of a large number of other activities in support of new drug therapies in vaccines and then there's been just tremendous amount that just has to do with the public health just analyzing capacity and utilization for things like you know where are the next hot spot areas where are the vulnerable populations in various countries and and how well do those things match up with supply of intensive care units ventilators pbe equipment and so on um and so uh just a tremendous number of projects like this that i think we should all feel really proud of you know i think microsoft's response just just really has made a difference and continues to make a difference and out of that whole hackathon effort um over a third of the participants and over a third of the projects came out of microsoft research which i think is just just really amazing and it's really brought microsoft research front and center uh in in the company's response to covet 19. um clearly healthcare more generally is a major uh opportunity really for machine learning to have impact i know something that's very close to your heart and i wonder if we could just just step back a little bit um because of course before you took on your current role you spent several years building up the healthcare activities in microsoft and and can you share with us some of your thinking about microsoft's strategy in the healthcare space or even you know why microsoft why should microsoft be involved in healthcare at all yeah and uh chris you shouldn't give me too much credit for this because uh you know you yourself have been very much involved in this and um and the cambridge lab in particular and it has been something that has involved not just research but also the commercial business teams in azure and in the experiences and devices you know for me i think the way i thought about this was in three stages relevance value and transformation and and and they kind of came in stages you know when satya asked us to take on healthcare the first order of business was this issue of relevance and what i mean by relevance is um how would the stakeholders in the world of healthcare understand that microsoft had something to offer so how could we be relevant to the healthcare industry to healthcare providers hospitals clinics health systems to insurance providers and other pairs to the biopharma industry you know to medical technology companies startups and so on so there's a relevance there that we had to somehow figure out uh how to earn because by doing that then we could get into collaborations and partnerships and start to learn more but then there's also relevance within microsoft because healthcare is one of these areas where you know everyone has direct experience with healthcare everyone has an opinion that experience tends to be colored by people's personal contact with doctors and nurses and hospitals but is largely ignorant of the much much bigger world of healthcare that happens behind the scenes and so we had to work to earn credibility and relevance internally um and so to do that you know that really meant trying to find the right partners across microsoft and early on i made a decision to partner closely with the commercial business led by judson aldhoff and by jean-philippe courtois to really identify key early partners that we could work with you know like the nhs like humana like walgreens and so on and by doing that we earned both internal external relevance then the second stage was value and that was largely about data and ai there's a tremendous amount happening with healthcare data today around this problem what's called interoperability you know really trying to get health data flowing uh in a standardized format to where it needs to be and making it more susceptible to machine learning and data analysis so we've done a huge amount of work to sort of evolve azure dynamics and microsoft 365 so that they speak the language of health data so you hear things like fire and smart and so these are sort of new emerging standards for health data and then the ai is tremendously fundamental and and important um you know a huge amount of that health data is unstructured text so nlp and machine reading become incredibly important computer vision to really understand medical imaging understanding molecules understanding the human genome all of these things understanding the immune system and the immune all of these things end up being fundamentally machine learning and ai problems and so so that's another area that we've really been focused on and you know trying to build up that technology stack for each of these things and then get things out in as products has been uh the the big challenge and um you know and and your question chris why are we doing this my favorite example of this is um to try to get people within microsoft to understand the global market for healthcare is estimated to be about 7.5 trillion dollars now you know what what does that mean let's just take one company that we work pretty closely with in the u.s it's a company called optum and what optum does is they handle the data for medical claims to route them from healthcare providers to payers and then the remittances from payers back to providers and so that data stream that goes back and forth is a very important function in the health care system in the united states and there's a lot of data analytics that helps facilitate that in both directions and optum is the second largest provider of that service in the u.s healthcare system so that niche market in optum sustains a company optim that has the same head count and the same annual revenues as microsoft all up and so if you think about the possibilities in this massive shift that's happening right now of healthcare to the cloud there is no reason why healthcare in our cloud shouldn't be bigger than all of microsoft's current business combined and of course one of the most interesting points of our collaboration together has been about with novartis and so um it's just something that we've all been so excited about so it'd be great to hear from you uh a little bit more about that yeah so this is a really exciting opportunity it's also a very different um sort of mode of operation i suppose for microsoft research i've been privileged to be part of msr for over 23 years now and historically we would do a lot of basic research from time to time we would transfer technology into products the products would ship customers would get to use them and so we'd have real world impact but it was this very this long chain of process uh by which we connected with the real world as it were and now in this partnership with novartis working directly with a customer and it's uh it's very exciting i think very very relevant in the world of machine learning in this new data-driven world because we're no longer thinking about one-size-fits-all technology that sort of put on a disk and shrink wrapped and and sent around the world things are much more bespoke now bespoke to a particular domain and even to a particular collaborator and a particular application and so we're working very closely with novartis under this new five-year partnership it was signed last year it kicked off in january of this year there are different components to it but the piece that i'm looking after is the research component the the longer term uh component of this uh collaboration and it's really a a peer-to-peer partnership between scientists in microsoft research and scientists in novartis bringing together their amazing expertise in in pharma and their amazing data that they've been building up along with our expertise in machine learning and of course leveraging microsoft's cloud with the the storage and the very powerful compute that we have and seeing how together we can go after some really tough challenges that it just wouldn't be possible for either organization to do on their own so we've we've started a number of projects we're probably not yet talking publicly in detail about those projects but i can share a sense of the the kinds of things that we're working on together one of the things we've done is to think about leveraging the sort of expertise and technology that we already have in microsoft research and seeing how that's applicable to some of the challenges in novartis for example we have a project called inner eye that was started a few years ago and this really looks at medical imaging and in particular the segmentation of three-dimensional medical images such as cat and mri and there are various applications for this but one important one is so-called radiation therapy planning so if somebody has a solid tumor that's going to be treated with radiation then there's some software that has to optimize the three-dimensional shape of the beams to sort of maximize the damage to the tumor and minimize damage to surrounding tissue and especially to vital organs and so in order for that software to work it needs a three-dimensional map of that tumor and that's where inner eye comes in so at the moment radiation oncologists will will take the 3d scan and then literally go through this slice by slice with a stylus on the on the computer screen marking out the boundary and that can take you know 20 minutes for a simple case or if it's metastasized there are multiple tumors it can take several hours it's painstaking it's tedious you kind of have to be accurate and this is where nri can really help the workflow for the radiation oncologists by automatically and in the space of a few seconds producing a sort of candidate segmentation and the the human expert can then go over and fix up any any little details that they want to change but it really speeds up that that process that that technology is actually being used in in a research environment it quite extensively in a local hospital in cambridge called adam brooks a very one of europe's largest teaching and research hospitals and we're we're delighted to see that technology being being explored in that way in in clinical practice effectively you know chris the thing that i think that particular example highlights is again how important microsoft research is because it's it's not that it wasn't possible for the inter-i application to just take an existing off-the-shelf machine learning or computer vision system or even an off-the-shelf machine learning algorithm or computer vision algorithm something new had to be developed specifically for that application to work well and you know it really takes a world-class research organization to be able to do anything like that and and so it's it really highlights just how important the partnership with an organization like microsoft research is yeah i think that's right i think it's that that intersection of both deep research and real-world application that gets a lot of researchers excited i mean for me it's the thing that gets me out of bed in the morning the fact that we we we have an opportunity to have impact on the real world in the case of healthcare improve lives save lives and and yet that's enabled by first of all tackling some very hard research problems so it's that it's that combination of deep research and real world impact that for me at least is tremendously exciting yeah for sure another nice example of something we're doing with novartis really goes to the heart of their business which of course is creating new drugs new therapies which which effectively means discovering new molecules what's interesting here is that the nature of the data is rather different from many other applications if you think about let's say imaging again images tend to come in a fixed size or you can re-sample to a fixed size so the neural network always gets data in the same format the same dimension as it were but molecules are interesting because they're obviously they vary in size and shape and configuration and so you can't take a simple representation of a molecule and treat that as the input to a neural network because it's it has this variable variable configuration there's some techniques called graph neural networks that were really pioneered in in microsoft research which addressed that problem of how to take machine learning and apply it to data which it has variable size and structures things like molecules and so again that's a really nice example of taking some of the deep research from microsoft research and combining that with the expertise that novartis has in understanding the relationships between the structures of molecules and their biological activity and that's a project which it would be difficult to imagine either either group on their own doing such a good job but together we can do things that i think are really unique and very very interesting yeah and again you know i think one of the interesting scientific challenges is the uh you can't hope to solve this uh problem purely based on the data nor purely on the basis of our understanding of the chemical uh processes you really need a combination of the two sure and i and i i think one of the really interesting things about healthcare of course is the opportunity for for real world impact and and and benefiting society i think also healthcare really throws a spotlight on many many deep challenges research challenges in machine learning and in fact i know we're going to be looking at many of those during this frontiers and machine learning event and this may be a good moment then just to play a little taster video so this is a little clip by best miranushi who's a senior researcher at microsoft and she's going to be leading a session in this event on machine learning reliability and robustness so let's just have a little look at that clip hi everyone my name is bismillah and i am a researcher in the adaptive systems and interaction group at microsoft research this year at the frontiers in machine learning event we are organizing a session on machine learning reliability and robustness to discuss recent work on reliability guarantees of machine learning algorithms but also on how such guarantees translate to the real world this session will review properties of machine learning algorithms that make them more preferable than others from a reliability lens such as consistency interpretability or generalization to new instances and second we will also review tooling support that is needed for machine learning developers to verify and build with these properties in mind we will have three well-known researchers in the field to share their work and thoughts tom dietrich is a distinguished professor in oregon state university and he will talk about novel category detection in machine learning and vision educamar is a senior principal researcher in msr and she will share her work on blind spot detection in the open world and finally such issaria who is a professor at john hopkins university will talk about the work that is done in her lab for safe deployment of machine learning under various data shifts with applications in healthcare in the last 30 minutes we will also have an open discussion among the speakers and the audience thanks so much for attending and very much looking forward to meeting you virtually at the session okay so that's a pretty impressive lineup of participants that bismir has assembled for that and i'm really looking forward to that session so um peter we've talked a lot about covet 19 and of course another big impact from this global pandemic has been this amazing shift towards remote working and working from home and an associated sort of explosion in the use of remote collaboration technologies things such as microsoft teams now johannes gurka is a technical fellow at microsoft and he recently transitioned into our org to become the managing director of our complete portfolio of research activities in redmond johannes prior to that was responsible for things like large-scale engineering activities in microsoft office and specifically in the area of the scalability of ai and microsoft teams before joining microsoft he was a professor at cornell university where his scholarly work and many accolades including election as an acm fellow and an ieee fellow and he also won the 2011 ieee computer society technical achievement award so i think johannes is probably the ideal person to share with us his thoughts on the changes that we're seeing in productivity and the technology that supports that and more specifically how machine learning can further empower us in in that world so a few days ago i spoke with johannes about his new role and i asked him about the impact of remote working and also the power of machine learning to improve this technology so let's have a little look at that interview we're delighted that you've joined microsoft research i know you've only been enrolled a very short time but can you tell us a little bit about the new role and what it will involve yes i'm in the role now for about four weeks and it's really a privilege to be here i mean there's so many amazing people there's really a huge breadth of research going on and you'll see this um you know throughout this conference as well um so i think what it can bring to the role is that i have seen the different parts of research both at a university and now i'm experiencing it here at microsoft research but i also bring with a good understanding of what it means to be both in a startup as well as in a product team so especially here in the last seven years while i was at microsoft i've gained a deep understanding and a lot of empathy of what it means to ship products and how to scale software development to hundreds of engineers how to think when you're in a product group when you have to develop new features when you have to talk to customers and what are the challenges in working with all the existing systems because every new system that you build here at microsoft often has some legacy components to it i need to bring these legacy components into the new world so i hope to leverage this breadth of knowledge both from the research side as well as from the microsoft internal side here in manual so our focus here of course is on machine learning so what are your thoughts on the role that machine learning could play in terms of productivity tools and technology yeah so there are quite a few um interesting ideas i think the first one of course is to look at the audio and video stack and and look at where there's often a lot of old control theory whether we can replace that with machine learning um you know we're recently and we're about to ship noise suppression where we basically take an um an old-style gaussian noise suppressor and replace it with machine learning and the advances there are really amazing and this this is also a good example where machine learning research is playing a big role but also the gap between the papers that were published and actually what can be shipped um was really big and so we had to do a lot more work to make the mods more performant and also work for the large variety of noises that we actually see in practice so so basically the whole control plane maybe even the data plane of the audio media stack can be replaced with machine learning in my opinion um second of all there might be very interesting user-facing features you know if you think right now we have a feature where i can raise my hand but then people forget to take their hands down or when they're done speaking so i think there's a lot of user facing features where we can just ease the level of interaction through the subtle signals that we usually see when we talk with each other one-on-one or you know in a physical setting that we don't really have in a virtual setting yet here at all yeah i think it's really interesting isn't it to see just how ubiquitous machine learning is becoming and as you say how many of these sort of more traditional problems are now being replaced with machine learning solutions that many times work better because they're tuned to the particular data or the particular environment in which they're actually used instead of being sort of general purpose i think that's i think that is one of the the big frontiers of machine learning these days thank you very much johannes and if you'd like to hear more from johannes then the full 15-minute interview will be available in the highlight section of the website so uh peter i think it's pretty exciting that we've managed to persuade johannes to come and join us in microsoft research don't you think yeah well let's face it uh johannes is genetically a researcher and so he belongs in our org and so it's i think it's great and i know uh we're all very excited i've actually tracked johannes's career ever since he started his professorship you know he finished his phd at the university of wisconsin actually his phd advisor is raghu ramakrishnan who's now in azure of course also a technical fellow and you know johannes did some wonderful work as a professor at cornell and then joined microsoft now i think the intent when he joined microsoft was always to be a part of microsoft research but he quickly got sucked into some significant engineering leadership opportunities in various product groups and and so it's just thrilling to have him be here and you know as always almost everything is infused with machine learning and so maybe chris this brings us back to you because you've been of course one of the pioneers and one of the worldwide leaders in machine learning for the past 30 years or more it would be interesting to get your thoughts on you know how has the field changed and evolved over the 30 years that you've been in it i think for me though the biggest shift um over those 30 years has been really in the in terms of the emphasis of the field because for most of those 30 years certainly for the first 20 of those 30 years if i'm honest machine learning didn't really work that well there was a lot of excitement everybody understood the potential intellectually it was fascinating but the reality was that the performance of of many machine learning systems was really not adequate for real world use there were maybe a few niche applications but mostly it didn't really live up to the to the promise or the excitement and of course that's really changed in the last decade and especially through the development of deep neural networks and deep learning and and scaling up to large data sets and large amounts of compute and so today we're in a world where there are literally thousands of applications of machine learning i mean most people have used several already today probably even without knowing it um it's becoming ubiquitous and that means that although we continue to have a strong focus on the on the performance in the sense of the accuracy of machine learning we always want to make it more accurate because we're now using machine learning in real world applications it opens up a whole raft of of new challenges i think of as a sort of a penumbra of research questions that surround the core question of just getting the machine learning to work at all i think things like biases that creep into the predictions because of biases in the data set for example thinking about fairness thinking about explainability thinking about causality if we actually want to make interventions on the basis of predictions um adversarial issues you know nobody was going to attack my my neurops paper 20 years ago but once you put something online and you've got 100 million people using it there are then adversarial uh agents out there people with ill intent will attack it in all sorts of ways for a variety of different reasons and we have to we have to worry about those issues as well and actually this is probably a good point to show another of the taster videos um because i think this is uh very relevant to this discussion this is one by rich caruana he's a senior principal researcher at microsoft research and he's in this video he's talking about an upcoming session that he's organizing at this event called interpretable machine learning so let's hear from rich hi i'm rich carwana a machine learning researcher at microsoft research in redmond this session is about saving lives by using interpretable machine learning in healthcare because healthcare data is very complex it's critical to use interpretable machine learning methods to make sure that the models we train are safe to deploy and use on real patients one challenge is that most patients are already receiving treatment and that can cause confounding in the data for example a model might learn that high blood pressure looks like it's good for you because the treatment given to you when your blood pressure is high lowers your risk compared to healthier patients who had lower blood pressure to begin with there are many ways this kind of confounding can cause models to learn to predict very risky things in the first presentation i'll talk about problems like this that we see in healthcare data thanks to the interpretable machine learning methods we're using in the second presentation ankara turo desai from the university of washington is going to talk about fairness in machine learning when it's used for healthcare and in the last presentation marzia gassami from the university of toronto will talk about how interpretable explainable and transparent ai can actually be dangerous when used in healthcare looks like an exciting lineup so please join us wow chris you know that's just awesome and you know what a what's an exciting session and um some amazing speakers um you know the the whole event is about an effect called frontiers of machine learning and so it'd be interesting i think for people to hear what are your you know what are chris bishop's views about the important frontiers and where is the field heading over the next few years okay thanks pete that's a great question um well of course in one sense my answer is that this whole event as you say is about those frontiers and really it's not for me to provide the answers i i really encourage people um to you know dive deep into this event engage with all of the different activities we've got an incredible lineup of amazing people external people and great people from from within microsoft and between them i don't think we'll arrive at all the answers but we'll certainly touch on many of the key issues and hear some some very interesting uh viewpoints on these on these many frontiers um i certainly don't have all the answers but i'll just offer a couple of thoughts maybe um on things which i think are are trends that we're seeing right now that i think are very exciting one of them is i suppose in a sense fairly obvious and it's it's the scaling one of the reasons why machine learning works so much better today is because we've learned to scale to scale the size of the data sets to learn that to scale the size of the learning algorithms the models in terms of the number of parameters and of course we've had to scale up the compute in order to be able to train large models on large data sets and and that trend looks set to continue when we think about the developments in in natural language models for example there's no sense that we've reached some sort of asymptote there's every indication that as we bring larger data sets bigger models more compute to bear we'll see more and more improvements in performance more and more of these emerging properties has really been quite remarkable so real challenge for the field is how we stay on that curve how we continue to see these massive increases in in in the performance of machine learning hardware and of course that's something which of great interest to microsoft and we're doing a lot of work in that space at the moment so i think that's one very important trend i think that's set to continue the other one really relates to the fact that machine learning is really about data data sits at the heart of of machine learning and as we seek to bring the power of machine learning to more and more domains we talked a lot about healthcare is a great example of many other domains where the data that's being collected the data is available the data we could potentially gather in the future clearly has a lot of potential to bring great benefit to society but much of that data is also very sensitive it may be very personal in the case of healthcare data is a great example but data generally we need to be very careful about data both from a privacy point of view and from a security point of view and this is a i think a very exciting and very important frontier it's one where microsoft in in many ways has has taken a lead in terms of the the ability to provide confidentiality for machine learning within the cloud we're the first cloud provider to deploy technology that allows data to remain encrypted not only when it's being transmitted over the internet and stored but right up to the point where it's actually inside the processor so the decryption only happens inside the processor and it means even somebody in the data center with physical access to the chip would only see encrypted data going on and off the chip they still wouldn't have access to the data so very high levels of security and privacy and that allows some really interesting scenarios so we know that machine learning not only benefits from more data but it benefits from diverse data sometimes you can bring several data sets together and you can get more than the sum of the parts and the question is how can let's say different organizations different people how can they bring their data together and pool that data for machine learning without simply having to give other people or other organizations at direct access to the data well this confidential machine learning opens up that possibility the idea that data can be brought together it's only decrypted on the chip it's used within the chip to train a machine learning model and that machine learning model is then made available or its predictions are made available to the providers of the data it was trained on the pool data so it's more effective more capable and yet at no stage did any of those entities have access to the data from the other entities in fact at no stage did microsoft have access to any of the data so i think that uh intersection of privacy with machine learning is going to be a very important area in the years to come but those are just examples of frontiers in machine learning and we'll see many more important frontiers over the next few days which actually i think is a good moment to play our final taster video this one comes from staff ross volos he's a senior researcher in microsoft research and he's going to be leading a session on accelerating machine learning with confidential computing so here's stavros so hi everyone i'm starbuzz boss a researcher in the microsoft research cambridge and i'm sharing the session on accelerating machine learning with conventional computing so in this session we have an exciting agenda with topics across the whole confessional computing stack okay so let's let's talk more about confidential machine learning so today's clouds are spending an increasing amount of compute cycles on machine learning tasks one key concern of these systems is the privacy of the data being analyzed as well as the results of such analysis so the these concerns have raised the need for confessional ml uh platforms now the goal of this system is to provide strong security and privacy concerns to cloud tenants a key block in these systems is conventional computing hardware which is trusted by cloud tenants in turn the hardware provides the assurance to remote entities that their data code and models can remain protected from privileged attackers and cloud administrators throughout the computation of the job now in this session our speakers will present applications and advances in conventional ai platforms first we'll find out how entities can securely collaborate and train accurate models using sensitive data while relying on conventional computing hardware then we'll learn how cloud accelerator systems can be designed to provide strong security guarantees overcoming their performance limitations of cpu-based confessional computing so i hope you enjoyed this session and would like to hear your questions at the end of this talk thanks well you know again it just seems so interesting and you know as you were saying earlier chris before playing that video there's so much happening just in terms of scale and in fact i think even specialists have a hard time appreciating uh just this the scale that we're operating at right now it's just stunning and you know by the way this also brings us back to the beginning of our conversation about why bring research and incubations together yet i think it does seem extremely natural in this new world to bring bring research and incubation so close together as you say i think it's a very natural thing to to do and very exciting and because of this ubiquity of machine learning it means that machine learning is is not only showing up in lots of different places but it's really impacting society in in very new ways that we haven't seen before in fact microsoft researcher mary gray she's a senior principal researcher in microsoft research and she's going to be leading a panel discussion tomorrow in fact which will be talking about how we can push on the machine learning frontiers in ways that deliver better social equity which is a a topic of the course is very much on our minds these days so i'm very excited about that uh so peter it looks like we've pretty much used up our time um i think for the last 10 minutes or so we'd like to just open this up to questions now my colleague rachel howard has been monitoring the feed so rachel do we have any questions thanks chris thanks peter so chris i think i'll come to you first as we've had a few questions related to data privacy and perhaps i'll read out a couple and you can cover them both at the same time so we have since healthcare data is sensitive and private there is a trade-off between maintaining privacy while explaining any high-level insight on how to approach this and the other is is there any research on secure multi-party computation to maintain data privacy thanks that's a great question i think it's actually true in general there is this tension between the desire to create value out of data and the need to protect data and preserve privacy and there isn't a sort of one-size-fits-all answer to this but some research that we're doing in microsoft research um really aims to get to the heart of this and address that trade-off and you heard heard me talk a little bit about it already there the idea that of course it's very easy to protect data when it's at rest or when it's being transferred from one place to another because it's encrypted but to get value out of the data you need to decrypt it so the idea of this uh secure computation is to decrypt the data only on chip and the the goal really is to be at the stage where um even if somebody were in the data center and even if they had access to all the passwords and even if they had clips and could could measure the signals going in and out of the pins on the chip they still wouldn't be able to see the data they would just see what appeared to be random noise just encrypted data so that's the goal and that's very powerful in general is particularly powerful in machine learning when you want to do this aggregation of data from different sources different people different providers and uh and train up models on aggregated data because those models are often better than data than models just trained on single sources of data but there are still open research questions so we've made a lot of advance the technology that we developed in microsoft research is now deployed in azure uh microsoft was the world's first company to have this technology deployed live in its cloud but there are still open questions there are interesting questions about leakage of information via train models so there's a lot of research still to be told to be done in this space peter i don't know if you want to add anything yeah i think you know all of the leadership and leading research now that is deployed and is a standard part of microsoft azure i think has been tremendous but as you were saying there's still a lot more that has to be done um and you know there's also a range of things you know if you have healthcare data that's in the fire standard fire format we have anonymization apis that meet the legal standards for anonymizing but it's not really the same as really kind of locking down and then protecting uh people's identities and so uh the need for more uh research both in silicon architectures in uh core cryptographic algorithms and protocols all the way to ai i think is still a major focus especially for for you and your lab chris yeah absolutely i i saw there's also a question about homomorphic encryption which is also very interesting it's a sort of a i view it as a complimentary technique it's uh it's one that produces very very high levels of security and privacy um but it perhaps lacks the generality in the scaling that confidential computing offers so i think right now confidential computing looks like a very practical technology that we're already using in real scenarios but a lot more work to be done in this space well there's another aspect that i think about with research because even if we don't necessarily feel we can have a general homomorphic encryption uh deployed let's say in product form today it dramatically influences our thinking it makes us think a little bit differently about the whole problem and how we might approach it and so um it gives us sort of more room to be creative than uh with you know how would we go about this yeah i also think actually it's very beautiful it's surprising that you can do it at least to me the fact that you can do tomorrow encryption and data without decrypting it it's sort of magical so it's kind of inspiring as well yep thanks rachel do we have anything else we do so peter can you perhaps um share a little bit more about microsoft's approach to fairness in ai well um there again there's a range of uh aspects um and in the chat you know i posted a paper that's on my reading list about biases analysis biases and nlp trained models um but stepping back for a moment you know of course uh the technologist in all of us is looking for tools uh and in tools uh things uh frameworks like shap and lime where we have very intensive research and development going on give us an ability to create models that then can be analyzed for different kinds of biases so if you wanted to ask a question is this model let's say biased um with respect to age uh you know ageism or race or gender these shep and lyme and similar kinds of frameworks give you an ability to ask those questions models do an analysis and and get some insights into whether that's true or not and that has actually already started to have an impact for example as microsoft works for example with the financial services industry you know where ageism for example in the denial of of a credit application is is actually illegal and that has then created a great deal of interest across microsoft research and whether applications of frameworks like that and tools like this could be useful say in healthcare settings and and so that's one aspect but then popping up a level there's just also generally the policy how should we behave and think and conduct our research and deploy technology in a responsible way in a way that really gives us a chance that these technologies as they develop are used in the most ethical way with the most positive societal implications and so we try to work in that span of just actual concrete tools that researchers and developers can use all the way to thinking uh about the influence of these technologies uh on our policy thinking um chris uh i i know you've also been really pushing a lot of this uh as well in your own direct research yeah absolutely and it's interesting i mean healthcare is one of the fastest growing areas in in the cambridge lab for example but in the redmond lab and others as well and it's a it's a great domain that highlights i think really brings all of these issues into it's a very sharp focus and not least because you know the potential upside when we can address them is so enormous the opportunity to improve lives and improve healthcare outcomes and so on so although a lot of these issues are very broad and very generic i personally feel particularly passionate about the healthcare space is a great domain to to stimulate research simply because it's so motivating at least that's that's something i find personally so uh i know this time is getting on a little bit i know we haven't addressed all of the questions but um you know perhaps in the interest of time and with the next session we should uh perhaps draw this to a close um first of all we say a big thank you to peter it's been enormous fun chatting with you uh we could uh obviously chat all day it's been quite a lot of fun a big thank you to to the team for pulling us together and for rachel for triaging and asking the questions so uh we'll move shortly to the the next session um this is going to be led by susan demay she's a world leading researcher and also a technical fellow at microsoft and she's going to be leading a panel uh called machine learning conversations so i do hope you can join us for that and meanwhile just a big thank you again to peter and i hope you'll all have a very stimulating and informative event over the next few days thank you very much thanks chris thanks to everyone for being here
