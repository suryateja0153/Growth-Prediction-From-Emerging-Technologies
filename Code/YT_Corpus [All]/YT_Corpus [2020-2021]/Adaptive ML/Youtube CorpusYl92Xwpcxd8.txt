 hey guys welcome to another stream which I just recorded still quite haven't got the streaming stuff working yet but today I wanted to cover adaptive sampling in blender and how you can use our add-on with that hopefully fingers crossed to get your render times down even further so if you don't know blender 2.9 which I'm going to switch to nil has got adaptive sampling for cycles so if you're not unfamiliar well that means it just means that more samples are used where necessary the less samples I used where they're not as necessary if that makes sense because normally when you use blender you set how many samples you want so I've got the mic pan benchmark seen up here and you're probably used to setting how many samples you want and that controls how nice your final render looks so if you've got lots of noise you turn this up and it makes it look nicer but obviously the render times come down and you can you can't really control where those samples are use so for example if you've just got a plain color like this background here as long as your scene is relatively well set up so you don't have any tiny point lights in it or any sort of parts of the scene where rays from here might bounce into a very small space and then hit a light but that's a very low chance which will give you fireflies these tend to not nee as many samples but obviously when you set 400 like I have it's gonna do 400 samples for every pixel in the image which you don't really need you just need it the noisy areas adaptive sampling takes care of that by using some clever trickery which I won't go into code know much about it to only use the samples where they're actually needed where there are noisy parts to the image so this is a very very cool feature and obviously you know I'm nuts about trying to get render times down which is why you know I made and Chris and Jeremy and Martin make the crab an add-on which allows you to use more than one computer to render the same scene but this is just such a cool feature because it automatically gives you great savings even without having to use any multiple computing render farm software packages so I thought it would be cool if we try out and benchmark just the mic pen scene with one computer I've already done one run so I'm gonna stick adaptive samples on render that and then I'm gonna connect another computer up and we're going to see how much we can save in total if we use adaptive sampling plus two computers versus just one computer by its own so hopefully this is going to help everyone get their render times down now this is not going to be a tutorial about how the details of how adaptive sampling works I just thought I'd show this off and get you guys a bit of a taste of what you can do if you really go all out use adaptive sampling and more than one computer so let's see what can do it this could be fun or it could be terrible I don't know I have actually not rehearsed this I'm not gonna edit it you're just gonna watch me try and try and demonstrate using adaptive sampling with multiple computers and if it works it works it's gonna be an interesting video alright so this is the first run I've done so it's three minutes 46 and this didn't have adaptive sampling on so just to give you an idea of what software we're using so if I bring up the splash screen you can see that we using 2.9 alpha you can see the build hash I downloaded that today suppose today the 8th of May there you go 8th of May so you want to follow along at home you can do you can just grab this particular build and go from there so the other thing I'm gonna do first before we do the rendering actually yeah I'll do it first is I'm gonna install our add-on because we want to use that as well so I am going to [Music] just choose the next slot in which we're going to do adaptive sampling and we are going to the meantime just install the add-on and fingers crossed this doesn't crash everything and I have to start all over again ok so I download the add-on if you want to download the add-on you can just go to this URL discovery crowd render comm slash download if you have an account you'll just need to log in first if you don't you sign up and then you can get the software for free now we change this whole download page because it was causing confusion and was our fault sorry cause confusion everyone we've changed it so that supporters who you know paying some amount of month to support the project their builds are here this is an account amusing which isn't a supporter account so most people when they log in will see something like this so the supporter early access builds which are the latest available builds cutting or bleeding edge ones are here the publicly available ones which everyone should be able to download I here and these should work for 2.8 because this is what I am using right now so you're gonna watch me get this to work with 2.9 hopefully and drop any comments in the comment section if you want me to do any specific things in the next suit in the next few videos if you want me to do any demonstrations or deal with any particular bugs and stuff there'll be hopefully a card coming up in the video right now about a common issue with where you set your port numbers up for greater and grander needs port numbers like you have television channels it talks to other computers it uses ports to do that which I like TV channels and we've found an issue where apparently other services are using those channels and when we try and use them it stops connection from happening so if you're having trouble with connection watch this video right now hopefully I managed to do that okay and there's a card if not check the link in the description below they'll also be a link there okay cool so I've downloaded Oh - - and I'm gonna install it and hopefully it will work so let's do that if not I'll get it to work and you'll get to watch me troubleshoot it so this has no crowd runner on it at the moment 42.9 okay it installed fine and now we're gonna go start it so that's that now okay that looks pretty cool and yeah it asks for obviously because it's using the network you might get the firewall notification come up so I just click allow so make sure you do that and then I gotta put my password in for this computer and that should be it working so we're not going to do this straightaway we are going first you render so this was the first time three minutes 4638 and that one that is hundredths of a second I guess with no adaptive similarly this is just blender 2.9 out of the box and the settings for that are up here so 400 anti-aliasing samples 50% of the screen so it's kind of different I think there's another benchmark where it's set to 1225 samples I didn't want this to take too long because I'm pretty sure you would not find entertaining if I just rendered and you watched my computer slowly render because this is not a fast computer this one here that I'm working on it's like an i7 but it's only got four course doesn't have hyper threading which is a bit strange that it's an i7 doesn't have Viper throwing but it's I guess the el cheapo version so it's not the quickest something got four threads to render with okay so we are going to get back to our in the properties panel we're going to turn on adaptive sampling now I'm not gonna do anything else because really I guess I want to cater to all the people out there who are not really nerds into how render engines work and want to know about the ins and outs of adaptive sampling we're just going to look how it works when you have a scene like this and you just turn it on and you don't touch any other settings because there are other settings in here obviously noise threshold minimum samples we're gonna turn it on and see what saving we get so let's do that and I'm just gonna make sure I don't overwrite my other time so I'm gonna make sure I'm in the right slot which I'm not good job I checked let's do this bang oh yeah now it comes to the most entertaining part everybody where we just watch a computer render so we've got the last frame time up here so we got to beat three minutes 46 and it's looking pretty good it's definitely feels faster and time remaining suggests that we're gonna get a much better result I've already done this before and I know it does speed things up that I just wanted to show you guys for reals in front of all our very eyes that this does actually work and there's very little effort involved you just turn this thing on and let adaptive samples do its thing maybe in a future video we'll really go into all the numbers and do a whole bunch of benchmarking and find out where it's really effective where it's not so effective this really is just a out the box really naive shock it on see if it works because good software should do that and it does so hats off to all the guys doing the development behind blender because they've done a good job with adaptive samples as far as I can tell anyway cuz I didn't have any trouble getting to work my dear this is all CPU rendering I would really love to hear from other people who have you got a GPU if you've tried this let us know how well it works on the GPU or even if it does because this is all new it's actually in 2.83 but I decided just to use 2.9 because I'm some other people we use in 2.9 and so you asked me if it was if crowd runner is compatible with it so we're about to find out that as well we're about to find out if it's compatible 2.9 ok so one minute 40 to go it's got about a minute left which means it looks like it might be a minute faster it's not bad it's pretty good like shaving a minute baffi frames especially when the total frame time is three minutes 46 is pretty decent that's I'm going to do a calculation I mean it's not going to embarrass myself at my poor mental maths but we'll figure out how much faster that is in percentage terms and then we'll see how much further we can get the time down if we use another computer also with adaptive sampling the back in my head I'm thinking oh gosh I really hope I add on supports adaptive sampling if you change this setting we'll find out I guess okay wow that does feel a lot faster okay there you go so two minutes 29 versus three minutes 46 okay so it's two and a half minutes versus really four so what's that let's do the proper calculation shall we I'm pedantic like that sometimes calculator let's calculate some stuff all right oh this is where it gets really embarrassing I should have done this a spreadsheet or something I'm a programmer not a mental mathematician that is for sure so let's turn it in a second so we will do this one first so we've got 120 plus 30 is a hundred and fifty so let's just call it a hundred fifty no can I use a calculator then till challenge camp James use a calculator all right so that's 180 plus 15 to 30 it's got to thirty not bad so yeah it's about 65 percent in the render time all thereabouts I'm not going to do the percentage change that's just the percentage 150 is 65 percent of 230 so pretty good yeah it's about two thirds the render time which if it does if it does that scale so imagine you had a frame that took an hour and you can shave a third of time off that's pretty good like shaving the third of the time off is it's pretty good and one thing to note about I guess the mic pan scene is though it does take a few seconds let's just say it takes probably about 10 to 20 seconds depending on you CPU for it to start even drawing which is when the adaptive sampling kicks in so it's probably even a little bit better than that not a huge amount but I think the longer your frame time is the one with the drawing stage you might see a little bit better improvement in this percentage number but anyway that's what it does no multiple machines so if you find that oh my gosh my render time is just out of control and you like the idea of just coming and cutting a third off that this is pretty much for free you just load your project up in 2.9 turned on adaptive samplings and just give it a give it a go see how it works as long as I think your project is in 2.8 I don't think there's going to be many compatibility issues necessarily I've done this with a relatively simple project though mind you this project is not from 2.8 this is from a 2.7 and it seems to work okay mind you no animation no real fancy other stuff going on like scripts or drivers or any of that stuff so your mileage may vary if you've got a very complicated project then well see what happens okay so that's pretty cool right now let's chuck crab and on and add another computer and we will see if we can improve this so I've already got another computer set up it's just not showing itself which is fine I may not have it logged in we'll try and connect into it so you probably want to I probably want to actually no this is me probably want to tell you a little bit about how this is all set up so by the power of sketching I'm going very quickly show you how I've got things set up because I realize I haven't really got into that in the past and I don't want it to be too confusing so I have in my house this is my router so this is where all my networks plug into and then I've just got two PC's both of Windows PCs and yes this is very crude so forgive my drawing we've got one Ethernet cable one Ethernet cable and that's my setup this is really simple so this is basically the router that I got from my internet service provider when I bought my internet package and it's got four Ethernet ports on the back and I just plugged these two pcs into those two Ethernet ports they become part of my local network now and I'm currently screencasting from this guy which is render three PC whatever is and then I've got another computer running Windows 10 as well so both Windows 10 connected to a network with Ethernet cables fairly simple box down this stuff just in case you're wondering how with other things all right moving on oh it's actually active cool so this is the other computer I didn't see it as active before but it looks like it's actually okay now so let's connect to it there we go connecting up syncing sync failed oh that's not great hmm time for me to figure this out so guys if you have had this happen to you I can sympathize with you now because now I've got to fix it let's just try resyncing does that help yes well okay well that was easy hopefully it works for you as well if you have that issue hit the whole precinct button and maybe you'll get lucky now I'm just I'm just kidding guys and if you do have issues we do have a support system with tickets so you can support it you can submit a ticket for free obviously supporters get higher priority but you you know we try and get around to everybody we're doing most of this stuff in our spare time at the moment obviously so we're not miracle workers in terms of how quickly we can get around to all but we do have tickets and they persist in our system and we try and get through them as fast as we can so if you do have an issue check the description below there'll be a link there for submitting a support request if you're watching this video and hitting resync didn't work for you there you go alright so I guess we should render this now Hey yeah let's just do that let's just do that uh good old naive stick it in stick it in top gear and friggin well floor it okay so that's slot to that so let's just go through these again slot one no adaptive sampling no extra computers three minutes 46 salaat - adaptive sampling on just one computer 2 minutes 29 little R 3 better pride on the line here oh let's try and beat that time of two minutes two and a half minutes so I will go back here we've got the two machines synched so it's going to render on both of those this computer and the other one let's see what happens huh that's interesting they're not very well-balanced that's for sure oh boy liking it that's gonna take a while you know what I might do you know what I might do I might just go cancel let's just use manual mode so this is I guess an opportunity for me to explain how our software works and how it has some quirks which aren't particularly good the load balancing works off data that it's learned from previous frames because this is the first frame we've used it doesn't really have any data and it can do stupid stuff like a sign one pixel width worth of the image to render you can however fix that just by coming in here and going yeah manual and from memory this guy is probably worth about point four of the whole scene and the other guy point six because the other computer isn't as good it's an older CPU and not really as crash hot okay let's try again slot three I had to see what happens maybe it'll work better this time so that's just divided up the screen so they're sharing it in a way where one's getting in about 60% of the screen the other was getting about 40% of the screen and hopefully that works out reasonably well balanced it actually looks like I could have gone 70/30 because this one's still ahead this is the more modern machine this is the old one that's too bad I think I got it almost right this is something I've just done over time just guessing it many ORS really good if you get any results from just automatic mode and it's on auto by default when you install it so if you get sort of like very very poor render times on the first time you try it this is probably why and you can give manual mode ago just to see if you can get a better result you can actually turn like I could turn monile off right now and if this was an animation render and then it would switch back to automatic but use the results from manual which should hopefully give it better information to use all of this is going to become irrelevant pretty quickly because we're designing a brand new system which doesn't use this load balancer anymore so it will hopefully be a heck of a lot better it will also give you earlier feedback as well so you'll see frames come back way before the whole frame was finished so how we doing for time are we gonna make it is this am I gonna have to like really push my pride I think it's gonna be faster certainly because we're wasting time here because we're waiting for this other one so it could have been better balanced so I might try one more time well that's actually better considering these these computers are not like exactly the same so it should not have half the render time definitely the other pcs clearly weaker because it took way longer to finish and it was only doing 40% so I might just do one more it's a lot for so that's got a slot for and let's go to edit than y'all and I'll now give this guy about 0.35 no no I won't okay point three five there we go let's give that a shot again riveting entertainment James making everyone watch a blank screen with numbers flying past I do my best they were best to make this interesting all I can do at this point is watch and talk which I'm sure will bore the pants off many people but hopefully this does give me some idea of what to expect so if you've never used the system before I'm using the publicly available version 0.2 I'm using Windows 10 I'm using blender 2.9 which is not out yet and so far I managed to get work without really much trouble at all so if you are having problems please let us know it there's a chance we can make the software better for everybody if you tell us about issues you're having and we generally try and respond and work with you to get stuff up and running because we're really passionate about building a rendering system that eventually everyone's gonna have access to completely for free you have access to the publicly available builds for free right now but obviously we're building a new system that's in early access for all the supporters because they are supporting us so we wanted to give them something in return and eventually hopefully this will be open source and freely available like blenders we're not there yet though so please be patient with us we're getting there so you can check out our support sorry I support our development fund which is a similar idea to blender again link in the description below ok how did we do did we do any better ten seconds better or their opponents in several looks three minutes 46 no adaptive assembly one machine two minutes 29 adaptive sampling one minute 51 first go not particularly well balanced one minute thirty nine bit better balanced that's where that's where the adaptive sampling on as well I think so the last thing I'm going to do is I'm going to turned out assembling off and see what we can do with a reasonably well balanced system in crowd render okay synched so if I turn adaptive sampling on and off even in version 0.2 0.2 it synchronizes that change to the other node will have turned it's a template adaptive sampling off as well which means you don't have like this weird hybrid system although if to be honest if it didn't turn it off or on at least it will still render although it might be faster or slower than you expected to be so I'm just gonna hit render still again this is gonna take a little bit longer but again I'm just I'm keen to just see how this stuff works and hopefully you guys are as well so you're curious about how you can get your render times down I'm keen to see how our publicly available software performs with 2.9 for the first time this is the first time I've ever used it so with 2.9 like this so it's been really relieving and cool to see that it's worked pretty much first go albeit it did have that sync failure out of the box but it seemed that resynchronizing fix that straight away so come on so what are we gonna get we're gonna get two minutes maybe we'll get it looks like it could end up being a similar time to adaptive sampling on its own it's very very relieving that we actually get even more speed if we use two computers because what you definitely should but it's also pretty cool to see how much time adaptive sampling saves so maybe in the next video we'll look at really pushing the limits of adaptive sampling and seeing how much time we can actually save when we start tweaking and cuz I'm pretty sure a little bit more we could do because we've got settings for how much noise we're okay with we could also chuck the denoising node in there the optics noising that would be wicked because then we could use even less samples so I've been really keen to see how far down we could push this scene I'm not gonna do that today cuz I want it just to be short now want to experiment a bit as well because the last thing you guys want to do is sit through like a hundred of me tweaking and tuning but I think that's the next thing I'll do is play around for a bit them and show you guys how you can really drive the render times down using modern computers multiple computers my mouth will cooperate and adaptive sampling and denoising also be nice if we could get a GPU as well yeah here in the office so I can experiment with GPS but I don't have one at the moment kind of gonna have to save up for quite a while I think kovat has stopped supply and that's caused prices to go up a wee bit so it's not gonna be anytime soon unfortunately okay Oh two bits 32 minutes 30 no we're gonna go over because it's slightly imbalanced so oh man it's similar let me just say it's similar yeah two minutes forty so two minutes 29 adaptive sampling on one node and then 2 minutes 40 using two computers so it is a fairly similar time bearing in mind that my second computer is not as powerful as my master so master being this one where I'm actually controlling everything from it be nice to have three or four computers active because then we could really crunch the numbers down bit but there you go I hope that's been interesting so we've looked at adaptive sampling and it seems to work pretty well out of the box I'm gonna keep this video short because I don't want to drag on too much I'd like to come back and explore it more with you guys when I know a little bit more about how adaptive sampling works and next time we might use version Oh point two point six so that is the currently available version for in early access because this supports denoising and whereas this one does not however I am going to do my usual plug of development fund because like I said we do want to have keep a software project free for everybody so we don't want to release a brand-new system and then just go back to the age on a model of selling the software we kind of like the whole development fun thing that blenders got going it seems like a really nice model because everyone need to have a go then everyone gets access to it so here's the Development Fund I've got to update this but it's still about sort of 800 and we're wanting to get to this point where we can start unlocking some of these builds which would be really really cool again this is just we want to make sure I ventually the whole thing is available for free I have to update this because this information I don't think it's particularly helpful I don't I did it but I don't like it so I'm going to change it because I want you guys to have certainty about what we're doing so the idea about this is the target here is me working part time because at the moment I don't I work on this project completely for free but it'd be really awesome if we could hire the whole team back so I'd be me Jeremy Chris Mamie Martin part-time we could do that so we're working towards getting the development team working on this project full-time so that's what our Development Fund is about and as we get more and more funding we want to obviously unlock more and more of the software because there are obviously improvements in these builds and you can also now I think click on these and they should bring up the changes it's not a change log but it's just a brief description about them so like like I said we've made some change to the website which are hopefully pleasing so you can sign up you can get access to the latest event really latest early access builds not really available ones we've changed this website to be like the downloads page to be a little bit more clear to read hopefully it is again drop us a comment if it's miss want to use the word misleading but if it's not clear or if you think it's misleading then yeah sure let us know because we change this whole layout because someone basically said hey you say your software's free but then I can't download the latest build for 2.8 there it is we've made it hopefully clearer for you guys to be able to see it and if you like what we're doing if you're into the idea of this becoming you know the I suppose the render farm equivalent of blender because that's what we would like it to be then yeah sign up and support us you'll be joining you know 150 odd people if you count the $4 subs plus the ten and all the rest of it who really believe what we're doing has been supporting us since I think December last year so that would be awesome we'd love your support tell us what you think of the videos guys I want to keep doing him I'm going to start doing some live streaming for the people who do sign up they'll be some exclusive live streams which will give you a chance to obviously ask questions they'll be on some advanced topics and also get your opinions and thoughts on the new software which we'll be demonstrating and that's pretty much all I have so hope you liked it please like share and subscribe because that really helps your voice if you like what we're doing counts a hell of a lot more than ours because obviously we are the people behind this project we can shout all we like about how great we think it is but if someone else are you guys tell other people how great it is your voice actually speaks louder than us ever could so really appreciate all the support we've been getting from people who've been sharing on Twitter Facebook or just telling friends through whatever medium you feel is appropriate so thanks to all those guys thanks to all our supporters who are on this page I've already given them a plug in a thank-you video but I think you guys deserve another thing so go and check out our donation page there's some awesome people's names on there who are supporting it and that's pretty much all I got for today so see the next video cheers guys right
