 RSI help YouTube today we have a very special guest Dr. Robert Markison. He's a hand surgeon from San Francisco he's a clinical professor of surgery at the University of California San Francisco and he's at 40 years of experience with the hand today he's going to tell us about a very interesting and timely connection between Covid 19 and repetitive strain injury so welcome back to the show dr. Markuson please tell us what you've been observing obviously I've seen some horrors and I see yous in San Francisco people who just didn't make it out and so you have to really start thinking about co-head not as a threat that keeps you up worried at night but you have to consider how to be at your best in terms of adaptive immunity the two elements are personal adaptive immunity and then herd immunity you can't push the whole herd but you can help yourself and so just in terms of health maintenance amid risk of Kogut I believe that masks even if they're not those n95 could be helpful but as you use a mask you if you have to work with a mask all day then it can cause hypoxia and desaturation measurable desaturation if you use a pulse oximeter on a finger you can desaturate with sustain mask use so be careful about it because you don't want to be running hypoxic because all the tissues including those that are strained repetitively need oxygen they really scarf it up for my part which may seem like an old man in a nursing home but I'm proud of it I just use the portable oxygen concentrator and so what that means is that I've got pulsed oxygen under my mask Wow right so that just means there we are so I can kind of kind of set this and give myself 22 ml of 93 to 96 percent oxygen or 55 ml through a scale whatever I need so I never run hypoxic as measured with a digital pulse oximeter I like to be saturated in 97 98 99 percent that seems a little obsessive-compulsive but I don't regret it so portable oxygen concentrator they can be a little spendy but there are a lot of sales currently because that's there they're coming into increased use also apropos self preservation and protection anybody who snores whether they have to get a polysomnography formal sleeps lab study or not should be considering CPAP and talk to their doctor about CPAP continuous positive airway pressure because that'll keep your Airways open you just use the little nasal thing only nasal pillows if if you're a nose breather if you're a mouth-breather need a little bigger mask but CPAP goes a long way and what they've found in studies that far predated kovat is that first of all Cove is about a cytokine storm that can kill you what are cytokines well they're inflammatory mediators elaborated by cells that turn on too fast too hard too long and shed all this inflammation into all tissues and so the the opportunistic pathways the sinuses all those sinuses don't get involved then the big enchilada is the lungs you spread about you've got a huge service area those are the vulnerable metros and so if your lungs are closing down a little bit within snoring sleep apnea apnea hypopnea events during sleep then you're in a drizzle of cytokines all day way before the pandemic so if you don't want the drizzle to become a storm because the the more the lungs collapse atelectasis micro electus is the more stormy it guess goes from a drizzle to a shower and deadly storm keep those lungs fresh and open you don't have to swim the English Channel you don't have to run the marathon you take a nice walk or a nice dip without straining yourself and keep those lungs fresh but during sleep if you're snoring based on a bed partner telling you so or whatever you know waking up with air hunger get into a little CPAP it's going to protect you tremendously now my go ahead what about yogic breathing some of the breathing practices you know you inhale eight you exhale sixteen there you inhale two it's two to one breathing so you're really taking a deep breath and then you're slowly pushing there's also you know the practices that sort of expel the air from the bottom of the lungs out there's twisting practices that you can do with the breath do you think those are helpful I think they're tremendously helpful absolutely essential great to expand the lungs sit up don't slouch proper posture and stuff you you've been talking about it appropriately for decades and you know taking a nice walk you know again it doesn't have to be run people are overdoing the physical exercise and hurting themselves that way but that's important to bring you brought up a great point yes for anything extremely important as a wind instrument player I like my highest resistance wind instruments and rather than a flute where you just blow it all out without positive airway pressure you know if you're playing reed instruments a little trumpet or whatever it is what about our monitor harmonica is not is not resistance it can be helpful to expand the lungs but a little bit of positive airway pressure goes a long way harmonicas not bad but again I like a little resistance I don't have CPAP going all day see tap machines if necessary had become wonderful and they they automatically synchronize with your breathing and you will find again 90 so we're previously CPAP non-compliant compliant raising their way through a light case of combat didn't get worse now as far as repetitive strain injury yes of course it can get worse if you are hypoxic even a mild mild case so you're gonna have to back off on typing another hypermetabolic oxygen consuming that you considered hypoxia what's the side you want to be above 95 percent oxygen saturation I mean people can tolerate going going below 90 but I've seen patients who desaturate and so if they're in the office and they're not infectious and they've already passed coated and they're there now positive antibodies and so they're pretty immune for the future but I'll just put a little oxygen ok so just check that out as they wear a mask and they keep chatting and see if they desaturate and so you don't want to desaturate whether your doing repetitive activity the whole body weren't so an oxygen and microcirculation so from what i hear you say it sounds like it's not a good idea to wear a mask all day and i'm thinking of these people who are going back into offices and they're they're wearing their masks and maybe getting a little desaturated so maybe it's better to work at home so you can breathe normally without a mask is that what I'm hearing yes and I obviously the new new workplace is going to be largely remote it doesn't mean never look at another person and have a face to face real conversation but I think for the interim this kind of uncertain duration probably better to be masculine as much as you safely can be okay there anything else you want to tell us about thriving during this pandemic well yeah I mean everybody wants to order out and I get that the convenience and so on but it's the uncertainty of the the foodstuffs that you're getting and it doesn't mean you have to become Julia Child all of a sudden but home cooking with plenty of grains you know veggies and some truth low leptin diet and lectins or what plants make so plants won't be eaten lectins break down the intercellular junctions between intestinal cells permitting leakage of inflammatory mediators out of the gut into weak targets like muscles nerves brain and so on and so low leptin diet if you're lactose intolerant respect it if you can handle some yogurt for other lactose fermented stuff use it avoid any alcohol no tobacco no e-cigarettes these are things stay well hydrated these are things that are some like basics but they make a huge difference probiotics with a prebiotic to feed on probably a good idea many good brands out there don't spend a fortune on it sin biotics sy and biotics are coming in and those are strain specific bacteria that help you do everything from stay well to make insulin to make thyroid hormone matched strained by strain with the proper prebiotic in the same capsule that's kind of the future next step evolution syn biotics but take some of that without breaking the bank take your vitamin D liquid form because capsules don't work gel caps don't work take a liquid g3 maintain a d3 hydroxy D level of 50 to 80 nanograms per ml with Inlet in sync with Rheumatology literature take a b vitamin supplement and preferably chewable so that says slowly to better absorbed those are things that are important and what foods are the lectins and is that any fruit vegetable or night-night shades are a bit mentorians because those are tomatoes potatoes peppers and eggplant you're talking about plants that have been around for eons the initial threats of plants was maybe 300 million years ago an insect started to eat them so they made all these lectins concentrated in skin concentrated in seeds so you look up a low leptin content food list on the internet and then just decide to move away from one gluten gluten is a very potent lectin and hello elective diets a low inflammatory diet that will best maintain good intent thank you so much for sharing this knowledge and I hope you come back soon I'm sure we'll get questions for you I have questions for you but we've already taken so much of your time and I want to thank you thank you thank you for coming on the show and thank everybody for watching and please subscribe and if you have any questions for dr. Marcus enter me you can put it in the comments box and we will see what we can do then answering it alright thank you until next time thank you
