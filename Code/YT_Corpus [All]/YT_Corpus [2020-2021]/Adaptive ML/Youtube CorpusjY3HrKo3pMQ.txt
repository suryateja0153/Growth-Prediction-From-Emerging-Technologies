 now I want to talk to you pressure control some of you use it commonly and some of you do not but in case you do we have enhanced a little bit of the pressure control on the 92 ventilator in terms of the monitoring aspects so let's look at the setup of pressure control under the mode setup you select invasive it could also be non invasive pressure control I'm gonna stick with invasive for now and then you have a cyst controlled PC you can also have si and V PC as well I'll stick with AC for right now and then as you look at some of your other settings you have to determine like and volume control what the rates going to be you know determine the actual pressure you're going to use to ventilate and that will determine the total volume based upon that patients compliance and resistance you determine the inspiratory time and so for now I'll just put it at maybe a second somewhere in there and then the rest of your traditional settings that you're used to the sensitivity the o2 percentage high peak pressure and the peep and then finally you also have a rise time the rise time basically determines how fast that breath goes in and achieves that target pressure the higher the number the faster the breath will go in the lower the number the slower the breath will go in then there are three locks on the bottom and you have an inspiratory lock or you have a middle lock which we call the IO ratio lock and that will change the primary setting finally you also have an expert Ori lock and so you decide how much kind of lock you want to use based upon the strategy that you're familiar uncomfortable with I'm going to go back to this inspiratory lock for now now when we use pressure control there's always the variable of how much total time you're giving to your patient and so for example right now I'm set at 15 stammers water pressure and as I look at my screen up on top if I look at my exhale Tolliver I'm getting about 404 milliliters of exhaled online but the question is is that the appropriate size or not and some of you may have targets on mil per kilogram and so what we have done is we've actually enhanced the monitoring screen on the top and for example I can watch that patients compliance because we know us compliance changes that can affect the total volume change as with the resistance but the next parameter displayed right here is the total volume which is really the mill per kilogram and right now I'm at 5.2 mils per kilogram and that may be the appropriate target based upon what your needs are if for example I turn up this pressure quite a bit we'll see what happens here so now I'm using quite a bit more I'm using 30 centimetres of pressure and that 30 centimetres of pressure is on top of the People v and so it's going to go up to a total of 35 centimeters notice up on the top it says 9.5 mils per kilogram that may exceed your targets when it comes to lung protective strategies and so at this point you can analyze that real-time and post that on the upper screen anytime you want and so with that please refer to the operator's manual for any additional questions in the operation of fresh control ventilation [Music] you
