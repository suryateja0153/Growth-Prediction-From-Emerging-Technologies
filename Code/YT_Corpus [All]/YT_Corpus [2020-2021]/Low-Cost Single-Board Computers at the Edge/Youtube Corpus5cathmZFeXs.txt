 [Music] tonight donald trump joe biden face to face on the debate stage for the first time i think i prepare every day i can hardly wait to debate it will the president go for personal attacks against by people say he was on performance enhancing guns and can biden keep the focus on the pandemic and trump's record it's bizarre the things he's saying and doing with regard to kobe a political clash months in the making is about to begin good evening i'm chuck todd and welcome to nbc news's special coverage of the 2020 presidential debates right here on nbc news now 35 days until election day and right now we are now just one hour from the start of this first debate between president trump and former vice president joe biden the first of three scheduled debates by the way you're looking live at the debate site in cleveland ohio where a socially distanced crowd will be in attendance everyone in that debate hall is being tested for the coronavirus and everyone other than the candidates and the moderator will be wearing a mask there will be no pre-debate handshake and not even an elbow bump those are just a few of the reminders tonight that this debate is taking place amid a raging global pandemic that has killed more than 200 000 people in the united states and over a million people across the world and it is unfortunately surging again in quite a few states tonight both sides are gearing up for a fight over a number of issues but expect the virus to be a major topic one of biden's biggest challenges may be his ability to stay focused on the president's handling of the pandemic the president well expect him to try to steer the debate in other directions any other direction other than the pandemic they'll obviously want to speak about the economy and perhaps make uh make the issue of unrest in american cities a bigger deal as the front-runner in this race former vice president joe biden has the most to lose tonight his performances during the democratic primary debates were to be charitable uneven at best and trailing in the polls president trump is expected to attack biden in highly personal terms as we've seen from past debates the president and his team are no strangers to employing tactics that would otherwise signal desperation or maybe that's exactly what they're signaling desperation let's dive right in let's head to cleveland and catch up with our nbc news reporters following the campaign allie jackson's inside the debate hall following president trump and mike memoly is socially distanced outside the debate hall following vice president joe biden so hallie you're inside that hall you know the buzz of a presidential debate without people in attendance it's gotta be odd it's different right and i was actually talking to somebody who has done these things before and talked about yeah you come in and typically you do some networking you go around you know the hall would be filling up by now an hour before the debate you talk to people you see what's up it is definitely not like that i'm looking behind me i just want to kind of show you here so the seats are not socially distant the seats themselves but there are signs that you can't see from this angle that say you know don't sit here we're enforcing social distance so people will be spaced out inside the auditorium people will be sort of in family pods as well you're seeing every single person here is in a mask that's not because they want to be maybe they do it's because they have to be right every one of us is required to wear a mask the only exceptions are going to be the three people who will be on the stage behind me there and that is moderator chris wallace and then both of the presidential candidates everybody needs a covent test as well and i think you set it up nicely at the top of your show here chuck that is a very vivid reminder of the backdrop to all this which is the coronavirus pandemic it is going to come up it is going to be an issue in this debate tonight and joe biden's team as mike memoline well knows is going to be looking to go potentially for the jugular here against president trump the president for his part uh has arrived in cleveland and what is his campaign talking about listen they're talking about earpieces they're talking about you know this potential drug test these conspiracy theories that have gained a lot of traction online about joe biden uh and and that is sort of the the thinking there now there's other pieces to this too i do think you're going to hear something about hunter biden joe biden's son some attacks against him that is something that campaign aides have been previewing frankly for the last 24 hours would be surprising to not hear that president trump and just to give you an indication of where that's going who's been helping the president prep for this debate rudy giuliani somebody who has been among sort of trump world allies the person who has been leading those attacks against hunter biden and so i do think that gives you a sense of of the deal here we do understand that rudy giuliani is going to be here as one of the guests inside the debate hall tonight another guest chuck alice marie johnson we understand she of course is the grandmother whose life sentence was pardoned by president trump on a drug conviction as part of his work on criminal justice reform so there will be people in the audience for the president it's about highlighting he hopes and people around him are hoping his sort of second term what he would do if you want again but as you well know chuck this is a president that often uh likes to sort of ish air grievances that have happened before so we'll see how that goes i was just going to say hallie until the second you mentioned that i was going to ask does the president have any plans to try to tell people what he wants to do in his second term because he never has his entire focus on this campaign has been through the lens of of trying to uh delegitimize joe biden are they that empty right now but you know it's interesting chuck the people around the president don't they want him to be talking about a second term right when you talk to everybody but the president there is a discussion of hey he's going to be laying out this vision for a second term some of these concrete pieces but when the rubber meets the road it's the president himself who in a setting like this is going to have to deliver on that and that's a big question mark here tonight mike emily it seems as if is the joe biden's biggest challenge is going to be navigating whatever whatever wwe antic that that donald trump throws at him um does he have what it takes to take over the debate though and not just be sitting there having to respond or perry or where he will he will take control of this debate seems to me that's his biggest challenge well chuck there was a 70-something candidate for president who about two decades three decades ago in a presidential debate used a very successful retort against his opponent there you go again and you wonder if that's exactly the kind of thing we're going to hear from joe biden a lot tonight one thing i've heard from aides who've been involved in the debate prep is you know perhaps you pre-conditioned the audience in the earliest opportunity possible to say listen america we know who donald trump is it's something biden has said often on the campaign trail we need to tell them who we are but the other thing about this chuck is you use the right term those 11 debate performances we saw in the presidential primaries were uneven but why is joe biden the nominee because joe biden sold himself to democrats as the best candidate to go toe-to-toe with donald trump and despite all those uh uneven debate performances democrats believe that was true he took the fight to donald trump in the very first moments of his candidacy in that video and so that's the democrat people want to see on stage tonight they want to see joe biden take the fight to him but chucky wonder if this approach would be different if he was trailing versus ahead and i think for the two prime time debate performances joe biden had in 2008 against sarah palin in 2012 against paul ryan in 2008 he was the the you know on defense stand back you had to be very careful debating sarah palin especially when they were in the lead in 2012 after barack obama had a very weak debate performance against mitt romney they needed joe biden to turn it up to a 12 and go really for the jugular against paul ryan light some fire into the ticket biden really has a difficult balancing act i think to play tonight because he does need to show that fight and by now they say he wants to bring the fight but so much of the preparation has also been about how to play defense how do you deal with president trump's attacks and that's we'll see how that prep plays out because one thing chuck and all the conversations we'd have with by now is before other debates they'd you know preview his approach for the night and then we'd see something entirely different on stage and there's no predicting what we're going to see especially against donald trump tonight very quickly hallie gave me a roster of people that are showing up for trump who's showing up for biden well we know dr biden's going to be there his sister valerie is also going to be there one of the uh invited guests is kristin urkisa that's a familiar name she of course had a big role at the democratic convention saying her father had only one pre-existing condition before his death of covid which was trusting donald trump that's it we don't know if any other members of the biden family obviously a big question as we know hunter biden will be part of the debate tonight if not in the audience himself ali jackson and mike memoly at the debate site one inside one outside both wearing masks stay healthy to the both of you let's now head over to steve kornacki the big board let's just might as well have a check the state of the race where we are heading into the first debate so steve i'm trying to think the last time a candidate had this large of a lead going into a first presidential debate i guess you got to go back to bill clinton and bob dole in 1996. last time yep yeah in the last time an incumbent president went into a debate behind 92 george h.w bush and of course that's the last incumbent to lose here it is this is the nbc polling average north of eight points biden's advantage it's been steady it's been consistent that's what trump is up against in this thing and of course there's that question of how many people saying in these polls they've already made up their minds can you get people maybe who think that way to reconsider it that might be part of the challenge here the other thing is we know the topics that are going to be addressed in this debate tonight at least according to the moderator chris wallace he put a list out and we've got some polling here on what voters think on these issues the economy this is polling that's come out in the last couple weeks who do you trust on this issue who do you prefer on this issue variations on that this is trump's advantage it's consistent this is our poll here at 10 point advantage 4838 on the economy there is of course this issue of crime and violence safety in in the streets you've got a slight and i mean slight 43-41 edge there for trump then there's supreme court the supreme court the vacancy trump as he's nominated amy coney barrett who do you trust more on filling supreme court vacancies biden is the one who's got the advantage there we've seen that in a couple polls now and then it starts to build for biden you get to the coronavirus double digit advantage there for biden on the coronavirus and race relations something else wallace says will come up tonight that's the biggest issue advantage you see for biden over trump and there's one more it will come up tonight we weren't sure how to measure this in the polling it's the question of election integrity that's going to play a role tonight this is from a recent cnn poll they asked first of all does the loser of the election have an obligation to accept the results and concede overwhelmingly the answer is yes there the follow-up is okay do you think trump do you think biden if they're defeated will accept the results and concede about two-thirds said they think biden will barely one-third said they think trump will if that were to happen you know steve what jumped out at me in that presentation on issues that on that even on donald trump's best issue he can't break 50. yeah he doesn't break 50 no matter how you measure it even on his best issue of the economy you look at biden we see him breaking 50s in battleground states we see him breaking 50s when it comes to trust issues you're just not seeing that with the president right now it's that question how many people who say they just definitely won't vote for him or think about it is that number already too high for him it could very well be um and that's why this debate might be the uh only debate that has a chance to impact this race we'll see steve kornacki thank you for getting this started so joining me now as she always does for these big nights on nbc news now is casey hunt nbc news capitol hill correspondent and host of way too early on msnbc joshua johnson host of the week with joshua johnson on msnbc and michael bechlas our nbc news presidential historian casey uh let me start with this and i want to get everybody in on this but i want to start with you at the end of the day the president's behavior uh today and yesterday um is this the behavior of somebody that thinks he can win an election well it certainly doesn't seem like it's someone who thinks that he is going to win an election i mean as you just walked through pretty well with mike memoly how candidates normally think of things when they go in on top is certainly not what we have seen from president trump who is essentially trying to uh you know he's embraced a conspiracy theory about joe biden's earpiece and you know potentially what he is ingesting before taking the stage what's that really setting up for it's setting up for donald trump to be able to make an argument that joe biden cheated in the debate if it's very clear that joe biden comes out as you know what we may define as the winner in this in this debate or at least you know comes out after delivering a strong performance and you know that's the tactic that donald trump has taken time and time again and it's the groundwork that he's laying for the election as a whole you know as as reflected in those numbers that steve kornacki had about whether americans believe that they'll these guys are going to accept the results of the election joshua johnson it it does i think present you know at the end of the day we know donald trump is donald trump and in some ways i don't know if there's new information that's going to be learned by anybody tonight the new information is in joe is about is going to be with sort of joe biden how does he handle trump it it seems to me it's in some ways it could be a trap you know is he better off just ignoring the wwe antics or does he have to does he have to punch him a little good question i think there will be some punching i'm pretty sure we could expect at least one or two punches to be thrown but you know that old adage about wrestling with a pig you just get dirty and the pig has fun i think that the biden campaign knows that if you look at some of the campaign ads that have been running in the last few weeks one of them is just part of the democratic national committee speech that he gave there's no music there's no effects there aren't even any fades in it it's just him giving a very presidential style speech and i think that's on purpose i think the idea is to paint joe biden as someone who could actually be a presidential ish president who feels like a president as opposed to president trump who rose to power by making it very clear that he wasn't that kind of a person that he was a businessman and a bomb thrower that is why i think as casey mentioned rightly a lot of what we've heard from the trump campaign is that same kind of bomb throwing you know anti-washington establishment behavior that kind of swept him into office whether or not he's going to engage on that i don't know i don't know politically what makes the most sense in terms of grabbing that 11 percent of voters that our polling has shown haven't settled 100 on a candidate yet but based on we've heard from him so far unless the president makes it personal unless he comes after his family he may or may not even bother to go after donald trump frankly i think he's better off just talking policy if the american people are overwhelmed by the last four years and they're ready for things to just calm down i think the fact that joe biden is sleepy might be the best thing for his campaign because there are millions of americans who would really like to rest right now michael beschloss as a historian there's there's no historical parallel to donald trump nobody is right nobody has ever tried to take the wwe and and and apply it to presidential debates but this is what he did he did it four years ago he's doing it again my greatest fear is that it's normalizing american politics i'm watching more uh candidates farther down the ballot using anti-antics like his or tactics like his thinking that this is the way to succeed how i have to say how are we going to get rid of that virus out of our politics well i think what happens is if donald trump tries that tonight and you're so right chuck you notice that on his list of personal guests as a ufc fighter so i guess that's a metaphor for what he's going to try tonight but if you look back through history and i don't think it's changed in 2020 the guy who walks off the stage tonight where people say that someone who looks like a president that's going to be the person who won so donald trump as a president as an incumbent may be making a mistake because look at the first three sets of debates in history each one was a perfect setting for an incumbent to be cut down to size richard nixon in 1960 was trying to make the point you know john kennedy as a young back denture not up to my stature i who've debated nikita khrushchev and served at dwight eisenhower's side for eight years by the end of that first debate a lot of people said jfk looks more presidential 1976 gerald ford the incumbent president was saying jimmy carter has no foreign policy experience then on the second debate uh ford behaves like a donkey or that's uh there's a party ref association with donkeys so i won't use that term but behaves in a really dumb way by saying there's no soviet domination of eastern europe and people wondered this is the guy who knows about foreign policy jimmy carter looked more presidential ronald reagan in 1980 right in cleveland the same city we're talking about tonight proved himself a president so we may see that tonight with joe biden you know and and casey i think that's you know i've heard a lot of folks try to make the 1980 comparison more than any right and there is some you know jimmy carter um was sort of came out of nowhere to be president donald trump came out of nowhere to be president jimmy carter fired his cabinet halfway through there was always kind of turmoil always was getting so i understand some of the parallels i think do apply um a lot of them don't um this is not comparing the two men on character it's not even you can't even make that comparison or things like that but that there is this idea that boy all biden has to do is show up if he looks presidential it's game over and the other two debates may not matter do you buy that conventional wisdom casey well first of all i completely agree with you on jimmy carter and donald trump it's hard to imagine two men of more uh polar opposite character in terms of power our history of in presidential politics uh but i i do think chuck that there's some truth to that i mean what would really shake up this relatively stable race where biden seems to have a sizeable lead where he has been successfully it seems making the argument that he has been making for the entire campaign and he has this going for him right if you have a consistent message it works much better than if you're all over the map trying to figure out what you stand for he's been saying i stand for a return to normalcy i stand for a return to decency and i think one of the things that's in his favor is that it's pretty easy to continue that on the debate stage in the face of nasty attacks from donald trump it's not as though his responses necessarily are going to counter the basics of that message but you know i do think there's bigger risks for biden because the race is so stable so if for some reason there is something that happens tonight that shakes that up or shakes people's confidence in biden's ability to do the job that would really be a problem for him and i think they know that and i think we also have come to know president trump and i don't think anyone is going to be surprised or shocked by what he delivers tonight and that is by the way different than 2016. back when there were a lot of americans who maybe they were paying attention to the republican primary as a sideshow but really their first experience of donald trump as a possible actual president was in those debates against hillary clinton that's just not the case anymore so joshua and this is all purely speculative but if donald trump has a poor debate performance tonight what's the likelihood he shows up for the other two i think it's probably about 100 with zero rounding error because if there's one thing we know about donald trump from his entire life his business career the providence of which is now under question after the reporting from the new york times it's that he will not admit defeat he does not admit loss he doesn't back down he's a student is that when you get hit hit 10 times harder deny deny deny i do not buy the idea that he won't show up because it'd be too easy for the biden campaign to show see see we told you we told you the minute that you hit him that whole paper tiger falls right apart didn't even burn just blew away a pile of ashes not even paper see this is exactly who donald trump really was i don't believe that he personally will let the biden campaign hold that over him now you may be right i hear what you're saying that he may try to take his ball and go home and say ah i knew the debates were rigged i knew it was it was flimsy i knew it was phony but i i i i've read too much shakespeare and too many greek tragedies to not believe in hubris i just don't buy necessarily that he's willing to say okay i got i got whipped i i think the risk especially you know especially looking at the guest list you mentioned the ufc fighter colby covington coley covington just got in trouble for saying some very racially insensitive things about you just fought in the ring uh this happened in the usc match i'm shocked well yeah yes but i just don't i think the people that he's surrounding himself with tonight the messaging he's had so far even saying that the debates are rigged in the news conferences last week he was saying i'm not really preparing for the debate prepare all the time i do my job that's my preparation for the debates the idea is he can walk in sweep the floor with joe biden and walk away i may be wrong but nothing in his character suggests that he's okay conceding defeat on any level oh i never said he'd concede defeat he just would come up with a new way of saying i'm going to hold my own debates or i'm going to hold my own thing or i'm going to do my i here's to himself biden gets the entire stage on every major broadcast network to himself i don't think donald trump's gonna let him have it no look at the end of the day it's donald trump so all of us are gonna find out in real time casey joshua and michael you guys stick around i'm going to sneak a break in here up ahead we're going to hear from some swing voters in tonight's debate uh in the great state of ohio about what they're hoping to hear tonight but first all this hour we're also going to share some memorable moments from first presidential debates in years past emphasizing the word first let's go back to 2012 and this moment with barack obama and mitt romney and moderator jim lehrer [Music] the president began this segment so i think i get the last word so i'm going to take i'm going to get the first in the next segment well but he gets the first word of that segment i get the last word that says well i hope let me just make this comment [Music] this is a situation where the state continues to struggle to expand its testing capabilities protesters feel that they need to come out in full force and support their community because they feel like they're not getting that support from the portland police another election day coming up against the backdrop of how to keep voters safe amid a pandemic the moment to truly understand who we are and who we say we are is right here at our feet you gotta get a four-year degree but a four-year degree is super expensive we have created a system where the ticket to the middle class is a thing that middle-class families have to stress about and borrow for and patch together why is this happening with chris hayes subscribe now you're watching nbc news now we've got some breaking news we actually saw a large convoy of the national guard come through here it's news made for your streaming world live weekdays starting at 6 a.m eastern this morning across the country what the new normal for schools will look like many teachers left making tough choices between the job they love and their family when i get aside take care of my children or have a job that's an impossible decision you're creating a little community school this is the moment we can just develop ourselves and develop our community let's turn it over to students how do they really feel about returning to school what i miss is my teachers they are resilient [Music] a surge in coronavirus infection new developments on several fronts the story tonight the u.s shattering the record for most coveted cases in a single day from every angle what's your level of concern that the kids who have been told they're going to be home indefinitely won't be able to catch up on the ground do you have faith that this is going to bring about change soon and in depth here in portland more protests expected tonight do you think that police in this country are under attack nbc nightly news with lester holt the news business is dynamic and probably has never been more important with all that we're facing i am so proud to bring the perspective of a black woman a daughter of immigrants the wife and mother of a husband and kids who sadly are more vulnerable to police violence because of their color a proud nerd and a representative of the emerging america to cable tv news i hope the great gwen eiffel and my mom philomena carolina will look down from heaven and be proud welcome back while we might get a hundred million viewers for tonight's debate the number of undecided voters watching tonight will be a lot smaller than 100 million we don't even know if there's a million of them these days polling shows that most voters minds are already made up heading into tonight's first debate but we swear there are a handful of undecideds out there our polling says there is at least 10 of them our msnbc senior national correspondent chris chancey sat down with a couple of them swing voters in suburban cleveland near the site of tonight's debate near where chris where you grew up i know find out what they'll be watching for these are in ohio they know what it's like to be courted as a swing voter and we didn't think they were going to be swing voters when this year started but they are right now in fact chuck i told my family at the beginning of the year don't expect me to be coming around very much during the election year because ohio's not a swing state anymore it tells you what my prognostication skills are look there's a reason that this has always been so important there is no state bragging a little bit that has predicted more accurately the presidential winner 1964 since then always ohio went with the winner having said that as i look at this year i thought okay this is going to be very much issues oriented for what i think seven percent is what the polls now show of the people who are undecided here because the unemployment rate is higher than the national average coronavirus hospitalizations are on the way up and yet when i talk to undecided voters the word that keeps coming up chuck over and over and over again is character here's part of my conversation with those voters i historically side republican this year i feel particularly just undecided because of the personalities trump turns you off oh yes yeah but you still might vote for him because of the policies i might what's going to make the difference in the debate i would like to see if the president can tone down the rhetoric if it's less about him and more about the questions and in both cases i'd like to see if they could answer the question and be civil can trump be civil can biden put together a comprehensive thought i don't think there's any one specific issue or you know policy that i'm i'm looking to get an answer to it i want to see how joe is able to handle himself under the fire that he's going to get from the president are you nervous for him i have some concerns we talked to a lot more voters on the phone and one of the things that's really resonating that trump has said chuck along with his supporters is joe biden's age the other thing hunter biden watch for that tonight we're actually in this beautiful backyard because those folks are going to come back here we're going to watch the debate along with them we'll see if their minds are changed or if they're swayed one way or another chuck fascinating how much the issue of of biden's mental acuity has made its way into those comments that you have there it says a lot about the power of the president's messaging fascinating chris jansing thank you with me now are two men who know a thing or two about preparing a candidate for a debate john podesta chair of hillary clinton's 2016 campaign founder of the center for american progress and lonnie chen policy director for mitt romney's 2012 presidential campaign and now a fellow at stanford's hoover institution john podesta i hope you just heard that last segment because to me it's sort of an interesting little issue that the biden campaign has i think it's a strength perhaps um but i'm curious this this lingering issue it's certainly had a huge assist from fox news prime time in some of the conservative mediocre chamber but the president has been on this idea that joe biden can't put a sentence together going into a first debate is this could biden have asked for a better bar to clear with that voter that we just spoke with i don't think so actually chuck i think he needs to he really needs to get his positive message out not get sucked in by uh donald trump's who i think has to change the dynamic of this race will be on the attack from the get-go uh you know he has a formula i'm great you suck uh you know here's the uh reason why you know you're you're going to be terrible for the american people i think what biden has to do is rather than getting a tit-for-tat he just has to demonstrate that he's got a plan for the country uh that he delivers that with seriousness on on covid on the economy uh and i think he'll do fine john podesta do you think he's got a doe take a couple of swings at trump i mean there's one thing of ignoring most of the attacks but can he afford to ignore them all no you know look i think he's got a critique of trump that's very deep and that he will be able to to have plenty of opportunity they're going to do 15 minutes on covet 19. so i think that uh he has plenty of hits that he can deliver on trump i think what is a would be a mistake for him is to try to kind of get into this uh crosstalk that trump likes to get into he should just make sure that he knows exactly what that critique is he pounds away at it and if trump you know gets really nasty attacks his family etc i think he can square off and you know people are worried about his temper i think there are moments where seeing you temporarize a little bit is actually helpful yeah michael dukakis was criticized for not losing his temper arguably i was i was i was in a room and my heart sunk when i saw that doing debate response the election was over at that point uh lonnie chen i i i hesitate to say what should donald trump do tonight look you've you've had to prep more traditional candidates for president for presidential debates this is an untraditional i guess if you could get into his head and reprogram him what would you have an incumbent president do tonight who's down seven points with a raging virus if he were a sort of more traditional incumbent president struggling for reelection well i mean chuck you heard it from those undecided voters in ohio i would have him talk about what his plans are for the next four years i'd have him talk about the economy it's an issue uh in all the polling we've seen recently the nbc news poll from over the weekend other media outlets the economy is a natural strength for the president notwithstanding where things have been since the covet 19 lockdown so i would really have him think carefully about what are the various points on the economy you can emphasize even looking back at the first term the record right they can talk about what they've done with china they can talk about uh some of the the manufacturing that's come back they can talk about the regulatory relief and the tax relief so there are elements of the president's record he can talk about elements of the plan going forward he should emphasize but that would be kind of untrue to who donald trump is right donald trump is going to go out there and swing away and there's not going to be a lot of discipline in the message is there all right let me ask the question then this way lonnie knowing who he is and playing do what he can what he is only comfortable doing what would you advise this version of donald trump to do um i'd advise him to keep the pressure on biden look i mean there's no drawback to keeping the pressure on in a variety of areas right you want to attack biden on his personal uh issues with uh with the hunter biden stuff you want to attack him on having a light schedule you want to attack him for being uh maybe a step slower than he was in 2012 when when i had to prepare paul ryan to debate him as vice president so you know there's no drawback if you're trump i think to keeping him on the defensive and you never know what's going to happen you might force an error you might show that biden's not really quite up to the challenge there are lots of things that could come out of this so if you're trump you keep the pressure on and see what happens let's talk about the tax return story john podesta how much would you would you use it if you were joe biden tonight look i think chris walsh will probably start there probably start with the economy and start with the tax return and i think the point that he needs to press is as president of the united states he paid 750 in taxes in 2017. you know that's what he thinks he owes the country when uh people making twenty five thousand dollars pay uh twice as much in federal income tax people make in the medium uh income bracket uh may pay ten times as much as as he he makes that he paid i would stick with that that's a very i think that's a very sticky number uh maybe even more than zero that you know that's what he thinks he owes uh the american people the frontline workers the people who are fighting wars uh overseas that's his contribution to making america great 750 dollars and i think that says a lot about his character a lot about the way he does business and you know i wouldn't i think i'd uh spend my time on that rather than you know all the shenanigans he has in the in his tax returns in the past that the new york times has exposed i agree with you about that that 750 in some way is is worse than zero 750 because of what you said it is it is a stickier number lonnie what is a good defense of this um i mean i you know i i you know again i'm putting you in the in the you know i think we know what donald trump will say oh it's not true is there a defense of this well i remember when uh mitt romney got attacked for paying a 14 uh effective tax rate right so how far the discussion has come since then yeah i think the most effective strategy might actually be the one that's native to trump i went back and watched the first debate in 2016. and there were several answers where basically the premise was uh you're wrong it's made up it's all fake and you know here are other things i'd rather talk about and there really isn't a great answer to this i mean he could say look i just took advantage of the laws that were out there there's i mean this doesn't seem like a very effective defense i think he's much better off doing what he naturally wants to do which is attack and and simply deflect and it's it's a bad news story and there's not a whole lot else you can do with something like that except for do what you're comfortable doing and not try to be somebody else john vanessa lonnie chen i think you guys did a great job previewing tonight i do think you both have given us uh some insight on what this what this 90 minutes plus is going to look like tonight thank you both up ahead north carolina can start officially processing votes today and there's already a sign of trouble we're gonna go there and to battleground michigan next but first we go back to this classic debate moment in 2000 when al gore was on a roll an eye roll [Applause] one minute man's practicing fuzzy math again there's differences [Music] so [Music] this is a situation where the state continues to struggle to expand its testing capabilities protesters feel that they need to come out in full force and support their community because they feel like they're not getting that support from the portland police another election day coming up against the backdrop of how to keep voters safe amid a pandemic the moment to truly understand who we are and who we say we are is right here at our feet you gotta get a four-year degree but a four-year degree is super expensive we have created a system where the ticket to the middle class is a thing that middle class families have to stress about and borrow for and patch together why is this happening with chris hayes subscribe now you're watching nbc news now we've got some breaking news we actually saw a large convoy of the national guard come through here it's news made for your streaming world live weekdays starting at 6 a.m eastern this morning across the country what the new normal for schools will look like many teachers left making tough choices between the job they love and their family what do i decide take care of my children or have a job that's an impossible decision you're creating a little community school this is the moment we can just develop ourselves and develop our community let's turn it over to students how do they really feel about returning to school what i miss is my teachers they are resilient [Music] a surge in coronavirus infection these developments on several fronts the story tonight the u.s shattering the record for most coveted cases in a single day from every angle what's your level of concern that the kids who have been told they're going to be home indefinitely won't be able to catch up on the ground do you have faith that this is going to bring about change soon and in depth here in portland more protests expected tonight do you think that police in this country are under attack nbc nightly news with lester holt the news business is dynamic and probably has never been more important with all that we're facing i am so proud to bring the perspective of a black woman a daughter of immigrants the wife and mother of a husband and kids who sadly are more vulnerable to police violence because of their color a proud nerd and a representative of the emerging america to cable tv news i hope the great gwen eiffel and my mom philomena carolina will look down from heaven and be proud [Music] welcome back as we head into tonight's debate both candidates will be aiming their answers towards voters in battleground states or they're supposed to be but there are new signs of trouble for president trump and the key places that he flipped in 2016 pennsylvania wisconsin in michigan two recent polls show biden leading in pennsylvania the latest nbc news mayor's poll of wisconsin shows biden now leading there by 10 points trump holds the same level of support in our michigan numbers uh he's sitting there at 44 although biden's numbers are slightly lower than that he still holds an eight point lead our own dasha burns is talking to voters in kent county michigan for our county county project but what they want to hear from the candidates tonight so grand rapids what what are you hearing dasha well chuck there are a couple things that are different on this first presidential debate night in michigan than they have been in the past the biggest change is that a lot of voters in this state actually have their ballots in hand right now they became available to voters last week and so for the last couple of days we've spent time with kent county democrat organizers and kent county republican organizers and volunteers as they have been using this time as a really critical period of time to engage with voters and do that outreach just much earlier than they would normally do it because people are going to be voting this week chuck and the approaches are pretty different one difference is the republicans trump won this county in 2016. i'll be up by a narrow margin but their chair joel freeman tells me they are trying to replicate that essentially in 2020 they're trying to hold on to that enthusiasm in 2016. they had a lot of first-time voters come out for trump and he says they're coming back again he actually told me that he doesn't see a huge difference between 2016 and 2020. democrats on the other hand are trying to make the opposite thing happen this time around and they're saying this election feels completely different from 2016. they're seeing a lot of brand new volunteers who have never been involved in politics before in terms of what people actually want to hear though from these candidates it's interesting chuck it sounds like everyone wants to see their candidate be the best version of themselves which means they want trump to be trump and biden to be biden take a listen to some of what i heard i feel like one of the biggest things that really gets his base and just like you know the common voter riled up is just how he is him and he doesn't really have too much restraint so just let trump be trump what i want to hear is is vice president biden remain away from the personal attacks which i think we know trump is going to lob remain committed to his focus on his vision on his plan on what sets him apart from another four years of president trump [Music] chuck that second voter you just heard from that's mitch monan and he is actually a republican he's voted republican in every election of his life except in 2016 when he went third party we actually met him at the kent county democrats office as he was picking up a biden harris sign to put in his yard and chuck i have to tell you i have no stats no great numbers on this but every time i've been to the kent county democrats office i have run into a republican there and mitch is actually a veteran army ranger he says he's frustrated with how trump has handled military issues and he's uh going to be interested to hear what they both have to say tonight chuck well dasha that's why we're in kent county it's why it's one of our counties and if biden is has any plans on winning this election he better hope more republicans show up to the democratic headquarters in kent county anyway dasha burns in michigan forest dasha thank you let me go south let's go to north carolina election officials are now counting mail-in ballots but data is showing that african-american voters are having their mail ballots rejected four times more frequently than white voters morgan rafford is in north carolina with more and morgan this is the first two days of early voting we saw it was immediately four percent rejection rate one percent uh among among white voters and the fact that it's still holding is pretty disturbing that's right chuck and this is kind of where they're beginning to count those mail-in ballots because as you mentioned today is the first day in north carolina north carolina is one of the few states that begins to count those mail-in ballots before the election this is the mecklenburg county board of elections so mecklenburg county for example holds charlotte here in north carolina and they're actually having a board meeting right now where they're receiving 35 000 ballots that they're going to go through tonight before they open their next batch next tuesday but this is the issue at handchuck you mentioned the fact that state statistics show that among those mail-in ballots black voters are seeing their ballots rejected or returned for inconsistencies at four times the rate of white voters and when we talk to the the state board of elections county board of elections both in monroe and union county and here in mecklenburg county they all can't give an answer as to why that discrepancy exists but they say that the inconsistencies they're seeing that's causing them to send those ballot taxes back are things like this for example this is a mail-in ballot you might not have a voter signature or you might not have the signature of a witness which is required by law in north carolina we talked to one of those voters a 70-year-old black man who said that he didn't even know that his ballot had in fact been rejected until we called him take a listen to what he had to say so you decided you were going to vote no matter what if i called if i had to crawl i would i would have gone the data showing that black voters are having their mail-in ballots rejected at four times the rate of white voters here in north carolina why do you think that is well you know it's funny how that works out you know you think after all this time it took us to get the vote you would think that we would still be able but we still seem to be fighting to vote in 2020. when we talk to non-partisan election experts they say the best explanation they can come up with right now for this discrepancy is perhaps the fact that a lot of african-american voters in north carolina are typically used to voting early and in person so many of them are voting for the first time via mail and ballot and they think that could be the mistake but the reality of it is state board of election officials they they are upset that there are these calls uh that this racial discrepancy exists but the reality of it is those numbers do exist and that impact is real for the people that we have spoken to chuck well it's important in some ways the fact that we're finding it before election day north carolina does give folks a chance to fix their ballot isn't that correct morgan that is correct that's correct so it's called a voter curing process and new york is i mean excuse me north carolina is one of the states that allows people to correct their ballots but of course they have to be notified by their county board that there was in fact a mistake and they have to be able to correct it before the election chuck and it turns out sometimes we have to do the notifying uh and it probably wasn't intended for us to be the notifiers anyway morgan radford on the ground for us in north carolina thank you morgan and i'm sure that voter thanks you now too uh our panel is back right after the break with what they'll be looking uh looking for when president trump and joe biden face off just a few minutes but first this debate moment from 2004 when john kerry took george w bush to task over his response to the war on terror in answer to your question about iraq and sending people into iraq he just said the enemy attacked us son of hussein didn't attack us osama bin laden attacked us al qaeda attacked us [Music] this is a situation where the state continues to struggle to expand its testing capabilities protesters feel that they need to come out in full force and support their community because they feel like they're not getting that support from the portland police another election day coming up against the backdrop of how to keep voters safe amid a pandemic the moment to truly understand who we are and who we say we are is right here at our feet you gotta get a four-year degree but a four-year degree is super expensive we have created a system where the ticket to the middle class is a thing that middle-class families have to stress about and borrow for and patch together why is

it for 47 years i've been doing it for three and a half years so he should be able to beat me i would think he's much more experienced he'll give him a big shot or something and he'll go you'll have out there of energy ups he'll have energy he'll be like superman for about 15 minutes i can't tell you what i'm going to do i mean i don't know i'm going to go to the debate steve's just asking will i go on the attack uh i have no idea i think this whole thing though is the big prep you know what i do is to pay prep every day i'm taking questions from you people all the time welcome back to nbc's special coverage of the 2020 presidential debates as we are now just a few minutes away from the start of the first of three scheduled showdowns that was the sound of how president trump has been gearing up for tonight here is joe biden i can hardly wait to deal with what he refers himself as a stable genius i think everybody knows this man is as a somewhat pathological tendency not to tell the truth i've begun to prepare by uh by going over what the president has said and the multiple lies he's he's told he's a fool the comments are just foolish get ready mr president here i come and i'm used to dealing with bullies the is that rather than say how i'm going to do again watch me casey han joshua johnson and michael beschloss are back to wrap things up michael i'll start with you i think we got shorted uh in the last segment there with you so take it from the joe biden and the challenger perspective here um we haven't had a challenger this far ahead against an incumbent president since bill clinton though with the ross perot thing sort of was part of it and then i guess before that you'd have to go back to jimmy carter um what what do you expect to be seeing from joe biden tonight i expect joe biden basically to treat donald trump like a child who's having a tantrum that he can't do very much about and let people choose between these two figures we're in a real crisis tonight we're in a crisis of democracy we're in a crisis of a pandemic that has taken 200 000 lives the trump people are so worried about that that it they reportedly asked the moderator chris wallace not to mention that our economy is also in very bad shape do people watching this tonight think that they have the luxury of choosing a next president who is not up to doing this job the other thing chuck is you know we will see things tonight probably that we have never seen before but historically incumbent presidents usually lose a first debate that was true of carter reagan the two bushes even obama who is known for being this great order so the odds are probably against donald trump being able to use this up to his own advantage you know casey hunt the i have to say i one of the developments that i'm most surprised about is that there is no new virus relief and we're at the first presidential debate it's not to say it might not happen before election day and i know this is your beat it's still stunning to me we are entering tonight with an unknown about whether the federal government is going to help bail a lot of people out on this virus unknown and we're just a day or so two days away from thousands of airline workers losing the help that's kept them afloat walt disney company just announced they're laying off 28 000 people because we have failed to grapple with this virus i mean the numbers are just stunning and people are really hurting and it is pretty stunning that we have let this kind of fall to the back burner and that is ultimately congress's responsibility when they have failed to keep it on the front burner i do think the talks today seem to be more advanced uh or at least trending in a direction that is more positive and i think that surprised a lot of us who you know have been reporting on this all the way along that both sides are basically still a trillion dollars apart from each other but i think that reflects the fact that you know democrats are coming under a lot of pressure to get something done here obviously president trump is running for reelection but but again the closer we get to election day the harder it is for either side to make a deal with the other i mean i think the other question here is is the economy really hurting so badly that there is absolutely no alternative i think we may be headed in that direction chuck joshua johnson this has been the part that i've just been head scratching about is how this is being left in the air and i think that this is the issue that both candidates will get punished on if they're not talking about virus relief economic relief and relief on the health care front if they're not focused on it because i think a lot of people actually are tuning in for some answers on this absolutely i think that covert 19 is the issue that you know should dominate significantly the policy parts of this debate because it crosses over into so many other things i mean the economy is listed as a separate issue from covert 19. as you just heard from casey it's all locked together i mean regarding those 28 000 disney layoffs the company says the reason it's laying those people off is because it doesn't have guidance on covet 19. one other issue i'm interested in hearing in particular is the section called race and violence in our cities and the way that that will be depicted obviously there's concern about violence that's been peripheral to black lives matter protests it's worth noting that in the early black lives matter protests about michael brown's killing in ferguson missouri you're no longer participating in protected first amendment protests so the framing of that is going to be interesting in terms of whether or not the candidates have a plan to deal with that and whether or not these two old wealthy white men are able to speak to a growingly diverse youthful nation about the future of race and equity and diversity that's one thing that i think joe biden might be able to excel at in this debate is that he projects empathy very well and if the president doubles down on being pure isle and insulting and harsh joe biden might just be well served to let that pass and then look directly in the eyes of the american people and say hey forget about all that i see you i see what's going on and here's what's happening tonight that might change the calculus for who we consider the winner of the debate but with donald trump in the white house i think the calculus for who wins and loses these days is kind of changing every day it it it does seem to and i i do think it's a good point i mean certainly that empathy uh is what joe biden has been selling to the american people michael beschloss we're we're running short on time here i want to give you the last word in terms of the sweep and history of this you mentioned we are facing an unprecedented crisis what's on the line tonight for our country not come up with a national plan to deal with it people are suffering in this economy in a way that is different from any time ever before and the other thing if i might say casey i don't know whose idea it was to put the words race and violence in the cities in the same sentence as an issue to be discussed tonight but i think that never should have been allowed because those are two subjects that should not be linked and it's almost making an editorial comment in itself no i think that's that's a fair point and certainly there was some some criticism uh of that i mean the the reality here is that race uh has been something that we as a nation have been grappling with in such you know from the very founding documents of our country so i do think that it's that it's a very good uh very good point i mean so much on the line here i was just reading through michael bech through the atlantic story today about what could be on the line here tonight in terms of how this election ultimately ends joshua johnson michael beschloss thank you both so much thanks so much for being with us this hour nbc news coverage of the first 2020 presidential debate between donald trump and joe biden continues nbc news the presidential debate here are lester holt and savannah guthrie good evening everyone welcome to the first 2020 presidential debate donald trump and joe biden face to face with election day just 35 days away and voting already underway by mail or in person in 30 states and the stage is set it's in cleveland ohio tonight the co-host case western reserve university in the cleveland clinic the moderator is fox news anchor chris wallace and the stakes well they're high the presidency and the future direction of the country on the line tonight lester there's a lot of ground to cover savannah over the next 90 minutes the candidates records including president trump's tax returns the supreme court vacancy the pandemic the economy racism and civil unrest and the integrity of the election itself we may need a little longer than an hour and a half but the debate commission has set the rules has determined by the way that the moderator is not responsible for fact checking the candidates tonight but our team is standing by to do just that and to offer expert insight and analysis and for live fact checking during the debate you can go to nbcnews.com so let's get started we'll go first to chief white house correspondent hallie jackson who is inside the debate hall hallie what are you hearing from both camps a couple of things about you have two very different candidates and two very different kinds of debate prep that has been happening sources close to president trump for example say he's really been doing more informal q and a's with his top advisors on the biden side people familiar with his planning say the focus this week has gotten more intense as he has done issue by issue practice sessions essentially when you talk about topics watch for president trump to try to turn this race into less of a referendum and more of a choice he will likely go on attack probably according to aides who have been previewing this by getting personal with joe biden potentially going after his son hunter biden on the other side joe biden will focus on the pandemic he wants to keep the focus on that and you won't see a lot of live fact checking from him unless something is particularly egregious savannah all right also with this is nbc news political director and moderator of meet the press chuck todd chuck what will you be watching for this evening well i'll tell you it's an unusual situation when the front runner is the challenger and the person that has to up in the race is actually the incumbent and that's donald trump here i'm curious to see does president trump he's been telegraphing that he's going to get personal and and basically do whatever it takes to shake up joe biden but does he actually tell voters what he wants to do for a second term it's something he hasn't done for joe biden his it's obvious does is he able to parry away by uh trump's attacks without chasing him down rabbit holes we're about 30 seconds away senior washington correspondent andrea mitchell is there the moderator is in place this race has been remarkably stable but a debate always has the opportunity to upend things andrea absolutely and donald trump goes into this debate uh farther behind in national polls than any incumbent since george herbert walker bush in 92 against bill clinton but that was a three-way race with ross perot still he's got a lot to prove but i would not bet on any conventional wisdom tonight he is a performer and of course we have to see how he performs tonight all right andrea thanks and with the debate about to begin we want to go to cleveland and moderator chris wallace good evening from the health education campus of case western reserve university and the cleveland clinic i'm chris wallace of fox news and i welcome you to the first of the 2020 presidential debates between president donald j trump and former vice president joe biden this debate is sponsored by the commission on presidential debates the commission has designed the format six roughly 15 minute segments with two-minute answers from each candidate to the first question then open discussion for the rest of each segment both campaigns have agreed to these rules for the record i decided the topics and the questions in each topic i can assure you none of the questions has been shared with the commission or the two candidates this debate is being conducted under health and safety protocols designed by the cleveland clinic which is serving as the health security advisor to the commission for all four debates as a precaution both campaigns have agreed the candidates will not shake hands at the beginning of tonight's debate the audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent no cheers no boos or other interruptions so we and more importantly you can focus on what the candidates have to say no noise except right now as we welcome the republican nominee president trump and the democratic nominee vice president biden hello gentlemen a lot of people have been waiting for this night so let's get going our first subject is the supreme court president trump you nominated amy coney barrett over the weekend to succeed the late ruth bader ginsburg on the court you say the constitution is clear about your obligation and the senate to consider a nominee to the court vice president biden you say that this is an effort by the president and republicans to jam through an appointment and what you call an abuse of power my first question to both of you tonight why are you right in the argument you make and your opponent wrong and where do you think a justice barrett would take the court president trump in this first segment you go first two minutes thank you very much chris i will tell you very simply we won the election elections have consequences we have the senate we have the white house and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all top top academic good in every way good in every way in fact some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from notre dame and other places so i think she's going to be fantastic we have plenty of time even if we did it after the election itself i have a lot of time after the election as you know so i think that she will be outstanding she's going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court we really feel that we have a professor at notre dame highly respected by all said she's the single greatest student he's ever had he's been a professor for a long time at a great school and we just we won the election and therefore we have the right to choose her and very few people knowingly would say otherwise and by the way the democrats they wouldn't even think about not doing it if they had the only difference is they'd try and do it faster there's no way they would give it up they had merit garland but the problem is they didn't have the election so they were stopped and probably that would happen in reverse also definitely would happen in reverse so we won the election and we have the right to do it chris president trump thank you um same question to you vice president biden you have two minutes well first of all um thank you for doing this and looking forward to this mr president i uh the american people have a right to have a say in who the supreme court nominee is and that say occurs when they vote for a united states senators and when they vote for the president united states they're not going to get that chance now because we're in the middle of an election already election has already started tens of thousands of people have already voted and so the thing that should happen is we should wait we should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because that's the only way the american people get to express their view is by who they elect as president and who they elect as vice president now what's at stake here is the president's made it clear he wants to get rid of the affordable care act he's been running on that he ran on that and he hasn't been governing on that he's in the supreme court right now trying to get rid of the the affordable care act which will strip 20 million people from having insurance health insurance now if if they if it goes into court and and the justice and i have nothing i'm not opposed to the justices she seems like a very fine person but she's written before she went in the bench which is her right that she thinks that the affordable care act is not constitutional the other thing is on the court and if it's struck down what happens women's rights are fundamentally changed once again a woman could be held pay more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy we were able to they were able to charge a woman more for the same exact procedure amanda gets and that ended when we in fact passed the affordable care act and there's a hundred million people have pre-existing conditions and they'll be taken away as well those pre-existing conditions the insurance companies are going to love this and so it's just not appropriate to do this before this election if he wins the election and the senate is democrat a republican then he goes forward if not we should wait until february there aren't a hundred million people with pre-existing conditions as far as the say is concerned the people already had their say they okay justice ginsburg said very powerfully very strongly at some point ten years ago or so she said a president and the senate is elected for a period of time but a president is elected for four years we're not elected for three years i'm not elected for three years so we have the senate we have a president elected to the next during that period of time during that period of time we have an opening i'm not elected for three years i'm elected for four years and 100 million people jill the hundred million people is totally wrong i don't know where you got that number the bigger problem that you have is that you're going to extinguish 180 million people with their private health care that they're very simply not true well you said no you're going to socialist now you're going to socialism and gentlemen we're now into open discussion discussion discussion yes i agree go ahead vice president number one uh he he knows that uh what i proposed what i proposed is that uh we expand obamacare and we increase it we do not wipe any and one of the big debates we had with 23 of my colleagues trying to win the nomination that i won were saying that biden wanted to allow people to have private insurance still they can they do they will under my proposal not what you've said and it's not what the party is saying that is simply the party doesn't say your party wants to go socialist party is socialistic i am and they're gonna dominate you joe you know that i am the democratic party right now the platform of the democratic party is what i in fact approved of what i approved of now here's the deal the deal is that it's going to wipe out pre-existing conditions and by the way the 20 200 million the 200 000 people that have died on his watch there how many of those and have survived well there's seven million people that contracted covet what does it mean for them going forward if you strike down the affordable care act joe you've had 308 000 military people dying because you couldn't provide them proper health care in the military so don't tell me i'm happy to talk about that and if you were here you wouldn't be 200 it would be 2 million people because you were very late on the draw you didn't want me to ban china which was heavily infected you didn't want me to ban all right gentlemen which was heavily president you would have been much later mr president you're talking about two million people you're not president we are going to talk about covet in the next segment but go ahead let me finish the point is that the president also is opposed to roe v wade that's on the ballot as well and the court in the court and so that's also at stake right now and so the election is all you don't know what's on the ballot why is it in the ballot what because it's not on the ballot it's on the ballot in the court i think so in the court well there's nothing happening there donald would you i don't know her view on roe v wade i don't know well all right let's all right let's talk we've got a lot to unpack here gentlemen we got a lot of time so uh on health care and then we'll come back to roe v wade all right mr president the supreme court will hear a case a week after the election in which the trump administration along with 18 state attorneys general are seeking to overturn that's right obamacare to end obamacare you have spent the last year because they want to give a good help if i may ask my question sir good health care over uh the last four years you have promised to repeal and replace obamacare but you have never in these four years come up with a plan a comprehensive plan to replace obamacare of course i have well i'll get rid of the individual i'm going to give you excuses i got rid of the individual mandate which was a big chunk that is absolutely a big thing that was the worst part of obamacare chris that was the worst part of it let me ask my question well i'll ask joe i i individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of obamacare i got rid of it we will protect and i would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer it you in the course of these four years have never come up with a comprehensive plan to replace obamacare and just this last thursday you signed a largely symbolic executive order to protect people with pre-existing conditions five days before this debate so my question sir is what is the trump health care plan well first of all i guess i'm debating you not him but that's okay i'm not surprised let me just tell you something that there's nothing symbolic i'm cutting drug prices i'm going with favored nations which no president has the courage to do because you're going against big pharma drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90 percent you could have done it during your 47-year period in government but you didn't do it nobody's done it so we're cutting health care all of the things that we've done i'll give you an example insulin it's going to it was destroying families destroying people the cost i'm getting it for so cheap it's like water you want to know the truth so cheap take a look at all of the drugs that what we're doing prescription drug prices we're going to allow our governors now to go to other countries to buy drugs because they pay just a tiny fraction this is an open discussion sir you'll be happy i'm about to pick up on one of your points to ask the vice president which is he points out that you would like to add a public option to obamacare and the argument that he makes and other republicans make is that that is going to end private insurance it will end private insurance and create a government takeover of healthcare it does not it's only for those people who are so poor they qualify for medicaid they can get that free in most states except governors who want to deny people or poor medicaid anyone who qualifies for medicare would mean medicaid would automatically be enrolled in the public option the vast majority of the american people would still not be in that option number one so you agree with bernie sanders far left on the manifesto that's because you socialize medicine look listen to him the fact of the matter is i beat bernie sanders not very much i beat him a whole hell of a lot i'm here i'm here standing facing you would have left two days early you would have lost every prize oh he knows how to support tuesday you gotta look very little there's i got very lucky and very lucky tonight as well and tonight i'm going to make sure because here's the deal here's the deal the fact is that everything he's saying so far is simply a lie i'm not here to call out his lies everybody knows he's a liar but you i just want him to tell you that i i i i want to make sure you ordered less in your class tonight first oh god i want to make sure you're president can you let him finish sir no he doesn't know how to do that he has he's you picked it you just lost the left you agreed with bernie sanders on a plan absolutely yeah socialized medicine mr president tell you what he is not for any help for people needing health care because his because he in fact already has cost 10 million people their health care that they had from their employers because of his recession number one number two there are 20 million people getting health care through obamacare now that he wants to take it away he won't ever look in eye and say that's what he wants to do take it away oh i want to give numbers better health care at a much lower price go ahead sir obamacare is no good we made it better and i had a choice to make very early on we took away the individual mandate we guarantee pre-existing conditions but took away the individual mandate listen this is the way it is and that destroyed that they shouldn't even call it obamacare then i had a choice to make do i let my people run it really well or badly if i run it badly they'll probably blame him but they'll blame me but more importantly i want to help people okay i said you got to run it so well that's it and i just had a meeting with them they said the problem is no matter how well you run obamacare it's a disaster it's too expensive premiums are too high that it doesn't work we do want to get rid of it i have to give you roughly equal time please let the vice president talk he has no plan for health care yes we do please he sends out wishful thinking he has executive orders that have no power he hasn't lowered drug costs for anybody he's been promising a health care plan since he got elected he has none like almost everything else he talks about he does not have a plan he doesn't have a plan and the fact is this man doesn't know what he's talking about all right i have one final question for you sure uh mr vice president if senate republicans we were talking originally about the supreme court here if senate republicans go ahead and confirm justice barrett there has been talk about ending the filibuster or even packing the court adding to the nine justices there you call this a distraction by the president but in fact it wasn't brought up by the president it was brought up by some of your democratic colleagues in i'm saying the congress so my question to you is you have refused in the past to talk about it are you willing to tell the american people tonight whether or not you will support either ending the filibuster or packing the court whatever position i take in that that'll become the issue the issue is the american people should speak you should go out and vote you're in voting now vote and let your senators know how strong you feel let vote now make sure you in fact let people know he doesn't we're a senator i'm not going to answer the question because you answered that because the question is the question is radical left well you should listen who is on your list joe this is on youtube gentlemen i think this is so unpleasant we're not going to give a little we have ended this segment we're going to move on to the second segment that was really a productive segment wasn't it keep yapping man the people understand yeah 47 years you've done nothing they understand all right the second subject is covid19 which is an awfully serious subject so let's try to be serious about it we have had more than seven million cases of coronavirus in the united states and more than two hundred thousand people have died even after we produce a vaccine experts say that it could be months or even years before we come back to anything approaching normal my question for both of you is based on what you have said and done so far and what you have said you would do starting in 2021 why should the american people trust you more than your opponent to deal with this public health crisis going forward in this case the question goes to you first sir two minutes uninterrupted good luck two hundred thousand dead as you said over seven million infected in the united states we in fact have five percent or four percent of the world's population twenty percent of the deaths forty thousand people a day are contracting covet in addition to that about between seven fifty and a thousand people today are dying when he was presented with that number he said it is what it is well it is what it is because you are who you are that's why it is the president has no plan he hasn't laid out anything he knew all the way back in february how serious this crisis was he knew it was a deadly disease what did he do he's on tape is acknowledging he knew it he said he didn't tell us or give people a warning of it because he didn't want to panic the american people you don't panic he panicked in addition to that what did he do he went in and he we were insisting that the chinese the people we had on the ground in china should be able to go to wuhan and determine for themselves how dangerous this was he did not even ask she to do that he told us what a great job she was doing he said we owe him a debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us and what did he do then he then did nothing he waited and waited and waited he still doesn't have a plan i laid out back in march exactly what we should be doing and i laid out again in july what we should be doing we should be providing all the protective gear posts we should be providing the money the house has passed in order to be able to go out and get people the help they need to keep their businesses open open schools that cost a lot of money you should get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap and get in in your golf course and go in the oval office and bring together the democrats republicans and fund what needs to be done now to save lives so if we would have listened to you up two minutes sir if we would have listened to you the country would have been left wide open millions of people would have died not 200 000 and one person is too much it's china's fault it should have never happened they stopped it from going in but it was china's fault and by the way when you talk about numbers you don't know how many people died in china you don't know how many people died in russia you don't know how many people died in india they don't exactly give you a straight count just so you understand but if you look at what we've done i closed it and you said he's xenophobic he's a racist and he's xenophobic because you didn't think i should have closed our country wait a minute it says two minutes you didn't think we should have closed our country because you thought it was too it was terrible you wouldn't have closed it for another two months by my doing it early in fact dr fauci said president trump saved thousands of lives many of you a democrat governor said president trump did a phenomenal job we worked with the governor oh really go take a look the governor said i did a phenomenal job most of them said that in fact people that would not be necessarily on my side said that president trump did a phenomenal job we did we got the gowns we got the masks we made the ventilators you wouldn't have made ventilators and now we're weeks away from a vaccine we're doing therapeutics already fewer people are dying when they get sick far fewer people are dying we've done a great job the only thing i haven't done a good job and that's because of the fake news no matter what you say to them they give you a bad press on it's just fake news they give you good press they give me bad press because that's the way it is unfortunately but let me just tell you something i don't care i've gotten used to it but i'll tell you joe you could never have done the job that we did you don't have it in your blood you could have never done that yet i know how to do the job i know how to get the job well you didn't do very well in swine flu h1n1 you were a disaster your own children were in disaster 14 000 people died not two hundred thousand there was no economic recession sure you made up there was nowhere you made a point and there was no one there's no we didn't shut down the economy this is his economy that's being he shut down the reason it's shut down is because look you folks at home how many of you get up this morning and had an empty chair at the kitchen table because someone died of covet how many of you were in a situation where you lost your mom or dad and you couldn't even speak to them a nurse holding a phone up so you could in fact say goodbye would have lost father how many people far more people than you would have been and by the way his own cdc director says we could lose as many as another 200 000 people between now and the end of the year and he held him he said if we just wear a mask we can save half those numbers just just a mask and by the way in terms of the the whole notion of a vaccine we're for a vaccine but we i don't trust him at all nor do you i know you don't well we trust as a scientist johnson by the way let me let me move on to questions about the future because you both have touched on one of the two of the questions i'm going to ask uh focusing on the future first president trump you have repeatedly either contradicted or been at odds with some of your government's own top scientists the week before last the head of the centers for disease control dr redfield said it would be summer before the vaccine would become generally available to the public you said that he was confused and mistaken those are your two words but dr slowy the head of your operation worf speed has said exactly the same thing are they both wrong well i've spoken to the companies and we can have it a lot sooner it's a very political thing because people like this would rather make it political than save lives it is a very political thing i've spoken to pfizer i've spoken to all of the people that you have to speak to we have great modern johnson and johnson and others they can go faster than that by a lot become very political because the left or i don't know i don't know what's the head of your operation warp speed doctor i disagree with him yeah no i disagree with both of them and he didn't say that he said it could be there but it could also be much i had him in my office two days he talked about the summer sir before it's generally available she said it's a possibility that we'll have the answer before november first it could also be everything that's generally available well we're going to deliver it right away we have the military all set up logistically they're all set up we have our military that delivers soldiers and they can do two hundred thousand a day they're going to be this is the same man it's all set up by easter this would be gone away by the warm weather it'd be gone miraculous like a miracle and by the way maybe you could inject some bleach in your arm and that would take care of it this is the same thing said sarcastic of course you know that i would have said sarcasm so here's the deal this man is talking about a vaccine every serious every serious company is talking about maybe having a vaccine done by the end of the year but the distribution of that vaccine will not occur until sometime beginning or the middle of next year to get it out if we get the vaccine and pray god we will may god mr vice president i want to pick up the vaccine i want to pick up on this question though you say the public can trust the scientists but they can't trust president trump in fact you said that again tonight your running mate senator harris goes further saying the public health experts quote will be muzzled will be suppressed given the fact that polls already show that people are concerned about the vaccine and are reluctant to take it are you and your running mate senator harris contributing to that fear no more than the question you just asked him you pointed out he puts pressure and disagrees with his own scientist but you're saying you can't hear the senator harris is saying he can't trust the son well no no you can't trust the scientist he does she didn't say that you can't she said the public health experts quote will be muzzled will be suppressed well that's what he's going to try to do but there's millions of scientists there's thousands of scientists out there like here at this great hospital that don't work for him their job doesn't depend on him that's not they're the people there and by the way to the scientists that are in charge by the way they will have the vaccine very soon do you believe for a moment what he's telling you in light of all the lies he's told you about the whole issue relating to covet he still hasn't even acknowledged that he knew this was happening knew how dangerous was going to be back in february and he didn't even tell you he's on record as saying it he panicked or he just looked at the stock market one of the two because guess what a lot of people died and a lot more going to die unless he gets a lot smarter a lot quicker mr president did you use the word smart uh so you said you went to delaware state but you forgot the name of your college you didn't go to delaware state you graduated either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class don't ever use the word smart with me don't ever use that word oh give me your because you know what there's nothing smart about you joe 47 years you've done this let's say this to ben you would have had let me just tell you something jeff if you would have had the charge of what i was put through i had to close the greatest economy in the history of our country and by the way now it's being built again you see he's going to get into the economy in the next segment sir okay it's going up fast okay when it comes to how the virus has been handled so far the two of you have taken very different approaches and this is going to affect how the virus is handled going forward by whichever of you ends up becoming the next president i want to quickly go through several of those reopenings vice president biden you have been much more reluctant than president trump about reopening the economy and schools why sir because he doesn't have a plan if i were running i know how what the plan is you've got to provide these businesses the ability to have the money to be able to reopen with the ppe as well as with the sanitation they need you have to provide them pelosi well he's just shush for a minute tell it nancy pelosi and schumer they have a plan he won't even meet with him the republicans won't meet with the senate but he he sits he sits on his golf course and i mean literally think about it you probably play more than i do jim what about this question of reopenings and the fact that he wants to shut down this country and i want to keep it open and we did it wait a minute let me shut you down for a second joe just for one second we want to he wants to shut down the country we just went through it we had to because we didn't know anything about the disease now we found that elderly people with heart problems and diabetes and different problems are very very vulnerable we learned a lot young children aren't even younger people aren't we've learned a lot but he wants to shut it down more people will be heard by continuing if you look at pennsylvania if you look at certain states that have been shut down they have democrat governors all one of the reasons they're shut down is because they want to keep it shut down until after the election those states are not you have begun to increasingly question the effectiveness of masks as a disease preventer and in fact recently you have cited the issue of of waiters touching their mouths and touching plates are you questioning no i think they'll be asking okay you have to understand if you look i mean i have a mask right here i put a mask on it you know when i think i need it tonight as an example everybody's had a test and you've had social distancing and all of the things that you have to but i wear masks when needed when needed i wear a mask okay let me ask i don't have to i don't wear mess like him every time you see him he's got a mask he could be speaking 200 feet away from it he shows up with the biggest mask i've ever seen i will say i would say vice president biden go ahead sir look the way to open businesses is give them the wherewithal to be able to open we provided money the congress i was asking a sir about masks well mask must make a big difference his own head of the cdc said if we just wore mass between now if everybody wore masks in social distance between now and january we'd probably save up to a hundred thousand lives it matters and they've also said the opposite they've also said no no serious person said the opposite no seriously dr fauci said that he did it very strongly a minute left and then assessments are not good then he changed his mind he said that's good i'm okay with masks i want to ask you both about one last subject because your different approaches has even affected the way that you have campaigned president trump you're holding large rallies with crowds packed together thousands of people i would say outside yes sir agreed uh vice president biden you are holding much smaller uh events with nobody will show up people with math what's wrong with you nobody shows up to his rights all right in any case why are you holding the big rallies why you not you goes first sir because people want to hear what i have to say i mean what are you doing great job and i'll have 25 35 000 people show up at airports we use airports well so far we have had no problem whatsoever it's outside that's a big difference according to the experts and we do them outside we have tremendous crowds as you see i mean every and and literally on 24 hours notice and joe does the circles and has three people someplace okay by the way one of the last big rallies he has and a reporter came up to him to ask him a question he said no no no stand back put on your mask put on a mask have you been tested i'm way i'm way far away from those other people that's what he said i can't i'm gonna be okay he's not worried about you he's not worried about the people out there breathing in one of them we've had no negativity no negative effect we've had no negative effect and we've had thirty five forty thousand people we wanna lead the israelis just quickly finish up because i wanna move on to our next yes i would he's been totally irresponsible the way in which he has handled the social distancing and people wearing masks basically encourage them not to all right he's a fool if you could get the crowds you would have done the same thing but you can't nobody can gentlemen can we move on to the accusers gentlemen can we move on to the economy yes the economy is i think it's fair to say recovering faster than expected from the shutdown much faster in the second quarter the unemployment rate fell to 8.4 last month the federal reserve says the hit to growth which is going to be there is not going to be nearly as big as they had expected president trump you say we are in a v-shaped recovery vice president biden you say it's more of a k-shape what difference does that mean to the american people in terms of the economy president trump in this segment you go first so we built the greatest economy in history we closed it down because of the china plague when the plague came in we closed it down which was very hard psychologically to do he didn't think we should close it down and he was wrong and again two million people would be dead now instead of still 204 thousand people is too much one person is too much should have never happened from china but what happened is we closed it down and now we're reopening and we're doing record business we had 10.4 million people in a four-month period that we've put back into the workforce that's a record the likes of which nobody's ever seen before and he wants to close down the he will shut it down again he will destroy this country you know a lot of people between drugs and alcohol and depression when you start shutting it down you take a look at what's happening at some of your democrat-run states where they have these tough shutdowns and i'm telling you it's because they don't want to open it one of them came out last week you saw that oh we're going to open up on november 9th why november 9th because it's after the election they think they're hurting us by keeping them closed they're hurting people people know what to do they can social distance they can wash their hands they can wear masks they can do whatever they want but they got to open these states up when you look at north carolina when you look and these governors are under siege pennsylvania michigan and a couple of others you've got to open these states up it's not fair you're talking about almost it's like being in prison and you look at what's going on with divorce look at what's going on with alcoholism and drugs it's a very very sad thing and he'll close down the whole country this guy will close down the whole country and destroy our country our country is coming back incredibly well setting records as it does it we don't need somebody to come in and say let's shut it down all right you're two minutes sir we're now moved to you as i as i said posing the question the president says it's a v-shape recovery you say it's a k-shaped recovery what's the difference the difference is millionaires and billionaires like him in the middle of the culver crisis had done very well another billionaires of ray have made another 300 billion dollars because of his profligate tax proposal and he only focused on the market but you folks at home you folks living in scranton and claymont and all the small towns and working-class towns in america how old are you doing this guy paid well total of 750 in taxes wait no sir i understand you've agreed to the two minutes so please let him have it i get my time back the fact is that he has in fact worked on this in a way that he's going to be the first president united states to leave office having fewer jobs in his administration than when he became president fewer jobs than when he became friends first one in american history secondly the people who have lost their jobs are those people who have been on the front lines those people who have been saving our lives those people who have been out there dying people who've been putting themselves in the way to make sure that we could all try to make it and the idea that he is insisting that we go forward and open when you have almost half the states in america with a significant increase in covert deaths and covert cases in the united states of america and he wants to open it up more why does he want to open it up why doesn't he take care of the america you can't fix the economy until you fix the covet crisis and he has no intention of doing anything about making it better for you all at home in terms of your health and your safety schools why are schools open because it cost a lot of money to open them safely you know they were going to give his administration going to give the teachers and school students masks and then they decided no couldn't do that because it's not a national emergency not a national emergency they've done nothing to help small businesses nothing they're closing one in six is now gone he ought to get on the job and take care of the needs of the american people so we can't open safe right your time is up sir we are going to get to the i have to respond to that well you both had two minutes sir excuse me he made a statement people want their schools no people want their schools open they don't want to be shut down they don't want their state shut down they want their restaurants i look at new york it's so sad what's happening in new york it's almost like a ghost town and i'm not sure it can ever recover what they've done in new york people want their places open they want to get back to their lives people they'll be careful safe but they want their schools i'm the one that brought back football by the way i brought back big ten football it was me and i'm very happy to do it and all right people of ohio are very proud of me and you're not gonna get about that gentlemen we're gonna get to your economic plans going forward in a moment but first mr president as you well know there's a new report that in 2016 the year you were elected president and 2017 your first year as president that you paid 750 a year in federal income tax each of those years i know that you pay a lot of other taxes but i'm asking you the specific question is it true that you paid 750 in federal income taxes each of those two years i paid millions of dollars in taxes millions of dollars of income tax and let me just tell you there was a story in one of the papers that was your tax i paid 38 million one year i paid 27 million show us your tax returns i went uh you'll see it as soon as it's finished you'll see it you know if you want to do go to the board of elections there's a 118 page or so report that says everything i have every bank i have i'm totally under leveraged because the assets are extremely good and we have a very we have a i built it i'm asking you a specific question which is let me tell you i understand all of that no mr president i'm asking you a question will you tell us how much you paid in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017. millions of dollars you paid millions of dollars millions of dollars millions of dollars and you'll get to see it and you'll get to see it but let me just tell you chris let me just tell you something that it was the tax laws i don't want to pay tax be before i came here i was a private developer i was a private business people like every other private person unless they're stupid they go through the laws and that's what it is he passed a tax bill that gave us all these privileges for depreciation and for tax credits we build a building and we get tax credits like the hotel on pennsylvania avenue you get a massive which by the way was given to me by the obama administration if you can believe that now the men got fired right after that happened but why is president you want to respond yeah i do want to respond look the tax code that made him put him in a position that he pays less tax than a school teacher makes on the money a school teacher makes is because of him take he says he's smart because he can take advantage of the tax code and he does take advantage of the tax code that's why i'm going to eliminate the trump tax cuts and we're going to we're going to eliminate those taxes and make sure that we invest in the people who in fact need the help people out there need help but why didn't you do it over 20 in the last 25 years because you weren't doing it because you weren't president screwing things up you were a senator and you're the worst president that america has ever had let me let me just tell you joe i've done more in in 47 months i've done more than you've done in 47 years joe we've done things that you never even thought about okay including fixing the broken military that you gave me taking care of you mr president we're talking about the economy i'd like to ask you about your plans going forward because mr vice president your economic plan if you were to be elected president uh focuses a lot on big government big taxes big spending i want to focus first on the taxes you proposed more than four trillion dollars over a decade and new taxes on individuals making more than four hundred thousand dollars a year and on corporations president trump says that that kind of an increase in taxes is going to hurt the economy as it's just coming out of a recession well just take a look at what as the the analysis has been on by wall street firms points out that my my economic plan would create seven million more jobs in his in four years number one and number two it would create an additional one trillion dollars in economic growth because it would be about buying american that we have to we're going to make this federal government spend 600 billion a year on everything from ships to steel to buildings and the like and under my proposal we're going to make sure that every penny of that has to be made by a company respectfully so i'm talking about taxes not spending well by the way i'm going to eliminate a significant number of the tax i'm going to make the the corporate tax 28 it shouldn't be 21 you have 19 companies 91 companies federal i mean in the fortune 500 who don't pay a single penny in tax making billions of dollars why didn't you do it billions of dollars because obama because you in fact passed that that was your tax report you got it done and you know what happened you got it down our economy boom it's never boom the economy president let me mr president let me pick up on that you would continue your free market approach lower taxes more deregulation correct not lower taxes american people excuse me but in but in obama's you talk about the economy booming it turns out that in obama's final three years as president more jobs were created a million and a half more jobs than in the first three years of your presidency they had the slowest recovery since night economic recovery since 1929 it was the slowest recovery also they took over something that was down here all you had to do was turn on the lights and you pick up a lot but they had the slowest economic recovery since 1929 let me tell you about the stock market when the stock market goes up that means jobs it also means 401ks if you got in if you ever became president with your ideas you want to terminate my tax my taxes i i'll tell you what you'll lose half of the companies that have poured in here will leave and plenty of companies that are already here they'll leave for other places have they will leave and you will have a depression the likes of which you've never seen look we inherited the worst recession short of a depression in american history i was asked to bring it back we were able to have an economic recovery that created the jobs you're talking about we handed him a booming economy he blew it it wasn't he he wasn't booming it was the weakness is it fair to say he blew it when in fact when there was record on low unemployment yeah before covet yeah but because what he did even before covert manufacturing went in the hole manufacturing went whole excuse me number two number three they said it would take no you're number two no chris chris they said it would take a miracle to bring back manufacturing i brought back seven hundred thousand jobs they brought back nothing they gave up on manufacturing standard fare i'm the guy he totally gave up i was asked to bring back chrysler and general motors who brought him back right here in the state of ohio and michigan he blew it they're gone he blew it and in fact they're gone ohio had the best year it's ever had last year michigan had the best year they've ever had it's not many car companies came in from germany from japan went to michigan and went to ohio they're not happy and they didn't come in mr vice president and so you take a look at what he's actually done he's done very little his trade deals are the same way he talks about these great trade deals you know he talks about the art of the deal china has made perfected the art of the steel we have a higher deficit with china now than we did before we have the highest deficit trade deficit china with mexico all right china ate your lunch joe and no wonder your son goes in and he takes out he takes out billions of dollars takes out billions of dollars to manage he makes millions of dollars and also while we're at it why is it just out of curiosity the mayor of moscow's wife gave your son three and a half million dollars what did he do to deserve it what did he do with baristas totally discredited totally discredited and by the way well wait he didn't get three and a half million dollars joe the vice president he got through the president that is not true really mr president it's an open discussion please it's a fact well there's no people who have raised an issue let this be vice president discredited my son did nothing wrong i think he did mr president he doesn't want to let me answer because he knows i have the truth his position has been totally thoroughly discriminated by everybody well by the media by our allies by the world bank by everyone has discredited a matter of fact testified under oath in his administration said i did my job and i did it very well who they are ever well i'll give you the list of the people who tested it they've you've already fired most of them because they did a good job some people don't know but here's it with you wait a minute you get the final word well it's hard to get any word in with this clown excuse me this hey let me just say no no i'm mr president that is simply why did he deserve three and a half million from moscow look here's the deal we want to talk about families and ethics i don't want to do that i mean his family we could talk about all night his families are my family my family what's the fortune coming down and helping us with government mr that's not true it doesn't want to talk about what you need you the american people it's about you that's what we're talking about all right that's the end of the segment we're moving we're moving on it didn't take them vice president can i be honest it's a very important try to be honest the answer to the question is no why shouldn't i be different than the two of you so here's the good point we have six segments we have ended that segment we're going to go to the next segment in that segment you each are going to have two uninterrupted moments in those two interrupted minutes mr president you can say anything you want i'm going to ask a question about race but if you want to answer about something else go ahead but we i think that the country would be better served if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions i'm appealing to you sir to do that well and him too well frankly you've been doing more interruptions that's all right but he does plenty well less than sir no less than you have let's please continue on the issue of race vice president biden you say that president trump's response to the violence in charlottesville three years ago when he talked about very fine people on both sides was what directly led you to launch this run for president oh yes sure president trump you have often said that you believe you have done more for black americans than any president with the possible exception of abraham lincoln my question for the two of you is why should voters trust you rather than your opponent to deal with the race issues facing this country over the next four years vice president biden you go first it's about equity inequality it's about decency it's about the constitution and we have never walked away from trying to quite require equity for everyone equality for the whole of america but we've never accomplished it but we've never walked away from it like he has done it is true the reason i got in the race is with those people close your eyes remember what those people look like coming out of the fields carrying torches their veins bulging speeding and just spewing anti-semitic bile and accompanied by the ku klux klan a young woman got killed and they asked the president what he thought he said there were very fine people on both sides no president has ever said anything like that it is now second sir second point i'd make to you is that when floyd was killed when mr floyd was killed there was a peaceful protest in front of the white house what did he do he came out of his bunker had the military to use tear gas on him so he could walk across to a church and hold up a bible and then what happened after that the bishop of that very church said that it was the disgrace the general who was with him said he only all he ever wants to do is divide people not unite people at all this is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle to try to generate racist hatred racist division this is a man who in fact you talk about helping african americans one in 1 000 african americans has been killed because of the cona the coronavirus and if he doesn't do something quickly by the end of the year one in 500 will have been killed one in 500 african americans this man this man is the is a savior of african americans this man cares at all this man's done virtually nothing look the fact is that you have to look at what he talks about you have to look at what he did and what he did has been disastrous for the african-american community so president trump you have two minutes why should americans trust you over your opponent to deal with racism did a crime bill 1994 where you called them super predators african americans the super predators and they've never forgotten it they've never forgotten it jeff no sir it's his two minutes so you did that and they called you a super predator and i'm letting people out of jail now that you have treated the african-american population community you have treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country you did the 199 and that's why if you look at the polls i'm doing better than any republican has done in a long time because they saw what you did you call them super predators and you've called them worse than that because you look back at your testimony over the years you've called them a lot worse than that as far as the church is concerned and as far as the generals are concerned we just got the support of 200 mil 250 military leaders and generals total support law enforcement almost every law enforcement group in the united states i have florida i have texas i have ohio i have every excuse me portland the sheriff just came out today and he said i support president trump i don't think you have any law enforcement you can't even say the word law enforcement because if you say those words you're going to lose all of your radical left supporters and why aren't you saying those words joe why don't you say the words law enforcement because you know what if they called us in portland we would put out that fire in a half an hour but they won't do it because they're run by radical left democrats if you look at chicago if you look at any place you want to look seattle they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back seattle minneapolis we got it back joe because we believe in law and order but you don't the top 10 cities in just about the top 40 cities are run by democrats in many cases radical left and they've got you wrapped around their finger joe to a point where you don't want to say anything about law and order and i'll tell you what the people of this country want and demand law and order and you're afraid to even say it all right i want to i want to return to the question of race vice president biden after the grand jury in the brianna taylor case decided not to charge any of the police with homicide you said it raises the question quote whether justice could be equally applied in america do you believe that there is a separate but unequal system of justice for blacks in this country yes there is there's just systemic injustice in this country in education and work and in in law enforcement and and the way in which it's enforced but look the vast majority of police officers are good decent honorable men and women they risk their lives every day to take care of us but there are some bad apples and when they occur when they find them they have to be sorted out they have to be held accountable they have to be held accountable and what i'm going to do as president united states is call a a together an entire group of people at the white house blow everything from the civil rights groups to the police officers the police chiefs and we're going to work this out we're going to work this out so we change the way in which we have more transparency in when these things happen these cops aren't happy to see what happened to to george floyd these cops aren't happy to see what happened to brianna taylor most don't like it but we have to have a system where people are held accountable when and by the way violence and response is never appropriate never appropriate peaceful protest is violence is never appropriate right what is peace protest when they run through the i promise we're going to get to the issue of law and order in a moment this month your administration uh directed federal agencies to end racial sensitivity training that addresses white privilege or critical race theory why did you decide to do that to end racial sensitivity training and do you believe that there is systemic racism in this country sir i ended it because it's racist i ended it because a lot of people were complaining that they were asked to do things that were absolutely insane that it was a radical revolution that was taking place in our military uh in our schools all over the place and you know it and so does everybody else totally racial sensitivity training if you were a certain person you had no status in life it was sort of a reversal and if you look at the people we were paying people hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly very sick ideas and and really they were teaching people to hate our country and i'm not going to do that i'm not going to allow that to happen we have to go back to the core values of this country they were teaching people that our country is a horrible place it's a racist place and they were teaching people to hate our country and i'm not going to allow that to happen vice president biden nobody's doing that he's just he's the racist you just don't here's the deal i know a lot more about it the fact is that there is racial insensitivity people have to be made aware of what other people feel like what what insults them what is demeaning to them it's important to people know they don't want to many people don't want to hurt other people's feelings but it's amazing it makes a big difference it makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a self a sense of self-esteem it's a little bit like how this guy and his friends look down on so many people they look down their nose on people like irish catholics like me and grow up in scranton they look down on people who don't have money they look down on people who are of a different faith they look down on people who are a different color in fact we're all americans the only way we're going to bring this country together is bring everybody together there's nothing we cannot do if we do it together we can take this on and we can defeat racism president i mean president trump sir during the obama biden administration there was tremendous division there was hatred you look at ferguson you look at you go to very many places look at oakland look what happened in oakland look what happened in baltimore look what happened frankly it was more violent than what i'm even seeing now but the reason is that the democrats that run these cities don't want to talk like you about law and order are you violence favor of law and order i'm in favor of law you follow are you in favor of the lord you ask a question with justice where people get treated fairly and the fact of the matter is violent crime went down 17 15 in our administration it's gone up on his watch much more all right mr president mr president every record in the mr president you're going to be very happy because we're not going to talk about law enforcement because we had trouble with democratic-run cities that's exactly my question there has been a dramatic increase in homicides in america this summer particularly and you often blame that on democratic mayors and democratic governors but in fact there have been equivalent spikes in republican-led cities like tulsa and fort worth so the question is is this really a party issue i think it's a party issue you can bring in a couple of examples but if you look at chicago what's going on in chicago where 53 people were shot and eight died shot if you look at new york where it's going up like nobody's ever seen anything the numbers are going up a hundred hundred and fifty two hundred percent uh crime it is crazy what's going on and he doesn't want to say law and order because he can't because he'll lose his radical left supporters and once he does that it's over with but if he ever got to run this country and they ran it the way he would want to run it we would have our suburbs would be gone by the way our suburbs would be gone and you would see problems like he would have never a suburb unless he took a wrong turn oh i know celebrities i was raised in the suburbs this is not 1950. all these dog whistles and racism don't work anymore suburbs are by and large integrated there's many people today driving their kids to soccer practice and or to black and white and hispanic in the same car as there have been any time in the past what's what really is a threat to the suburbs and their safety is his failure to deal with covet they're dying in the suburbs his failure to deal with the environment they're being flooded they're being burned out because his refusal to do anything that's why the suburbs are interested i do want to talk about this issue of law and order though and in the joint recommendation that came from the biden bernie sanders task force you talked about quote reimagining policing first of all what does reimagining policing mean and do you support it means let me if i might finish the question what does reimagining policing mean and do you support the black lives matter uh call for uh for community control of policing look what i support is the police having the opportunity to deal with the problems they face and i'm not totally opposed to defunding the police officers as a matter of fact police local police the only one defunding in his budget calls for a 400 million dollar cut in local law enforcement assistance they need more assistance they need when they show up for a 9 11 call to have someone with them as a psychologist or psychiatrist to keep them from having to use force and be able to talk people down we have to have community policing like we had before where the officers get to know the people in the communities that's when crime went down it didn't go up it went down and so we have to be in this case they're talking about chris that's not where they are he's talking about defunding the police that is not true he doesn't have any law support he has no law enforcement that's not true that's not look who do you have name one group that supports you name one group that came out and supported you go ahead i think we have time we don't have time to do anything all right one law enforcement group that came back gentlemen i think i'm going to i'm going to take back the moderators and i want to get to another subject which is the issue of protests in many cities that have turned violent in portland oregon especially we had a more than a hundred straight days of protests which i think you would agree you talk about peaceful protests many of those turned into riots mr vice president you say that people who commit crimes should be held accountable the question i have though is as the democratic nominee and earlier tonight you said that you are the democratic party right now have you ever called the democratic mayor of portland or the democratic governor of oregon and said hey you've got to stop this bring in the national guard do whatever it takes but you'd stop the days and months of violence in portland i don't hold public office now i am a former vice president i've made it clear i've made it clear in my public statements that the violence should be prosecuted it should be prosecuted and anyone who commits it for the people excuse me sir you had never called for the leaders in portland and in oregon to call us bring in the national guard and knock off a hundred days of riots they can in fact take care of it if he just stay out of the way look here oh really here oh really nobody get the killer of the young man in the middle of the street they shot him and for three days president trump portland didn't do anything i had interrupted the us marshall go ahead sir and by the way you know his own former spokesperson said you know riots and chaos and violence helpless cause that's what this is all about i don't know who said that i do who i think kellyanne conway i don't think she said she said that and so here's that but here's the point the point is that that's what he is keeps trying to rile everything up he doesn't want to calm things down instead of going in and talking to people and saying let's get everybody together figure out how to deal with this what's he do he just pours gasoline in the fire constantly and every single solitary okay and to end this button up this segment i'm going to give you a minute to answer sir you have repeatedly criticized i have to answer his stuff you haven't stated no you've been talking you made a statement i'm asking you i would love to know sir i would love to you know if you want to switch seats we could very quickly that but i'd say the national guard it would be over there'd be no problem okay but they don't want to accept the national guard you have repeatedly criticized the vice president for not specifically calling out antifa and other left-wing extremist groups but are you willing tonight to condemn white supremacists and militia groups and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities as we saw in kenosha and as we've seen in portland are you prepared to do this do it i would say almost everything i see is from the left wing not from the right what are you what are you what are you saying i'm willing to do anything i want to see peace sir say it do it say it do you want to call him what do you want to call him give me your name give me a white surprise and would you like me to continue proud stand back and stand by but i'll tell you what i'll tell you what somebody's got to do something about antifa and the left because this is not a right-wing problem this is a left-handed director this is a left-wing white supremacist antifa is an idea not an organization you got it that's what his tonight fbi your administration tells you the truth is it has a bad idea what you i'm going to ask a question when the president seeks a second term it is generally a referendum on his record but vice president biden you like to quote one of your dad's sayings which is don't compare me to the almighty compare me to the alternative and in this case sir you are the alternative looking at both of your records i'm going to ask each of you why should voters elect you president over your opponent in this segment president trump you go first two minutes because there has never been an administration or president who has done more than i've done in a period of three and a half years and that's despite the impeachment hoax and you saw what happened today with hillary clinton where it was a whole big con job but despite going through all of these things where i had to fight both flanks and behind me and above there has never been an administration that's done what i've done the greatest before covet came in the greatest economy in history lowest employ unemployment numbers everything was good everything was going and by the way there was unity going to happen people were calling me for the first time in years they were calling and they were saying it's time maybe and then what happened we got hit but now we're building it back up again a rebuilding of the military including space force and all of the other things a a fixing of the the va which was a mess under him 308 000 people died because they didn't have proper health care he was a mess and we now got a 91 approval rating at the va our vets we take care of our vets but we've rebuilt our military the job that we've done and i'll tell you something some people say maybe the most important by the end of the first term i'll have approximately 300 federal judges and court of appeals judges 300 and hopefully three great supreme court judges justices that is a record the likes of which very few people and you know one of the reasons i'll have so many judges because president obama and him left me 128 judges to fill when you leave office you don't leave any judges that's like you just don't do that they left 128 openings and if i were a member of his party because they have a little different philosophy i'd say if you left us 128 openings you can't be a good president you can't be a good vice president but i want to thank you because it gives us almost it'll probably be above that number by the end of this term 300 judges it's a record looking at both your records why should voters elect you president as opposed to president trump you have two minutes uninterrupted under this president we become weaker sicker poor more divided and more violent when i was vice president we inherited a recession i was asked to fix it i did we left him a booming economy and he caused a recession with regard to being weaker the fact is that i've gone head-to-head with putin and made it clear to him we're not going to take any of his stuff he's putin's puppy he still refuses to even say anything to putin about the bounty on the heads of american soldiers million dollars and by the way mr price wait a minute mr president your campaign agreed to both sides would get two minute answers uninterrupted well your your side agreed to it and why don't you observe what your campaign agreed to as a ground rule okay sir he never keeps his words no no i'm not absolutely that was a rhetorical question can you go back 30 seconds yes you may have all right go ahead so thirdly we're poor the billionaires have gotten much much more wealthy by a tune of over three to four hundred billion dollars more just since covent you in the home you got less you're in more trouble than you were before in terms of being more violent when we were in office there were 15 percent less violence in america than there is today he's president united states it's on his watch and with regard to more divided the nation can't stay divided we can't be this way and speaking of my son the way you talk about the military the way you talk about them being losers and being and and and just being suckers my son was in iraq he spent a year there he got he got the bronze star he got the conspicuous service medal he was not a loser he was a patriot and the people left behind there were heroes and i resent you talking about hunter are you talking about i'm talking about my son beau biden you're talking i don't know i don't know beau i know hunter got thrown out of the military he was thrown out dishonorably discharged that's not true cocaine use and he didn't have a job until you became vice president what do you mean he made a fortune in ukraine in china in moscow is simply various other places my son fortunately generally my son and he didn't have a judge my son like a lot of people like a lot of people we know at home had a drug problem he's overtaken it he's he's fixed it he's worked on it and i'm proud of him but why was he giving him millions all right but he wasn't giving 10 million that is totally president totally you've already been through totally credited we've already been through this i think the american people would rather hear about more substantial subjects well you know as the moderator sir i'm going to make a judgment call here three and a half million dollars from the mayor about moscow i think that report mitt romney on that committee said it wasn't worth taxpayers money that reporter was written for political reasons you know i'd like to talk about climate change joe and i okay the forest fires in the west are raging now they have burned millions of acres they have displaced hundreds of thousands of people when state officials there blame the fires on climate change mr president you said i don't think the science knows over your four years you have pulled the us out of the paris climate accord you have rolled back a number of obama environmental records what do you believe about the science of climate change and what will you do in the next four years to confront it i want crystal clean water and air i want beautiful clean air we have now the lowest carbon if you look at our numbers right now we are doing phenomenally but i haven't destroyed our businesses our businesses aren't put out of commission if you look at the paris accord it was a disaster from our standpoint and people are actually very happy about what's going on because our businesses are doing well as far as the fires are concerned you need forest management in addition to everything else the forest floors are loaded up with trees dead trees that are years old and they're like tinder and leaves and everything else you drop a cigarette in there the whole forest burns down you've got to have forest management what do you believe what do you believe about the science of climate change sir i believe that we have to do everything we can to have immaculate air immaculate water and do whatever else we can that's good you know we're planting a billion trees the billion tree project project and it's very exciting i believe that human pollution gas greenhouse gas emissions contributes to the global warming i think a lot of things do but i think to an extent yes i think to an extent yes but i also think we have to do better management of our forests every year i get the call california's burning california is burning if that was cleaned if that were if you had forest management good forest management you wouldn't be getting those calls you know in europe they live their forest cities they call forest cities they maintain their forest they manage their forests i was with the head of a major country it's a forest city he said sir we have trees that are far more they they ignite much easier than california there shouldn't be that problem i spoke with the governor about it i'm getting along very well with the governor but i said you know at some point you can't every year have hundreds of thousands of acres of land just burned to the ground but that's burning down because of a lack of sir if you believe in the science of climate change why have you rolled back the obama clean power plan which limited carbon emissions in power plants why have you relaxed because it was driving energy prices through the sky why have you relaxed fuel economy standards that are going to create more pollution from cars well not really because what's happening is the car is much less expensive and it's a much safer car and you're talking about a tiny difference and then what would happen because of the cost of the car you would have at least double and triple the number of cars purchased we have the old slugs out there that are 10 12 years old if you did that the car would be safer it would be much cheaper but they've simply take a lot of cars off the market because people would be able to afford a car now so and by the way we're going to see how that turns out but a lot of people agree with me many people the car has gotten so expensive because they have computers all over the place for an extra little bit okay of gasoline and and i'm okay with electric cars too i think i'm all for electric cars i've given big incentives for electric cars but what they've done in california is just crazy vice president biden i'd like you to to respond to the president's climate change record but i also want to ask you about a concern you propose two trillion dollars in green jobs you talk about new limits not abolishing but new limits on fracking ending the use of fossil fuels to generate electricity by 2035 and zero net emission of greenhouse gases by 2050. the president says a lot of these things would tank the economy and cost millions of jobs he's absolutely wrong number one number two if in fact when our during our administration the recovery act i was able to i was in charge able to bring down the cost of renewable energy to cheaper than or as cheap as coal and gas and oil nobody's going to build another uh coal-fired plant in america no one's going to build another oil-fired plant in america they're going to move to renewable energy number one number two we're going to make sure that we are able to take the federal fleet and turn it into a fleet that's run on their electric vehicles making sure that we can do that we're going to put 500 000 charging stations and all of the highways that we're going to be building in the future we're going to build a economy that in fact is going to provide for the ability us to take 4 million buildings and make sure that they in fact are weatherized in a way that in fact they'll emit significantly less gas and oil because the heat will not be going out there's so many things that we can do now to create thousands and thousands of jobs we can get to net zero in terms of energy production by 2035 not only not costing people jobs creating jobs creating millions of good paying jobs not 15 bucks an hour but prevailing wage by having a new infrastructure that in fact is green and the first thing i will do i will rejoin the paris accord i will join the paris accord because with us out of it look what's happening it's all falling apart and talk about someone who has no no relationship to with foreign policy brazil the rainforest of brazil are being torn down or being ripped down more more carbon is absorbed in that rainforest than every bit of carbon that's admitted in the united states instead of doing something about that i would be gathering up and making sure we had to come the countries of the world coming up with 20 billion dollars say here's 20 billion dollars stop stop tearing down the forest and if you don't then you're going to have significant economic consequences what about the argument that president trump basically says that you have to balance environmental interests and economic interests and he's drawn his line well he hadn't drawn a line he still for example make sure that we he wants to make sure that methane is not a problem we can you can now emit more methane without it being a problem methane this is a guy who says that you don't have to have mileage standards for automobiles that exist now this is a guy who says that the fact that it's all true and here's thinking about the green new deal and it's not 2 billion or 20 billion as you said it's 100 trillion dollars i'm talking about they want to rip down buildings and rebuild the building it's the dumbest most redundant where two car systems are out where they want to take out the cows too you know that's not true either right this is a this is a 100 trillion that's more money than our country could make a hundred years if we're not the case all right let me let me let me just because i actually wait a minute sir i actually have studied your plan and it includes upgrading four million buildings weatherizing two million homes over four years building one and a half million energy efficient homes so the question becomes some the president is saying i think some people who support the president would say that sounds like it's going to cost a lot of money and hurt the economy what it's going to do it's going to create thousands and millions of jobs good paying jobs let him finish sir he doesn't know how to do that 100 billion the fact is it's going to create millions of good paying jobs and these tax incentives to people for people to weatherize which he wants to get get rid of it's going to make the economy much safer look how much we're paying now to deal with the hurricanes with deal with by the way he has an answer for hurricanes he said maybe we should drop a nuclear weapon on them they may i never said that actually he did made it up uh and here's the deal you make up we we are going to be in a position where we can create hard hard good jobs by making sure the environment is clean and we all are in better shape we spend billions of dollars now billions of dollars on floods hurricanes rising seas we're in real trouble look what's happening just in the midwest with these storms that come through and wipe out an entire sections and counties in iowa they didn't happen before they're because of global warming we make up 15 percent of the world's problem we in fact but the rest of the world we've got to get them to come along that's why we have to get back into back into the paris accord all right gentlemen chris so why didn't he do it for 47 years you were vice president why didn't you get the world china sends up real dirt into the air russia does india does they all do we're supposed to be good and by the way he made a couple of statements the green new deal is a hundred trillion dollars he said i said something about the military he and his friends made it up and then they went with it i never said okay the final question is i can't remember which of all is rantings i'm having a little trouble myself but uh and about the economy and about this question of what it's going to cost the the economy i mean the green new deal and the idea of what what your environmental changes will do the green new deal will pay for itself as we move forward we're not going to build plants that in fact are great polluting plants are you going to build a brand new deal pardon me you support no i don't support the green new deal don't oh well that's a big statement i support you that's the radical left i suspect i support the biden plan that i put forward okay the biden plan which is different than what he calls the radical green new deal all right gentlemen final segment election integrity as we meet tonight millions of americans are receiving mail-in ballots or going to vote early how confident should we be that this will be a fair election and what are you prepared to do over the next five plus weeks because it'll not only be to election day but also counting some ballots mail-in ballots after election day what are you prepared to do to reassure the american people that the next president will be the legitimate winner of this election in this final segment mr vice president you go first prepare to let people vote they should go to iwillvote.com decide how they're going to vote when they're going to vote and what means by which they're going to vote his own homeland security director as well as the fbi director says there is no evidence at all that mail and ballots are a source of of being manipulated and cheating they said that the fact is that there are going to be millions of people because of covet that are going to be voting by mail and ballots like he does by the way he sits behind the resolute desk and sends his ballot to florida number one number two we're going to make sure that those people who want to vote in person are able to vote because enough poll watchers are there to make sure they can socially distance the polls are open on time and their polls stay open until the votes are counted and this is all about trying to dissuade people from voting because he's trying to con to scare people into thinking that it's not going to be legitimate show up and vote you will determine the outcome of this election vote vote vote if you're able to vote early in your state vote early if you're able to vote in person vote in person vote whatever way is the best way for you because you will he cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of this election and in terms of whether or not when the votes are counted and they're all counted that will be accepted if i win that will be accepted if i lose it'll be accepted but by the way if in fact he says he's not sure what he's going to accept well let me tell you something it doesn't matter because if we get the votes it's going to be all over he's going to go he can't stay in power it won't happen it won't happen so vote just make sure you understand you have it in your control to determine what this country is going to look like the next four years is it going to change you get four more years of these lies mr president two minutes so when i listened to joe talking about a transition there's been no transition from when i won i won that election and if you look at crooked hillary clinton if you look at all of the different people there was no transition because they came after me trying to do a coup they came after me spying on my campaign they started from the day i won and even before i won from the day i came down the escalator with our first lady they were a disaster they were disgraced to our country and we've caught them we've caught them all we've got it all on tape we've caught them all and by the way you gave the idea for the logan act against general flynn you better take a look at that because we caught you in a sense and president obama was sitting in the office he knew about it too so don't tell me about a free transition as far as the ballots are concerned it's a disaster a solicited ballot okay solicited is okay you're soliciting you're asking they send it back you send it back i did that if you have an unsolicited they're sending millions of ballots all over the country there's fraud they found him in creeks they found some with the name trump just happened to have the name trump just the other day in a waste paper basket they're being sent all over the place they sent two in a democrat area they sent out a thousand ballots everybody got two ballots this is going to be a fraud like you've never seen the other thing it's nice on november 3rd you're watching and you see who won the election and i think we're going to do well because people are really happy with the job we've done but you know what we won't know we might not know for months because these ballots are going to be all over take a look at what happened in manhattan take a look at what happened in new jersey take a look at what happened in virginia and other places they're not losing two percent one percent which by the way is too much an election can be won or lost with that they'll listen 30 and 40 percent it's a fraud and it's a shame and can you imagine where they say uh you have to have your ballot in by november 10th november 10th that means that's seven days after the election in theory should have been announced okay we have made your states with that sir all run by democrats two minutes all run by democrats president trump it's a rig you're going to be able to continue you have been charging for months and mail-in balloting is going to be a disaster you say it's rigged that it's going to lead to fraud but in 2018 in the last midterm election 31 million people voted mail-in voting that was a quarter more than a quarter of all the voters that year cast their ballots by mail now that millions of mail-in ballots have gone out what are you going to do about it and are you counting on the supreme court including a justice barrett to settle any decisions yeah i think i'm counting on them to look at the ballots definitely i don't think well i hope we don't need them in terms of the election itself but for the ballots i think so because what's happening is incredible i just heard i read today where at least one percent of the ballots for 2016 were invalidated they they take them we don't like them we don't like them millions of ballots i'm asking you about the fact that millions of people you go and vote you go and vote like they used to millions of people you either do chris a solicited ballot where you're sending it in they're sending it back and you're sending they have mailman with lots of it did you see what's going on take a look at west virginia mailman selling the ballots they're being sold they're being dumped in rivers this is a horrible thing for our country this is not there is no this is not going to end well okay this is nice five states have had mail-in ballots for the last decade or more five including two republican states and you don't have to solicit the ballot it's sent to you it's sent to your home what we're saying is they're saying is that it has to be a postmark by the time by election day if it doesn't get in until the seventh eighth ninth it still should be counted he's just afraid of counting the votes because you're wrong i want to continue with you on this vice president because he's so wrong when he makes a statement excuse me vice president biden the biggest problem in fact over the years with mail-in voting has not been fraud historically it has been that sizable numbers sometimes hundreds of thousands of ballots are thrown out because they have not been properly filled out or there is some other irregularity or they must be through the deadline so the question i have is are you concerned that the supreme court with a justice barrett will settle any dispute i'm concerned that any court would settle this because here's the deal when you when you file when you get a ballot and you fill it out you're supposed to have an affidavit if you didn't know you have someone say that this is me you should be able to if in fact you can verify that you when the before the ballot is thrown out that's sufficient to be able to count the ballot because someone made a mistake and not dotting the correct eye who they voted for testify say who they voted for say it's you that is totally legitimate all right excited i have a fight it's swamping my system you you know it can't be done you know it can't and already election workers are prohibited currently by law eight states from even beginning to process ballots even take them out of the envelopes and flatten them until election day that means that it's likely because there's going to be a huge increase in mail-in balloting that we are not going to know on election night who the winner is that it could be days it could be weeks until we find out who the the new president is so i first for you sir finally for the for the vice president i hope neither of you will interrupt the other will you urge your supporters to stay calm during this extended period not to engage in any civil unrest and will you pledge tonight that you will not declare victory until the election has been independently certified president trump i'm urging my supporters to go into the polls and watch very carefully because that's what has to happen i am urging them to do it as you know today there was a big problem in philadelphia they went in to watch they were called poll watchers a very safe very nice thing they were thrown out they weren't allowed to watch you know why because bad things happen in philadelphia bad things and i am urging i am urging my people i hope it's going to be a fair election if it's a fair election i am hundred percent on board but if i see tens of thousands of ballots being manipulated i can't go along with that and i'll tell you what is that from a common sense does that mean you're telling people it means you have a fraudulent election you're sending out 80 these people aren't equipped to handle it number one number two they cheat they cheat hey they found ballots in a waste paper basket three days ago and they all had the name military ballots they were military they all had the name trump on them vice versa i think that's good vice president biden final question for you will you urge your supporters to stay calm while the vote is counted and will you pledge not to declare victory until the election is independently certified yes and here's the deal we count the balance as you pointed out some of these ballots in some states can't even be opened until election day and if there's thousands of ballots going to take time to do it and by the way our military they've been voting by ballots first since at the end of the civil war in effect and that's and that's what's happened going to happen why was it not why is it for them somehow not fraudulent it's the same process it's honest no one has established at all that there is fraud related to male imbalance that somehow it's a fraudulent process it's already been established [Music] he has no idea what he's talking about here's the deal the fact is i will accept it and he will too you know why because once the winner is declared after all the all the ballots are counted all the votes are counted that'll be the end of it that'll be the end of it and if it's me in fact fine if it's not me i'll support the outcome and i'll be a president not just for the democrats i'll be a president for democrats and republicans and this guy i want to see honestly gentlemen would you say that's the end of this this is the end of this debate this ballot count to be continued as in more debates as we go on uh president trump vice president biden it's been an interesting hour and a half i want to thank you both for participating in the first of three debates that you have agreed to engage in we want to thank case western reserve university and the cleveland clinic for hosting this event the next debate sponsored by the commission on presidential debates will be one week from tomorrow october 7th at the university of utah in salt lake city the two vice presidential nominees vice president mike pence and senator kamala harris will debate at 9 pm eastern that night we hope you watch until then thank you and good night if hearing that this debate is over with music to your ears you may not be alone uh what could have been a low point in american political discourse certainly in any modern debate we've seen just took place over an hour and a half if you showed up looking for a food fight you got a brawl between these two men language that we have rarely heard from candidates in a political debate a name that that went to a new level uh frankly savannah guthrum i'm a bit of loss for words here to describe what we've just witnessed well maybe because i think like so many in this country watching this your jaw just dropped you can't pretend that this was a normal debate a normal example of american democracy at work a normal you know tussle between foes this was different this was a an all-out grudge match it was undignified at many times it was cringe-worthy at many times um and you you just as i turned to chuck we can't pretend i can't go to you chuck with my normal give me some political analysis question because i think we need to just pause for a moment and say that was crazy what was that it was a train wreck um but it was a train wreck of the making of one person i mean we know who did it president trump did this and in some ways it's the only way he knows what to do he bulldozed over the moderator he bulldozed over chris wallace bulldozed and at times flustered joe biden but i don't know if anybody wouldn't have been flustered by the president's behavior in the president's performance it is it was a pure train wreck i don't know how that helped anybody if if you were watching this as an undecided voter i don't know if it helped at all uh you just i don't know what you learned did you stay on the channel i got a lot of text from people saying i turned it off yeah i've gotten a lot of those comments too both from true outsiders and from friends and family a lot of people seem to turn this one off it is it is um again i go back i'm trying to figure out and i'm trying to find okay did this politically help anybody i will say this joe biden's campaign has been trying to make the case essentially that president trump is a fraud a bully and has no plans that was one thing that seemed to get through i think at times and certainly president trump played the role of the bully quite well the trump campaign has been trying to paint joe biden as out of it and captive of the left uh i think his folks are going to think that the president scored some points here or there but i you know i'm looking at it i think a lot of people are going to look at this and feel perhaps a tad empathetic for anybody that had to participate in this let me go to andrea mitchell right now andrea many of the things that we talked about the last couple of days came true in terms of the president's strategy to try to get under joe biden's skin he went after his son hunter on a number of occasions including when vice president biden was talking about his son beau who had died honorably serving as a soldier true i mean but this was such a hot mess you can you can fault joe biden perhaps for letting the president get him rattled and for not drilling down on the tax issue and other issues but frankly the format and that you have to you have to fault the moderator in the way the questions were posed once president trump was rolling over them and bulldozing them because they didn't talk about covet nearly as much as race and violence and protests i mean it was really really in the ballpark of the president because he kept bringing things back to that issue and not letting joe biden answer a question so by blowing it all up and running roughshod over everyone else he didn't let joe biden make the points that he was prepared to make until perhaps the last half hour last hour perhaps 45 minutes where biden seemed to regain his footing and the contrast was clear but i i've been watching debates covering debates since 1976. i've never seen anything like this i don't think any of us have compare it to any debate in presidential history this was a disgrace frankly and the president just did not observe any of the format that his own campaign had agreed to so i'm not sure what joe biden could have done other than trying to get a word in and trying to answer the questions that were asked well let me go to hallie jackson who is at the debate hall i mean couple things here the famous maxim inside trump world is let trump be trump he definitely was trump but even even kind of a super-sized version of himself so whether or not that was part of the strategy i'd like to hear you on whether or not the the campaign was going in there with that motivation and biden on the other hand uh he did have his opportunities did he make the most of them or did he did he lose opportunities a couple of things on that savannah when you talk about the idea of the president's strategy going into this and the idea of letting trump be trump as is so often said listen the campaign uh sources close to the preparations here had said they wanted to see the president go on attack that was part of what they were coming into this with obviously that happened that was an incredibly aggressive donald trump on stage tonight he went after as expected hunter biden multiple times of course the vice president's son you talk about savannah vice president biden being on defense to that degree because of the nature of the interruptions frankly from the president it seemed like it was difficult for joe biden to be able to push back in any substantive way when the president was sort of rat-tat-tat with these attacks on biden repeatedly over and over again on hunter biden i can tell you that there is already sort of appreciation from people in trump world for those hunter biden attacks that is something you're going to be hearing over the next 24 48 hours and beyond as chuck points out there are some different moments that people who support president trump are seizing on to to say listen he was on his game he had energy is sort of the thinking here he came out and attacked on the other hand i think it is notable when we talk about the substance of this debate a couple of points and things that the president simply did not say it cannot go unnoticed that joe biden the former vice president directly called president trump a racist president trump did not respond to that the president was directly asked to denounce white supremacy and the proud boys the president said stand back and stand by which is not a denunciation the president was directly asked to urge calm to his supporters during the vote count ahead of election day president trump did not do that i think substantively those are some of the things that you're going to be hearing about over the next couple of days and just to give you a sense i have to tell you inside this debate hall i've been to other debates this was very different for a lot of reasons notably from some of the coveted precautions and the much smaller audience it was a much more intimate haul feeling and that made it jarring frankly to see this chaos on the stage go down just as somebody who is inside the room here all right let's bring in our guest rich lowry editor of the national review also claire mccaskill former democratic senator from missouri both are nbc news political contributors uh senator let me first talk to you about where there's a lot of focus obviously on what donald trump did and his performance but isolating if you can joe biden his reaction to it his uh losing his temper at at times how much does that hurt him i i listen anybody who tries to characterize this debate as somehow equivalent in terms of the behavior of those two candidates is not being fair to joe biden donald trump was a bully he was non-presidential he was frankly outrageous it was sad to watch it as an american he's the president of united states and he behaved like a 12th grader it was terrible and joe biden i think showed presidential self-control now did he call tell him to be quiet a couple of times frankly i'm you know i was watching i want to throttle the guy and chris wallace i mean i know it must be hard to control it but he really got run over by donald trump's outrageous behavior on that stage tonight now will it hurt donald trump politically i'm not sure it will with his supporters but i guarantee it won't help him with those women in the suburbs it will not help him well that was the question i wanted to ask rich lowry who of course is the editor of the conservative national review i mean look if you are a donald trump supporter this was a great night for you you love this guy but what about those undecided voters what about suburban women what about people who are on the fence do you feel that aggressive performance was a good look for donald trump well i think the whole night was dispiriting i i wouldn't be surprised if there's not another presidential debate in the cycle and at the very least i think the presidential debate commission has to consider cutting off the mics of the people who aren't supposed the person who's not supposed to be speaking and whose time it isn't but look um this was trump's strategy and even it wasn't a strategy this is his nature this is the way he is and i think you know he flustered biden at times the the shut up man wasn't great at the beginning from from joe biden biden was evasive on some key questions but really importantly he didn't buckle you know he stood there for 90 minutes and took it and gave as good as he got and with trump i think the problem is especially with hunter biden some of the points he was trying to make didn't really land that well because of his own jagged style and his own over-interrupting so i agree with claire i'm not sure it hurts him but it's someone who is unsettled by the way he's conducted himself as president but is on the fence about him are they going to look at his performance and say that's my guy unlikely so it's probably a status quo debate but it's trump that needs trajectory this race to change all right rich thank you we're going to take a quick break here we'll be back with more on tonight's debate in just a moment [Music] this is a situation where the state continues to struggle to expand its testing capabilities protesters feel that they need to come out in full force and support their community because

nominee uh joe biden on monday next monday from miami at 8 7 central time we hope you will join us then savannah all right as i turn to casey hunner capitol hill correspondent i mean debates are this kind of cherished ritual of our democracy and of presidential campaigns a lot of folks remember watching them as little kids can you imagine uh how you'd feel if you were a mom or dad with your kids watching that debacle tonight i wonder what you're hearing from your sources on on the hill and in the campaigns do you think there's a chance that either one or both of the campaigns just says forget it we're not doing any further debates there are two more presidential debates scheduled one vice presidential debate scheduled well savannah first of all i'm grateful my son was too young to watch that very different from the ones i remember watching as a young child part of which made me want to be involved in the american political process in the first place there are certainly sources in both parties who are currently suggesting to me that perhaps it's joe biden at this point who should not participate in future debates as we were negotiating up to this process remember there was a lot of concern about whether president trump was going to be the one to show up and a lot of the ways that this was negotiated including the moderator choices and some other things seem to suggest that perhaps it was oriented at him uh but now i've got more than one source who are saying hey you know maybe joe biden doesn't benefit very much uh from coming back out onto a stage like this savannah all right casey hold that thought another break now we'll be back with some final reflections in just a moment [Music] [Music] this is a situation where the state continues to struggle to expand its testing capabilities protesters feel that they need to come out in full force and support their community because they feel like they're not getting that support from the fulton police
