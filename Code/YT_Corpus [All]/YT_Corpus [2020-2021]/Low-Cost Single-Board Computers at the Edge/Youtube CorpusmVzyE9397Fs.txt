 hello and welcome to this session in the global your boot camp on Windows virtual desktop. so my name is Tom Hillen, I'm a Windows virtual desktop global black belt at Microsoft that does not require any martial arts skills but rather it just denotes a specialization and as the name suggests that specialization is in Windows virtual desktop so just a brief intro to myself I've been around in the enterprise IT space for well over 25 years architecting infrastructure for some large enterprise customers these always have a focus though on end-user computing I thought I'd escaped end-user computing when I joined Microsoft as a cloud solution architect about five years ago that which is helping lots of customers with any kind of infrastructure project in Azure but as it always is the case end user computer tends to pull you back in and it did that for me when Citrix released Citrix cloud just over three years ago running in Azure and I started then to focus on that helping customers deploying virtual desktop deployments in Azure which has led then led on to my position as a global power for wvd so now I help Microsoft customers in deploying wvd in there are your subscriptions as well as helping out the wider community so let's start with introduction to Windows virtual desktop or W VDS I'm going to refer to as so this is a microsoft management service for the orchestration energy or of customers VDI or single session desktops as well as RDS H so remote desktop session hosts otherwise known as multi session so what this is is a service running natively in a job so that customers do not have to go and deploy all of the roles on virtual machines that they would have had to have done in the past up until this time it is also the next major evolution of our RDS capabilities so this has been the technology that has enabled this to work on premises now what that in reality actually means is we are no longer to plant dependent upon Windows Server 4 RDS capabilities now Windows Server was released every four or five years which meant the customers had to wait for that period of time in order to get new IDs capabilities so we're going to a bit more detail about what that looks like but in essence that dependency has been removed and has been replaced with Azure providing the underlying technology to support that service so as part of WD we enabled a new feature of Windows 10 called Windows 10 multi-session what this provides is the capability of having multiple users logged in simultaneously to the same Windows 10 p.m. now this has never been possible up until this point in time now this is a feature of wvd it is not a window SKU that you can go and purchase and download and run on-premises this can only be run inside a wvd we also support Windows 7 VDI so this is a one-to-one mapping to Windows 7 vm included with that is free extended security updates from January the 14th 2010 24 3 years we also support every flavor of Windows Server RDS from 2012 r2 and up and it's one single service for the management of both published applications as well as published desktops from the one single service and whilst this runs exclusively inside of Azure it is actually a feature of M 365 or Microsoft 365 what that enables is a lot of the features and capabilities that are inherent in Microsoft 365 can be used on top of wvd where it makes sense and where it's appropriate so things like is your a Active Directory conditional access privileged access those kinds of service services become relevant with wvd so this is a very high-level overview of the wvd architecture and it's effectively made up of two boxes the first at the top is the wvd management plane and this is the component that is managed and operated by Microsoft so from a customer's perspective they do not need to do any forecasting of usage any procurement any ordering any racking and stacking there's no deployment no ongoing patching no support no keeping this service alive that's fully operated by Microsoft as an evergreen service to you our customer now when I mentioned earlier that this was the next major revolution of RDS what that actually means is typically when customers did RDS or Zen Apple horizon on-premises they would go and deploy some virtual machines now let's take example this web access layer so the remote desktop website that's a website that had to be deployed on top of high is which was obviously installed into probably a couple or more virtual machines behind a load balancer for AJ now that is not what is being deployed in Azure for this service what's actually happened here is that website has been moved into as your app service and as your app service is a large as your service for the hosting of web applications and we've got lots of customers whose entire business upon a single as your app service and the rest and that applies to the other services here so what that means is that the RDS or the wvd product group are able to release updates into Azure at a much quicker cadence we're talking weeks rather than potentially five years to get new capability out to our customers and that obviously is running upon Azure and Azure is getting updates across the board at a much quicker rate than that so potentially there's updates dropping into the service and every single day so that's an example of how we have evolved the service and have broken that dependency upon releases of Windows Server so that that's the top management plain box the second component is your Azure subscription now this is where you have absolute total control around what you deploy and how you architect it so into here you would deploy all of the virtual machines that you wanted for the hosting of your desktops and your line of business applications now all of those virtual machines reside on what's referred to as AV net or virtual network so it's stock standard networking services here but what that also opens up is the opportunity to connect back to any on-premise services so we have a service called Express route which is our recommendation for this type of workload which will connect as your back to your on-premise locations enabling you to continue to consume any back-end services or any management services that you want to continue to manage these virtual machines so something like SCCM or other services for software distribution or something like an anti-virus master server pushing out updates to these virtual machines and then obviously all of those virtual machines reside upon our IR service and that's where we manage up to the hypervisor and then you manage the operating system and above and this slide here shows you these your geographies where the current Windows virtual desktop gateway services located so every starred location on there is running the wvd management plane all of these locations or the service within those locations sits behind a thing called as your front door which is doing the global load balancing for your incoming user connections through the management plane to those virtual machines so you will be directed to the closest one of these starred as your regions in order to consume the wbd service just for specific reference these are the usual geographies that the wbd management plane is currently available in so as originally available in the US and Europe and then recently is being rolled out to those geographies that you see listed there and new your geographies will be coming on board over time if you did want to estimate the user experience of your users connecting into the wvd management plane you can go to this URL and it will take your DNS location and provide an estimate of that latency into that management plane and so just as a reminder these are the supported operating systems within wvd so we support as mentioned Windows 7 and that's single session so true VDI and it is also published desktops only so no remotes out capability coming from Windows 7 we also support Windows 10 Enterprise single session again true VDI and then we move into the multi session capabilities so this new flavor of Windows 10 multi session which we'll go into in a second and then every flavor of Windows Server RDS from 2012 up a bit more detail about Windows 10 multi-session so up until this point in time customers have only had two choices of the virtual machines they can deploy into this type of capability the left-hand side here is explaining the Windows Server experience now Windows Server by virtue of RDS has been great because of the scalability capability that it has so you can have multiple users logged on to the same VM at the same point in time now that's been great because it reduces your infrastructure which in turn reduces your complexity and hopefully reduces your costs associated with that however it is Windows Server now most users wouldn't be able to tell the difference because we can make it look like Windows clients but it is Windows Server under the hood and that's important to IT it is multiple sessions as we've mentioned but it only supports Windows 32 apps here so nothing from the store if that was a requirement it is office 365 ProPlus but it is in our long-term servicing channel so this is that dependency upon Windows server being updated every four or five years or whatever it might be now the problem with Windows Server has been application compatibility now I'm sure you've come across at least one app out there that for whatever reason does not work on Windows Server and when customers come up against an app like that they typically mitigate that by deploying it via VDI which is displayed which is described on the right hand side here so VDI is great because it is that true Windows 10 user experience that customers are expecting but it is obviously single session so that's going to increase the requirements for infrastructure and obviously the costs associated with that because you need more infrastructure to support the same number of users as you use via RDS it is however Windows 32 apps as well as anything from the store so if you did want to deploy edge or anything else from the store you then you can absolutely do that it is also office 365 ProPlus and it is in our semi your channel which means that you will get two updates a year to Windows 10 one of which you can defer now customers have really been articulating the problems inherent in both of these and Microsoft have listened and have filled the gap which this new capability which is obviously Windows 10 multi session which we think is the best of both worlds and we say that because it's got the same or similar scalability as RDS so you can have multiple users locked on to the same Windows 10 VM at the same point in time combined with the true rich Windows 10 user experience the customers have come to expect it also supports all types of apps so windows 32-bit as well as anything from the store it is office 365 ProPlus and it is in our semi and your channel so what that means is that with Windows 10 multi session you are getting an evergreen version of the OS combined with an evergreen version of office being orchestrated by an evergreen management plane so that's a brief intro to Windows 10 multi-session but what about the virtual machines that you could potentially be running those on well this is a non exhaustive list of the some of the virtual machine families that we have available in Azure that can be used in a wvd deployment now typically what we tend to find is that customers keep the virtual machines that they have to there for their users to a bare minimum so it might be three maybe four virtual machine sizes so something like small medium and large and anything else is handled as an exception now that is done really to keep eyeties life simple because it takes time to deploy these remote machines and it takes time to architect the choices available to those cut those users now in a show we take care of all of that administration so it takes exactly the same amount of time to deploy any type of these virtual machines plus we only charge per second that these VMS are powered on so what that means is to you is that you have great choice and flexibility in terms of the virtual machines that you can make available to your users because it makes no difference to you which ones you make available so we have families of virtual machines that are optimized for specific workloads so we have sort of cheap and cheerful entry-level virtual machines we have families that are optimized for computer more compute than memory and then memory which is the reverse of that we have families of virtual machines that have GPUs with inside of them families that are optimized for storage inside of each of these families then there are multiple teeth t-shirt sizes so for example the D Series has around about 15 individual sizes within it all of which you could consume inside of your wvd diploma so those are some of our virtual machine families that you can deploy but where can you deploy them well this is back to our map and this is the current 56 your regions that we have across the globe in 21 countries now you can deploy your virtual machines into any of these available as your regions and connect them up into a wvd deployment so if you go back to that previous slide that had the wvd gateway services located on the same map the virtual machines can be deployed into any region and then they connect up into those as your geographies that has that wvd service running within it okay so let's move on to low balancing now at Box wvd has to low balancing mechanisms the first is this thing called breath mode and what that does is it sends users evenly across all of the virtual machines that you have deployed inside of a host pool now a host pool is just a collection of similar virtual machines so you might have a marketing host pool or a host pool that has a certain set of applications now this is nothing new if you've done some Citrix and VMware or RDS for that matter this is the stock standard low balancing mechanism now this is actually not just a load balancing conversation this is actually a pricing conversation or pricing mechanism conversation breath mode is actually aligned with reserved instances that we mentioned earlier reserved instances away pre-commit at a much reduced rate for the set of virtual machines and it's really designed for virtual machines that are powered on 24/7 if you have these virtual machines already powered on then this guarantees the best user experience by distributing those users evenly across the available virtual machines now the reverse of breath mode is a thing called depth mode and that sends users to an individual virtual machine until it is considered full and you get to set the threshold and then it will power on the next virtual machine in that host pool so this is now aligned with pay-as-you-go pricing for the virtual machine where we only charge you per second that they're powered on so the recommendation here is to have those virtual machines powered off for as much of the day as possible to reduce yours your bill and then only send users to the infrastructure that's powered on and until and until the point that it hits that threshold it will then power on The Verge machine and obviously the reverse so you're Roger bill could be as small as possible you okay so moving on to office improvements now our telemetry is telling us that office is one of the number one Suites of applications that's used in a virtual desktop environment out there in the wild however office is also probably the number one cause of problems in applications in a virtual desktop environment so consider things like the OST file for outlook in offline mode or cache mode the onedrive sync client these really didn't work in a VDI environment now that was really because the office development team made the assumption that pretty much everyone out there was using a premium device the desktop with unlimited resources which is absolutely not the case there are hundreds of millions of users using BTI are there to do their day job so again Microsoft listened to the feedback from customers around off di in particularly in particular non-persistent VDI and have made two improvements that affect office the first is a whole slew of improvements in the office code directly taking into consideration VDI users of office is an acquisition and that acquisition was FS logics now up until this point in time many customers out there were buying third-party products to fill the gap that office had in non persistent VDI one of those vendors was FS logics but there are others out there so if an T is another example of this now that we've made the acquisition of FS logics the FS logics capability is now effectively part of WD D so customers no longer need to be purchasing any other products to resolve the problems that have been inherent in office in VDI environments now FS logics has four main capabilities two of which are particularly relevant to VDI environments and those are profile containers and office 365 containers so how then does this container capability work well on to the virtual machines running the VDI workloads is a small file system agent that redirects both reads and writes to the user profile to a that VHD is stored on some storage somewhere within your environments and then when the user logs on that VHD is mounted to whichever VM that they've logged in so it follows the user and not the virtual machine and then this agent will redirect both reads and writes to the users profile to this profile container which is mounted to that VM so into that the HD will be there the users roaming profile so this isn't far far better than using roaming profile technology that's because with roaming profiles you are transmitting hundreds if not thousands of small files which potentially can get corrupted in that process this is block level transfer of that VHD so it's extremely fast and almost completely eliminates the capability of corrupting that profile in that copy process so that's the office container does exactly the same thing for office that the profile container was doing for the user's profile so in this instance anything from office so for example the onedrive sync client is the perfect example is redirected to either the same VHD is the profile container or a separate one which is typically the recommendation any apps that like the onedrive sync client they need anything cached those apps behave in exactly the same way but rather than being written locally they are being written to this VHD and again the same scenario the user can log on to a completely new non persistent VDI tomorrow that office container is mounted to that VM and anything that was written in to that is permanently updated permanently available and constantly hydrated so that covers off things like the app Locker is t file the onedrive sink can't you've mentioned Windows search and anything else from office that requires any kind of caching capability so let's move on to connectivity into the wvd sir so this is the user connection flow on the left-hand side are the clients that we support in the middle is the wvd management plane on the right hand side are the virtual machines hosting your apps and desktop inside of your is your subscription the first thing that actually happens is the user is authenticated against Azure Active Directory as your Active Directory is a modern cloud-based identity provider that supports modern protocols like sam'l a walled open ID connect in this instance the user is authenticated against azure ad yiridi returns a token to the client that client then presents the token to our web access layer at this point they're presented with some icons for the apps or desktops that they've been made available they then launch one of those and they their connection goes via our gateway and is connected into the virtual machine hosting the app and all desktop at this point we have RDP inside of HTTP traffic flowing from the left-hand side all the way through to the verge machine on the right-hand side there is however a new capability with WBE called reverse Connect and what this is is actually there's an agent running on these virtual machines in euros your subscription and they when they start up reach out to our management plane to say I'm ready to accept a connection and that previous slide that process happens and the inbound connection is brokered as you'd imagine by our brokering service and it connects that inbound connection from the client to that outbound connection from the virtual machine so what that means is you do not need any inbound ports opened on these virtual machines the only requirement is for an outbound 443 connection going from these virtual machines into our management plane so we mentioned the clients previously these are the clients that we currently support so we obviously have a Windows client there's an html5 browser client Android as well as Mac OS and iOS in of support for thin clients then currently it's either Windows 10 IOT or a Linux client so we have released a Linux SDK against which the thin client vendors are currently developing their thin oasis now I gel are the only thin client vendor that has already gone ga with their support for wvd the other main vendors are also currently developing against that Linux SDK to provide that support against their thin clients and just one point to be aware of there are some differences in the features that are available per client that you might choose to use so as you would imagine the Windows client has the broadest set of capabilities compared to let's say for example the html5 clients okay so let's move on to understanding the prerequisites that you need in order to run so this is the high-level process the first thing is as always is understanding the users and the applications that you have in scope for any kind of virtual desktop environment wbd doesn't resolve that issue and that is still a requirement of you to understand what it is that you are trying to present to your users the second thing is to understand the authentication model so we currently require as we've seen earlier as your ad as well as Active Directory and we'll go into a bit more detail about the options there for providing Active Directory and then your tenant design so which is your subscription which is your ad tenant are you gonna consume and then your host pool design so are you going to be publishing apps or desktops or both are they going to be pooled or personal desktop so persistent or non persistent the virtual machines that you're going to choose so are you going to have lots of small ones or perhaps a lower number of larger virtual machines your low balancing mechanism each host pool can be one or the other you can change them but any one point in time mate they can only be one you're networking that these virtual machines in your host pool will reside upon and the connectivity so things like DNS and connectivity back to anything required on-premises as well as the profile storage so enabling an SMB file share for the storage of those FS logics Pro and these are the design decisions that you need to make in advance for Windows virtual desktop as we mentioned there is an identity strategy that you need to decide upon we mentioned that you require as your Active Directory but these virtual machines that you log into are still Windows VMs that require to be domain joined that then means means that you need Active Directory and we have a number of choices available to you today you could use as your Active Directory domain services so this is a path based Active Directory service that we operate on your behalf and effectively we provide you with two IP addresses which you can use to point the Active Directory management tools against and you get a slightly cut down version of Active Directory but it's really designed for organizations that don't want to manage Active Directory domain controllers but still have a requirement for directory services so that's one option and it's really for cloud only accounts or identities the second thing is to have a traditional domain controller available so that could either be located inside of as your so placing that on a virtual network but wvd session has to have access to or to have line of sight of a domain controller that's still on premises so either over Express route or a VPN the second thing is to choose where you're going to place your FS logics profiles of which there are a number of choices so you could spin up some file server based storage services so much love storage spaces direct is one example but there are there are other vendors available usual marketplace to offer this kind of service so soft Mars is one example of that you could use as your files today with Azure Active Directory domain services integration we have just gone into preview for Active Directory Integration but it's not there yet but that will be coming in the next few months or you could use another service as your NetApp files so this is a fully Microsoft own service running net app technology under the hood so that's a again another great service for hosting an SMB file share upon which you can place your FS projects profiles and then you also need to make sure that you have all of the credentials that are required in order to deploy an end-to-end wvd deployment so that's obviously an azure subscription admin account and as your Active Directory global admin account and an Active Directory have an account for doing the domain join for the session hosts to your Active Directory and then a wvd tenon admin so this is a user account that does your wvd specific administration and these are the prerequisites again for the user requirements in in a little bit more detail so for wbd we require and as your subscription with a user account that has at least contributor access to either a resource group or the entire azores your subscription we need to have an as your Active Directory user account that has global admin and this is to consent that the wvd service can consume your identities from your is your Active Directory we also require as your ad connect that's syncing user accounts from your Active Directory wherever that might be up into the azure active directory that you're using and then optionally if you did want to do Federation you can use a DFS or some other third-party Federation service to be redirecting those authentication requests back to an on-premises domain controller we also as mentioned require Active Directory so we have to have that line of sight of a domain controller and we need to have an account that has at least domain join permissions so that we can join those virtual machines that are deployed in a wvd host pool into your Active Directory and then finally although it is optional is connectivity back to on-premises so there's two options here Express route which is our private dedicated low latency connectivity back to on-premises or a site-to-site VPN who's where those accounts are required so the wvd admin is just administering the wvd tenant the as your subscription admin just has permissions over your Azure subscription to deploy infrastructure so virtual machines virtual networks for example your as your ad global admin account is just has permissions over your as your ad and is only required to consent the wvd service to consume your is your ad as well as the Active Directory have been so this is just having permissions over your active direction so deploying wvd comes in for relatively simple steps the first is to grant ad consent so we are saying that you're the WBT service has the ability to read identities inside of your as your ad in order to authenticate them onto the service we then need to assign a tenant creator so this is just an azure ad user account that has the capability to create a tenant which is then used by PowerShell to go and create a tenant inside of the wvd service and then finally from the azure marketplace is the capability to go and deploy a host pool so this will actually deploy the virtual machines that will reside upon your virtual network so let's now move on and discuss partners DVD management service has a full REST API against which partners can develop to add their value on top of a standard wvd deployment and we have many partners in this space too many to mention here but our long-standing partners of Citrix and VMware are there as well as some smaller point product partners so people like Alger hi Joe we've mentioned NetApp ThinPrint who can provide advanced printing capabilities on top of wvd now every customer I go to speak to asks me are you competing against citrix or are you competing against VMware the answer to that question is a clear no we are not competing as either Citrix or VMware now Citrix have a protocol Citrix Cloud that in as well as VMware are the only vendors who are enabled to provide Windows 10 multi session via their cloud services and this high-level architecture is the Citrix Cloud high-level architecture and what you will see is very similar to the wvd architecture so on the left hand side you have all of the Citrix specific technology so workspace the next scalar service you also have in the middle the is your subscription of the customer where they go and deploy all of their virtual machines including the wvd entitlement that enables them to run Windows 10 multi session and obviously that's all running on top of our I has serviced it asked well what value does Citrix add well the value that they have added over the last 30 or so years continues and that paradigm will not change with wvd so if there's anything that you see on this list that you or your customer requires and cannot live without from Citrix our recommendation is to continue with Citrix by virtue of Citrix cloud as well as taking advantage of the wvd services that you're also entitled to consume and exactly the same way that also applies to VMware with horizon cloud on Azure now this isn't available yet is currently in preview and it's due to go ga in March twenty twenty but again if you have any requirement for horizon type capabilities than our recommendation is to stick with horizon cloud in conjunction with agile and WV D so let's move on to our final section the wvd areas current capabilities that are in preview or will be released very soon and then a longer-term roadmap for wvd of which there is a long list of capabilities and features that will arrive this is a non exhaustive list now some of these new capabilities we mentioned eye gel have support for thin clients today so if you did need thin client support would WT go and speak to a gel because they have already announced support for wvd but other thin client vendors are actively developing against our linux sdk to provide that support natively in their thin oasis so look out for announcements from other thin client vendors we also have a public preview of your files support for Active Directory Integration what this enables customers to do is apply NTFS Ackles across and as your files SMB file share location what that then opens is the capability to have user profiles stored on as your files so it's a great location for storing FS logics user profiles as well as for storing departmental file shares we are also currently developing teams optimizations natively into the team's client and what this will do is it will redirect voice and video calls from wvd down to the local device which will then established a web RTC peer-to-peer connection with the recipient rather than hair pinning that up and down to Azure and then obviously the screen refreshes of that call are then presented back into the wvd session so there is a team's tap program that customers can sign up to see that capability we also have some improvements in the admin experience for wvd what that means is support inside of the azure portal natively for managing a wvd deployment as well as a preview you can sign up for the MS IX app attach so this is the combination of two things MSI X at packaging which is an existing packaging format in conjunction with app attached which is an efficient way of attaching these MSI X to a wvd session and then on the longer-term wvd roadmap we have a number of items so we're currently under development but we'll take some time is is your ad only support so what this will provide is the capability of removing the requirement for Active Directory so you'll be able to sign into the wvd service using user ad credentials as well as sign-on to the virtual machines we will not remove the support for ad so some customers like the capability of having their domain controllers doing authentication so we will provide customers with the choice of both of those services we will also have Intune support in the in the future for managing the wvd session host from incheon as well as supporting UDP so today as tcp only UDP support is coming we also are under development for an event based scaling service so currently today we have an as your logic app which provides some scaling based upon calendar events as well as user load a much more rich robust scaling service is currently under development and will be released soon as well as a feature that we're referring to as RDP short path now what this does is it enables customers to connect to their session hosted or across Express route directly so the user connection does not go via the management plane but rather goes directly to that virtual machine so that has the capability of significantly reducing latency to those virtual machines the other thing to bear in mind and to take away in terms of roadmap is that wvd is now a Azure service and what that means is that some of the capabilities that pre-exists in in agile or new capabilities that come to Azure that have some type of support or benefit for a virtual desktop will then also become available so not to say that this is on the roadmap but things like our machine learning service also our IOT hub service which is taking and managing events from billions of IOT devices out there across the planet this means that as you're is aware of IOT events so things like smart buildings and smart security barriers at the front of buildings that allow users to come into the building if as you're is aware of those events then we could potentially take advantage of that in our scaling service the point here is that as your is a rich and wide platform that has a plethora of services many of which have some kind of impact on a virtual desktop so the future is now lot no longer as we mentioned depend upon Windows Server but rather on a jewel and the broad set of capabilities that is your can bring in the future to a virtual desktop and this is just a sneak peek at these your portal integration if you've been into a job before you will recognize the user experience here so it's nothing new if you've done as you're before but rather than managing this via PowerShell you can now manage your wvd deployment natively inside the usual portal and so finalists have a look at msi expert at so currently with a physical workstation and for some virtual machines this might be true all of the components required to make up a user environment are very closely linked or coupled together so the apps to the operating system the user profiles of both the apps and the operating system so not an ideal solution particularly for non-persistent B now what FS logics has done via the user profile is to be able to completely and utterly separate the user profile from the operating system enabling customers to have VDI this effectively cattle and users to connect into any virtual machine in a user profile is currently up to date but what about the applications what can we do well that's exactly where MSI X and pattach comes in so MSO except attach is actually the combination of two things MSI X which is a pre-existing packaging format in conjunction with app attached which is a new capability of presenting those at to wvd session hosts now it's not actually FS logics capability here but it is doing this in the very similar way to how FS logics presents the user profile and it does that by expanding an MSI X up into a VHD that VHD is then mounted on demand to the virtual machine that the users logged into and the application is effectively registered to the operating system at that point the app appears to the OS and to the user as if it is locally installed and they can consume the app as if it were as soon as that PhD is deregistered or dismounted from that virtual machine there is no remnant whatsoever of the application so it has absolutely no impact on that virtual machine so this really then enables that complete separation of both the user profile as well as applications from the virtual machine the virtual machines end up just being a sprawl of cattle that you really don't care too much about because you are managing the users persona as well as the users applications completely separately from those virtual machines so it's a very elegant way of presenting apps to virtual machines in particularly into wvd session hosts and will become the standard recommendation for how we deploy applications and make them available to users in a wvd deployment you so let's move on to our final section which is licensing for wvd so this might be slightly boring for our technical folks but it is important particularly for large enterprises who are doing virtual desktop at scale for whom this can become a very expensive estate in their environment so what can happen with wvd is is some significant cost reductions for an overall wvd deployment for many thousands of users now wvd is not actually licensed itself so you can't go and buy a license to use wvd it's actually licensed via other products and it may well be that you already own the licenses that entitle you to use wvd so I'm not gonna list them all but you can see the licenses that are listed down there if you have for example Microsoft 365 III or above that means you are already eligible to be running Windows virtual desktop and in particular running our client os's within wvd so Windows 10 as well as Windows 7 if you do choose to deploy windows serve with RDS there is still a requirement for a cow for that workload but that is not applicable if you are deploying Windows 10 multi session which just as a reminder enables a similar type of scalability that's available from RDS but the main point here to take away is that you are eligible to use wvd by virtue of a license that you probably already own so that's the licensing however there will be some as your usage charges associated with the infrastructure that you deploy so for example if you deploy a hundred virtual machines then your as your bill is going to reflect that now this opens up the opportunity for seeing some cost savings by taking advantage of things like reserved instances this is the capability to pre commit for one or three years for a set of virtual machines at a significantly reduced rate compared to pay-as-you-go so that can be up to 70% cheaper using reserved instances over pairs you go or you can consider going pay-as-you-go and then having the capability of powering these virtual machines off when they're not in use so there are tools inside a visual and some of our partner solutions that enable you to automate the powering off and obviously our recommendation is to have these VMs powered off for as long as possible so that your Azure bill would also reflect that ok so let's move on to the benefits of wvd in particular the cost savings and the efficiencies that are now possible now if anybody's seen the shared services model which is applicable to cloud workloads you will have seen the comparison between what we've used to do on-premises versus I as so infrastructure as a service compared to past platform as a service compared to software as a service so this is a perfect example of that working in the flesh on the left-hand side is the traditional RDS deployment with all of the individual components the customers had to go and deploy in order to present apps and desktops and the data associated with those to their user estate whereas wvd as you can see here Microsoft is taking away the requirement for the customers to manage a whole chunk of that undifferentiated heavy lifting that customers or the all customers have to do in order to get their users consuming the service so what that means is there are significant cost benefits of using wve and they really fall into three main areas the infrastructure the licensing and the labor costs associated with the management of a traditional RDS deployment so the first cost saving in our infrastructure space is really this Windows 10 experience but coming at a multi-session cost so as we've seen before Windows 10 up until this point has been single session only so one virtual machine to one user Windows 10 multi session enables us to have multiple users all locked on to one virtual machine now that might emit slightly larger but it's the same scalability that we've always had with RDS now applied to Windows 10 now there will be significant cost savings that can be achieved here by instead of having lots of smaller virtual machines having far fewer slightly larger virtual machines to support the same number of users now in our example here which is a slightly generic example we are suggesting that you can get up to 85 percent discount or savings I should say compared to running this R on a traditional Windows 10 single session VM on premises now again your mileage they may vary but the principle stacks up that you will see cost savings by virtue of consuming Windows 10 multi session over single session so the second infrastructure advantage here that's made available only by Azure is that customers no longer need to deploy their infrastructure for the peak workload so anything between this red line and the blue line is effectively wasted infrastructure because it's not being consumed by your user estate so one of the benefits of running wvd on Azure is that you can auto provision infrastructure based upon actual user demand so you're no longer building for the peak usage and having any wasted infrastructure that's not being consumed so your infrastructure can follow your actual user patterns what you can also do is combine both pairs you go which would probably be the blue line in conjunction with the reserved instances so users or virtual machines that you know need to be powered on pretty much 24/7 and the combination of both of these again will enable you to achieve some cost savings again your your mileage they may vary but the principle stacks up again that if you are provisioning only for the actual usage rather than the peak demand you will again be able to achieve those cost savings so the next cost benefit is applicable to wvd is the fact that the session host VMs so these are the MS that are actually hosting your desktop or your application are only charged at the Linux rates or what we refer to as the base compute rate so VMs inside of is you'll have two prices the windows price and the Linux price and that cost difference can be around fifty percent per virtual machine now by virtue of the licensing that you require in order to run wvd you've effectively paid for Windows licenses so these session host VMs are not charged at the windows rate but rather at that Linux rate so that enables you to see some significant cost savings once again compared to running these standard Windows virtual machines now that's only applicable to the virtue of the wvd specific virtual machines it's not applicable to any associated VMs that you might run for potentially hosting a file server share or any license servers or any other service for that matter it's only applicable to those wvd session host VMs so the next licensing saving that you can achieve with wvd is again a feature of Windows 10 multi session so as we mentioned earlier if you are deploying RDS so Windows Server with RDS there is still a requirement for a cow if you're deploying Windows 10 multi session there is no requirement for a cow and so what that absolutely means is that you will be saving $17 per user per month by deploying Windows 10 multi session over deploying Windows Server RDS at the beginning we also mentioned Windows 7 which also receives extended security updates until 2023 what customers can achieve is the cost benefit of not having to pay for those extended security updates if they have on-premises Windows 7 that they also want to receive these security updates for so again over those three years customers can see between 25 to $20 savings per device per year so the final area of cost savings is the fact that wvd is a management service that's operated by Microsoft so no longer do your IT admins need to be managing multiple different services on lots of virtual machines within your datacenter taking up time and obviously generating costs wvd as we've mentioned is a management service that's included in licenses that you already own so you can now save the time and the cost associated with all of that management for all of that infrastructure allowing your IT m is to concentrate on providing more value back to your user estate and this is just a simple generic pricing example for a hundred users using wvd which we've split into sort of the industry standard user personas of task knowledge and professional worker as well as power workers who are really users that require a GPU inside of the virtual machine for Grasset graphics intensive applications so we are just using our sort of standard recommended virtual machine of a d8 s v3 and what you can see on the final right hand side column is the estimated cost for the compute and storage associated with those 100 users in each of these categories and what you can see there is it's roughly 3 pounds 5400 tasks users going up to 6 pounds 70 for professional workers and then a little bit of a jump up to 20 pounds for those power workers but what you can see is that in most cases this is a very cost-effective solution for running users across wvd ok so that's brought me to the end of my session so thanks for sticking with me hopefully you found it interesting and have learned something about WD if you've got any questions feel free to reach out to me you can see my email address there you can also follow me on Twitter and LinkedIn and I've also got my website there where I post a number of blog articles about interesting things coming from wvd including some content which I upload to my github as you can see there so once again thanks very much and speak soon
