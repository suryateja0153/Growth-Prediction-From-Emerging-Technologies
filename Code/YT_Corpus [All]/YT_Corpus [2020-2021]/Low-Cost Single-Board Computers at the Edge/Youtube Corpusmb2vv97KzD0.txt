 it's okay still not Faris oh hi I'm KK in today I am going to try to replace the battery in a retina MacBook Pro so this repair according to I fix it is one of the most difficult repairs because the battery is really glued on to the lower case but because I work at I fix it I have lots of access to engineers so yesterday I gave them a call and they gave me a couple of tips and tricks before I got started hey Jeff okay so I'm actually going to try well no I'm not going to try I'm going to replace the battery in a 13-inch retina MacBook Pro looking through the guide got a little bit intimidated and thought I have engineers I can call and I'm very lucky so just wanted to give you a call and see if you had any tips or tricks for me we scored this laptop of 1 out of 10 on our ability scale you're in for a challenge right off the bat I want to say this is a difficult guide but it's mostly tedious I would just tell you don't rush it what's the worst thing that could happen I would recommend discharging the MacBook as much as you can before you start the repair be careful that you don't pry against the motherboard or the little trackpad control board I like to slip a piece of tinfoil in underneath to protect the screen because that is directly underneath everything and so if you go too crazy with the adhesive remover you can get some of it on the screen do you recommend like having a bucket of sand yes I would definitely recommend having a bucket of sand or some kind of disaster prep scenario we have a link at the top of the guide for what to do with a swarm battery they can be dangerous so if it looks funky if it looks swollen or sweaty read the precautions that we've laid out and then decide if you want to proceed to prepare well thanks Jeff I think I have everything you need just needed a little bit of confidence from the friends you got this I'm gonna get started so I have the iFixit guide here and I have the kit first thing we gotta do according to the guide is remove the lower case which is secured to the upper case most of these screws are the same length the two middle screws in the middle of the MacBook those are actually a different length so you're going to want to keep them in order I have my magnetic mat here so I can write everything down and make sure everything stays in the same place Oh connected with clips hope I didn't break anything but I'm pretty sure that is how it's supposed to go step one and almost any repair is to disconnect the battery battery connector is over here you always want to go slow but I definitely don't put yeah that popped right out so I have kind of bent it back so that no power can circulate through the machine now I am going to remove the right speaker so I am going to remove the two Torx screws that are securing the logic board and two so far so good almost just too simple the next thing I want to do is the flat edge of the spudger to pop up the i/o board off its socket so there is a caution sign here it says be careful only to pry up the i/o board cable not on the socket itself and if you do you can risk damaging your logic board but if I do damage the logic board at least we know Luis Rossman [Music] so next thing I'm going to do is now that I have the i/o board cable out of the way I can disconnect the right speaker cable from the connector I'm gonna do that now there we go so now I am going to carefully peel the right speaker cable off of the upper case which is not hard to do really you're just trying to give yourself more room to be able to take out the battery there are a lot of screws securing the speaker to the upper case so I guess we're going to remove some screws it was the first one second one and so with those screws out of the way I can now lift the right speaker from the cable and pull it free from the case okay so now we've got to do the same thing on the right side this one seems oh there we go there's the second one there it is so the next step is popping the trackpad connector straight up out of its socket so that is this guy here and feel like a pro disconnecting connectors now that came right out alright so we're gonna lift this trackback cable up to be able to make room for the battery to come out and it's fill up fairly easily not resisting at the very end of the connector there is a zip connector that I need to disconnect so I have to open the bracket on the ZIF connector oh there we go well most of the disassembly is moving and shaking so I'm on step 22 of the guide and it's asking me to put aluminum foil between the display and the keyboard so in the case that the adhesive remover falls into the wrong places the foil is hopefully going to protect my display Oh open that a little bit all right just please work oh the next thing you need to do I guess this is getting more and more dangerous I need to put on glasses and safety gloves alright so this is I guess where the real fun begins so I have my iFixit adhesive remover one of the tips I got from Taylor and Jeff or just go slow and be patient and so I'm reading that you actually have like two times as much adhesive remover in this bottle than you need so just keep that in mind when you are putting it into the battery alright so Jeff and Taylor also told me to start on the outsides of the battery the trackpad is in the center of the battery and you can do some damage there so you just want to be extra careful as you're prying things out so starting with the right I don't know why it feels so strange to put liquid in a battery but here we go okay [Music] so let's see if that little amount of adhesive did it I mean I should probably wait a little bit longer but I definitely think that I need a little bit more adhesive remover so here we go all right so try to with the card promising oh okay right one is out I'm about 30 minutes into this repair and I still only have one battery sellout which feels crazy to me we are going to repeat this process on the next cell so we did the very right cell and you can see that up and now we're gonna do one right next to it I wish the guide told me where to apply the adhesive remover it just says apply a small amount under the battery there's lots of places to choose from top side bottom wish I knew where but I'm just gonna go on the side because that feels right when I replace the battery in my 2012 MacBook Pro it literally took ten minutes I like to think of batteries as oil changes like you're gonna need to replace it if you want to keep your device running and when you do things like completely blew it down to the case this is an awful experience it's gonna go in with the card again same tactic [Music] yep nope that's not working so I guess I will continue to add adhesive remover and maybe tilt it a little bit like I hope that's okay in my mind the adhesive is stuck under there so you want to use a little too easy get it in there guide doesn't say to do this let's hope I'm not screwing anything up there's just a lot of gross adhesive right here and you can see there's still a lot of residue left on the case as well okay let's see if we are getting anywhere more louver the card is sliding in more ah huzzah throw my card under there and outside one so here hide some amount of adhesive remover I think the guide says 45 minutes to two hours and I really think that probably depends on this part right here the adhesive but it's no okay more adhesive remover trying again ah okay I really really want to keep prying pretty hard but I have Jeff in my mind just telling me you shouldn't ever force anything in repair especially a battery so I guess I will put a teensy bit more adhesive remover in oh sorry boxes okay oh geez okay all right so now I have just the middle cell which I have been warned is that it scariest I guess Taylor and Jeff both told me to be really careful with crying because there's a lot of components around and then this is where they told me to potentially elevate my matchbook I have a pair of speakers so I'm just gonna look that still waiting for the adhesive remover to do its thing and then I'm going to take this right card and then continue to pry from the right versus prying from the down here where I can potentially damage that board all right so now comes apparently the hardest part of this repair and it is pulling out this middle battery both Jeff and Taylor warned me to be very careful with the trackpad and so here I go I'm gonna pry from side ish up here you're getting there not quickly but okay I'm feeling a little bit defeated on the right side so maybe the left side will be more productive you shouldn't be laughing this much okay underneath these batteries is a bunch of sticky gunk and that is what we are fighting with and so that's why it takes so long for the adhesive remover to work there's nothing technically difficult about it which is what Jeff and Taylor said which is why they are our teardown engineers it's just annoying like getting this adhesive up it's just tedious and time-consuming and you just don't want to go too fast oh my gosh so close the card is under ah okay um I got it this is the money shot oh yeah thing is just completely coated in a lot of adhesive so with the battery out I'm going to start getting off the rest of this gunky adhesive before I put my new battery in guide says you can just start with your fingers all right I'm still battling the last of the adhesive I'm fairly close to being done here just scraping it up now I think we are ready to put the new battery back in I'm going to take off my gloves because I think I'm allowed to do that or I want to do that because I do though there is plastic if you bought the i6a kit you can see that the adhesive is already on the battery which is nice I started doing that with iPhones as well which makes your pair a lot easier doing this super gracefully all right so that screw is in and it should just push right in there putting the speaker back in just doing this whole thing in Reverse there we go and then I'm gonna go ahead and tighten those those up all right and that's just pressed right in there luckily my battery isn't adhered too far down yet so I still have a little bit of room to play with so I can snap this guy in so lay him back down and then we got one more so you go right here so gonna replace the bracket on the i/o board I'm gonna put the battery back in [Music] so let us get this tape back on all right so I am going to lift this up and see how much adhesive remover got on the foil and seemingly none soda positive powering it on now hopefully it will recognize it and if it does I have a beer here waiting for me it turned on good sign alright so all done if you've got a hard repair that you want to see me try go ahead and drop that into the comments and I'll see you next time [Music] [Music]
