 the wacom one is welcomes most affordable display tablet to date I'm Aaron Rutten and today I'm going to be reviewing the Wacom one from a digital artist perspective quick disclaimer this is not a sponsored video but Wacom did send me this tablet unconditionally to review as I please as always all opinions in this video are my own now if the name welcome one sounds familiar you're not the only one see what I did there there's also one by Wacom which is an on display tablet potentially adding some confusion for those of you who are searching for these devices online repeating names for multiple products seems to happen a lot at Wacom and although it's confusing my guess is that perhaps there has to be some benefit to doing it this way personally I would have called it Wacom - but I digress in 2019 Wacom released the Cintiq 16 which was a more budget-friendly display tablet but now in 2020 we see the price being lowered even more for a Wacom quality display tablet this is great news for artists who really want to draw directly onto a screen but don't have a whole lot of money to invest in the professional level features that often accompany display tablets the Wacom one is lean and mean it has the essentials you need to make digital art and not much else so let's dive into this device and take a look at some of the specs I'll also do some painting on this device so you can see how it performs the screen measures 11.6 inches wide by 6.5 inches tall its 13.3 inches diagonally the screen resolution is 1920 by 1080 and the color gamut is 72% of NTSC which is a little over 70% a dhobi RGB around 93 percent or so of srgb so it's not the best screen in terms of clarity or color accuracy but it will do the trick the Wacom one is using an a hva display with a Wacom EMR digitizer like you might see in a tablet like the Samsung Galaxy Note there is no touch capability I wouldn't even bother trying and there is a matte anti-glare film applied to the tablet the film is applied very well without any bubbles or edges peeling off one really cool feature is that there's virtually no bezel to interrupt your pen if you make a stroke that goes off of the active area the bezel will catch your pen slightly at the very edge of the tablet but there's a pretty decent buffer zone before your pen hits that edge this bezel design is a lot closer to the pros antiques in terms of bezel width the bezel design of the Wacom one is much closer to the Cintiq Pro models which I like now let's discuss the pen the pen has over 4,000 pressure levels which is more than adequate for drawing and painting the pen resolution is two thousand five hundred and forty LPI pen tilt is supported which is great you can use pen tilt to change the angle of your brush dab or to shade with the side of your pencil welcomes pen does not require a battery or charging and it performs much better than non Wacom pens even with the more budget minded tablets Wacom is offering you're still getting a top-of-the-line pen experience the pen is lighter and smaller than the pro pens and similar in look and feel to the one that comes with the Intuos the pen has only one button rather than two and it does not have an eraser there are three spare nibs hiding behind the legs as far as using other pens on the Wacom one the Wacom one does not support other Wacom pens like the art pen or the pro pen - but it does support other types of EMR pens I have this Stadler Norris digital pen which looks a lot like a pencil and it works great on the Wacom one I can even vary the width of my line by pressing harder or lighter there are a few other pens that are supported and more pen brands will be added in the future now if I do some quick line tests the line quality is great it's very smooth there's no significant lime jitter even if I'm doing diagonal lines there's virtually no parallax or offset to the cursor the line tests with a Stadler pencil are great too I notice that the Stadler pencil grips the surface more I prefer the feel of the Wacom pen but the Stadler pencil could be a nice option perhaps for note-taking or sketching having a button on the pen is definitely useful too now let's move on to discuss the build quality of the Wacom One the device itself is 8.9 inches by 14.1 inches with a thickness of 0.6 inches it's very lightweight at only 2.2 pounds the stand is built into the tablet there are two legs that fold out to bring the tablet to an angle of 19 degrees the legs are surrounded by a rubber grip and bottom edges of the tablet have a rubber grip as well this means that whether the legs are extended or the tablet is lying flat it won't slide around when you draw on it there are no external Express keys on the Wacom one but you can get the optional Express key remote if you like there's a nice fabric pen holder in the top center you just slide your pen in and out of this as far as the screen temperature I didn't notice any warmth the edges and the back of the tablet or kind of a off-white color the Wacom one comes with a one-year warranty and I'd say the build quality feels great the tablet does not flex much when you're bending it and the edges are smooth and rounded overall I'd say the thickness is closer to the Intuos Pro or the n2 of 2019 and I can't help but notice that the Wacom one is kind of similar in design to the XP pen 15.6 pro but without the external buttons now let's discuss compatibility the Wacom one requires an HDMI video connection and a standard USB a port for the data connection now the USB C USB a HDMI and power are all combined into an X cable the power end of the connector is a USB a connection which plugs into this AC power adapter and this adapter can be converted for different outlet types and then the USBC cable connects to the tablet the Wacom one is compatible with PC and Mac and it requires Windows 7 or later or Mac OS 10 point 13 or later and just for clarity there is not a built in computer in the Wacom one it must be connected to a Windows Mac or a compatible Android device such as the Samsung Galaxy S 8s 10 plus and some of the Samsung Galaxy Notes as well as some other types of phones now in order to connect the Wacom one to a compatible Android device you're going to need either Walken's adapter which is not included or a USB C mini hub once you've connected the Wacom one to your Android device you can open the Samsung desktop if you're using a Samsung device which expands to fill the active area of the tablet and you can draw just like you could on a desktop computer it's not like the Intuos Android that I reviewed recently we're only part of the tablet can be drawn on and it only works as a mouse cursor on your phone this here is legit my Samsung devices are not on the list of compatible devices so unfortunately I'm not able to try it myself but from what I've seen it looks really cool a phone or tablet could legitimately replace your desktop or laptop workstation for creating basic digital art now let's discuss installation and software installation was very easy to setup all I needed to do was plug the tablet in and install the driver and it worked I didn't have any driver issues I can use the Wacom control panel to customize the pen button for each app individually or globally for all apps and there's lots of other options you can tinker with the Wacom one also comes with some bundled software the software is only available for Windows 10 there's bamboo paper which is a note-taking app there's clip studio paint Pro which offers you a free license for up to six months this is a great digital drawing and painting application you can also get Adobe Premiere rush which is kind of a simplified video editing application this is very useful for doing video editing on the go if you're doing vlogs and travel videos and things like that Adobe fresco is coming soon they're offering a six month license but as of the making of this video it's not available quite yet and even if you don't like that bundled software you can get lots of great free alternatives such as credit so what can you do with the Wacom one you can take notes you can edit photos you can edit videos you could of course do some light drawing and painting on this device you could do graphic design and more a couple of features that I think are cool is that this tablet can be powered by a portable battery bank or a desktop or laptop via USB you'll of course need two USB ports one for data and one for power but it's neat to see that you can use this thing without having to plug it into a wall you can also use the Wacom one as a portable monitor through HDMI so for example you might want to use a monitor to monitor your video recordings or your photography so who is the Wacom one for the Wacom one is a great starter tablet for beginners or younger artists with smaller hands who may also want to move their tablet between rooms or maybe even take it to school Android compatibility means the Wacom one might even be a good tablet for photographers who shoot on their phones to do some editing on the go and with the bundled premiere rush software vloggers can even edit their videos and view them on a larger screen without having to lug around a laptop best of all premiere rush syncs with the desktop through the cloud it also feels great for note-taking if you wanted to create video tutorials where you write out math equations you could do that with the Wacom one if you're a college student you can connect it to your phone and use it to take notes during lectures and I have to say handwriting on the wall come one felt really natural while using the Stadler pencil and now for some comparisons should you get the Wacom one or the Cintiq 16 which is a bit more expensive the Cintiq 16 offers a better pen it has a better display that's a bit brighter it's drawing area is of course a bit larger it has an option for an attachable and adjustable stand and the Cintiq 16 is compatible with the art pen which can sense rotation and other types of Wacom pens however the Wacom one is definitely thinner lighter and more portable especially if you're planning to work primarily on a compatible phone or tablet the Cintiq 16 with the stand attached can be quite bulky the Wacom one is also a more affordable alternative to the intuos pro if you don't mind trading some of the pro level features for a display that you can draw directly onto and now for the price the Wacom one sells for 399 dollars you can purchase the Wacom one using the affiliate link in the description of this video so let's talk about some pros and cons the pros of the Wacom 1 are that it's a very low-profile and lightweight device it comes with a limited bundled software the Wacom One offers excellent pen quality that's only exceeded by Wacom Pro pens the Wacom one supports other types of EMR pens which is great and it supports some Android devices and now for the cons the Wacom 1 does not include the adapter to connect it to an Android device but you may not need it so I guess it does keep the cost down the Wacom one only supports certain Android devices I was excited to try this at first but my device is not supported so I can't the Wacom one does not have any Express keys and it does not support touch so that means you're going to have to lug around a keyboard if you're planning on using this with a phone or tablet only concerning the stand 19 degrees is not the most comfortable angle to draw at and there's no way to adjust the angle to a more vertical orientation and in my last gripe is that the white color on the bottom of the tablet and the edges could collect stains over time it could be dirt from your hand or it could be grime that's on your desk and now for my conclusion 2020 seems like it's going to be the year that smartphones give desktop computers a run for their money in terms of being capable digital art workstations of course phone hardware is nowhere near professional level but for artists who are new to digital art a phone is now a legit tool for making art I'm also happy to see Wacom offering an even more affordable display tablet because I believe non display tablets are on their way out it feels so much better to see what you're drawing underneath your pen and I'm glad the Wacom one puts that experience within the reach of more artists now I know there's going to be common saying that there are welcome alternatives that offer more for the same price I feel like I'm beating a dead horse here but I urge you to check out my comparison video of the XP pen artist 15.6 pro 2 a Wacom tablet so you can get a feel for what the real differences are because tablets are more than just specs on a website for example you certainly can get a pen with higher pressure levels but if the pen doesn't respond to light pressure then what's the point or you might get lines that are always wavy or have unexpected tapering when you choose a Wacom alternative so please be digital art smart and watch some reviews before you buy a tablet and don't go off of specs alone and for all you ipad bros feel free to leave your comments on my review of the mobile studio pro 16 because the Wacom one is not a tablet computer if this was your first time on this channel check out some of my other drawing tablet reviews thanks for watching and I'll see you next time you
