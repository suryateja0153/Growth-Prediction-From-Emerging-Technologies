 Welcome to Designed to the Nines I'm NataLee Callahan and if this is the first time we're meeting welcome to my channel for today's episode I have compiled a macdaddy episode of all of my best spring and Easter DIYs so get comfortable... relax and let's get designing and DIYing 'to the Nines'! I've got five way-cool dirt-cheap Easter / Spring DIYs for you this is a new series that I've started where the goal is to have a very designer looking decor piece that's around ten dollars or less but has a high-end finish and if you watched last month's episode the very first project I did was this really awesome love sign with the metallic gold I just loved this piece it was definitely one of my favorites now at the time I said to hang on to this because there was a back side and for our first DIY we are going to be doing happy Easter now you could do happy spring if you don't celebrate Easter it's totally cool we celebrate Easter in my house so we are gonna be doing Easter now even though I'm going to be using a Cricut machine to complete my project for those of you who do not own a Cricut machine I have not forgot you I've got a printable all ready to go that you can use to transfer this exact image onto your wood round so whether you have a machine or not you can do this project now if you stick with me to the very end I'm gonna promise you three things one you're gonna have a lot of fun or at least I hope you will along the way number two I'm saving my favorite project till the end and three all the way through I've got several free things for you even up to the end so you're gonna want to stay tuned so you don't miss out on I thing... so let's get started I start out by painting the back of the round in a concoction of blue paint that I stirred up myself and didn't end up liking it so once it dried I painted it in Waverly chalk paint in the color pool now we're gonna go into Cricut design studio and we're just gonna put in Happy Easter now the font that I am using is called nocturnal and you can download that for free at dafont.com and then you can have it on your computer and then Cricut design studio will pick up that font and you can use it in there so that's really good so then once we've got our sign situated how we want we just go in and we get our vinyl ready now I picked up this gold vinyl and some of you might just decide to cut the vinyl and call it a day but I really am in love with this metallic pure gold by folk art I really like the way it looks so I'm not gonna be using vinyl today and this is removable even though it's like almost the same color it's kind of funny it's very close but this is just not as warm the vinyl is not as warm so we're gonna be using this as a stencil but I know that I'm gonna get comments on why didn't you just go ahead and use the vinyl well because it doesn't match the gold that's already on there and I really love the warmth of this this gold and so we're gonna go ahead and just use that paint today if you don't have a Cricut here's the process take the printable I provided in the description box below and lay it on your round place graphite paper underneath and trace the lettering it will transfer onto the wood then you just hand paint it in the gold color if you are using a vinyl cutter now it's time to apply your stencil and then we are going to do a layer of the original blue color over the stencil now this is the same technique I use to stripe my walls and the reason I do this is when it bleeds it bleeds the original color and inevitably most things bleed especially if there's any kind of texture at all so this is just a way to avoid some of the bleeding and once that blue color is dried we'll go over and do two coats of our gold to just get a really nice pure gold color and then when that's dried all we need to do is pull up the vinyl stencil and it is done I am super happy with how this turned out this Easter sign and if you look at this we've got love we've got Easter so we've got two for one you can't beat that because now it makes this wood round cost go in half so originally it costs six dollars for this wood round and by doing it for two holidays that saves you a bunch of money dual purpose love it I did blue because it kind of coordinates with all the other colors that I've got going on but you can really do any pastel color that you want alright so for my next DIY we're calling a mini Easter cloche I actually have a couple of different ways that I'm gonna go about this so you're gonna have a couple of different options here so just hang with me and I'm gonna explain it all almost all of these items I have gotten from the Dollar Tree and now I'm not a big Dollar Tree crafter but if I can make it look pretty darn good then I'll go with that so here's what I've got planned so I came across these candlesticks at the Dollar Tree and I thought that they were awesome I loved the way they look they're pretty beefy for a Dollar Tree candlestick so I snatched up like five of them and then I got like three and white because I haven't seen these a whole ton in the stores and so I wanted to make sure I stocked up so hopefully you can find these in your store you can also find similar stands to this in the unfinished wood section at Michael's with a 40% off coupon it will still be extremely affordable maybe a couple of bucks so I've used those ones before as well so then I found this glass it was curvy and not super flat on the bottom flipping that over it fits perfectly into our candlestick and there you have a mini cloche but I'm not going to leave it alone like that but you could also put it in the bottom down and it also makes a beautiful hurricane so there's that option as well now making the cloche there's usually some kind of knob or handle and not always but usually there's some kind of decorative knob on top well you could go and use a cabinet hardware pull if you're a perfume lover like myself ... I've kind of whittled it down to like one favorite perfume that I wear most of the time and that's Princess by Vera Wang I really love that one usually the perfumes come with really pretty bottle toppers and so instead of using a cabinet knob this time I have this left over from one of my perfume bottles so that means it's free and we're upcycling it from our perfume bottle and I thought we could just glue this to the top of our cloche like so and how pretty is that really and it's so high-end looking and you would never tell that these things are from the Dollar Tree then I went on for a mini bunny at the Dollar Tree as they have these little kid ceramic painting kits I thought that the bunny was really cute now we're gonna have to take off the topper very carefully out of this bunny and you could just leave it white and do something with it just like this and that would be really cute but I have the tiniest little bit of cement spray paint left over from a project last fall and I thought it would be kind of fun to give it a cement look and then we might go back on top and add in a little bit more white and we'll just have to play around with it but I thought it would be fun to make our little bunny stone like then we're gonna just put in a little bed of moss that we got from the Dollar Tree and we're gonna just put some of that in the bottom of our candle stick and then we'll set our bunny on top of it we might even add a little greenery and other things to make it feel a little spring-like maybe a few little flowers and then we'll put our cloche top on and there you have it now again you could do this entire process doing it with the bottom down and just the hurricane and do everything else exactly the same and that would be super cute I'm actually really surprised at how much I love how this turned out I also as just kind of a little added bonus I took one of my little Easter nests from last year's DIY place card holders and just set it on top of another one with a little bit of extra greenery that I had on hand so that's just kind of a little side thing this is not the focus of our project our Easter Bunny looks really legitimately like a cement one now I don't think that that has anything to do with a cement spray-paint that I used honestly I wouldn't recommend it just because I feel like to get the real cement look you have to take it through some extra steps so you'd be just as good as using a gray paint or gray primer so we're in this one to $3 ish give or take a little bit for supplies and it is really cute so next time you're thinking of throwing away some of those empty perfume bottles or beauty products and they have a cool top on it hang on to it you never know when you might need it so DIY number three we are doing a moss bunny sign now if you remember this sign from my last month's way cold dirt cheap episode I did the number 14 for Valentine's Day well Valentine's Day is over and if you remember I just stuck these on here with some little glue dots so in theory we should be able to pull these off super easy and we're gonna use the frame from that project who you do our spring themed pictures so this is gonna turn out to be very versatile and I have a feeling that it's gonna reoccur every time I do a "Way Cool, Dirt Cheap" who knows? I might shake it up here and there you never know but if you missed last month's way-cool dirt-cheap episode I'm gonna tell you how to prep the wooden frame which is actually a wooden canvas that I picked up at Walmart for $4.97 and I just flipped it over to the backside where I painted the interior part white and the exterior frame part black and then I slightly distressed it last month I used some glue dots to attach my number 14 and they ended up being way stickier than I thought that they would be so I ended up having to kind of sand this down and do some touch-up painting just because of how sticky the glue dots were now I picked up this moss sheet at the Dollar Tree the kind of hit and miss so if you see these grab them you can find moss sheets a lot of different places but this one was just a buck and it's actually the perfect size to fit right inside our frame I've got a printable for you of a bunny and you're gonna print it out and we're gonna use that as a template and we're gonna cut out our moss sheet now any time you are working with Moss you're just bound to make a huge mess so just know that now since our glue dots were kind of a fail we are going to attach our moss bunny using mounting putty instead and just attach this temporarily to our sign because you never know what we're going to use with this little sign next so we don't want to make it permanent I just think this is so cute so i put a little plaid bow on our little bunny is so cute so this was five dollars but we've now used it twice so that drops it down to $2.50 (US) we used a sheet of our dollar tree moss for a dollar and some extra ribbon that i had on hand so you really can't beat that we will be able to use this frame over and over and over again just don't use those glue dots they worked a little too good so next up we are going to be doing a carrot and pom-pom garland I'm excited about this because if you remember from couple months ago I made giant pom-poms and put them on pillows I put them on a throw blanket and I showed you how to make them I bought a set of these pom-pom makers and in that set there's this little itty bitty pom-pom maker and I think that this is the perfect project for that I picked up this green yarn from Michaels and it was on sale I don't remember it was just couple bucks we probably won't use hardly any of it I thought it would look really cute with these carrots that you can find at the Dollar Tree to make the mini pom-poms you take out one side of your little tool you're going to wrap it back and forth on your maker until it's almost full in the center and you're going to do it again on the other side once you have your maker closed then you're going to take some scissors and snip them until it's like this nice fuzzy thing then you're going to take another piece of yarn and tie it really tight in the center then you can pop open your pom pom maker and you have a mini pom pom I'm gonna be using some of this jute twine that I picked up at the Dollar Tree just because it's a little bit sturdier than the yarn a little bit stiffer so I think it will hold the weight of everything a little bit better and I kind of like that natural rustic feel especially since we're kind of we're kind of doing a very like farmhouse feel with a lot of these very springy earthy feeling and then we're gonna just rotate the pom poms and the carrots I used the excess pom pom string to tie them onto the twine and cut off the excess to blend in with the rest of the pom pom I used the twine to tie the carrots on and just as a little added reinforcement I used a little tiny dot of hot glue on each carrot we have our adorable carrot and pom pom Garland this was only a couple of bucks and you can make it as long as you want I am obsessed with it we're gonna go ahead and put this on our last DIY my favorite the Peter Rabbit sign you're gonna want to hold on to your seats maybe even keep a towel close by because you're gonna break a sweat no I'm just kidding this is probably the easiest DIY I almost can't call it a DIY I've made it so easy on you now if you remember from last month way cool dirt cheap we made this I love you sign and it is so cute I have just been loving on this for all month I'm loving my love sign if you have a 16 by 20 frame lying around your house or maybe you can find one at a thrift store for really really cheap we're now reusing this from last month's project so we'll probably reuse this frame multiple times depending on the season at least that's my plan so just reuse a sixteen by twenty I don't put the glass in it just because I feel like it looks more art like or sign like without the glass but you could totally put the glass in that's just a personal preference thing so this is how easy I've made this for you what you're gonna do is you're gonna need to download this adorable print and I provided the link below isn't it so cute this Peter Rabbit unfortunately this won't meet the criteria for printing it out as a color engineered print so you will have to print this technically as a poster and now you can do this at Walmart for $9.86 (US) which get you right underneath that $10 if you have the frame on hand already print it in a matte finish you get your print and you put it in the frame and boom you're done we're gonna take our garland from DIY project number four and just kind of stream it on to the picture frame and the carrots with the Peter Rabbit with the orange and the blue it's so springy and so cute and you're welcome for it being like the easiest DIY ever! I'm just kidding if you're interested in getting this print the link is in the description box below but for under $10 and you've already got the frame from last month this is a super cute this would look great in a nursery it would also look really cute for a baby shower and it's definitely cute for your spring and Easter decor. I have a three spring Pottery Barn dupes so let's get started my first dupe is the Aro vine baskets now they no longer carry this on their website but they were really cute so this will serve as a dual duty if you like these baskets are going to show you how to make your own since they no longer carry them but when they originally did carry em they range between a forty and sixty dollars per basket I'm going to be attempting to make the larger basket today and fortunately for me I already had everything on hand you know my husband's always saying why do you need all this crafting stuff well because right now I can't go out shopping because we're doing social isolation and so it's perfect the first thing we're going to do is we're going to take this basket and this is from the Dollar Tree and so one dollar very affordable and I have really liked the shape of this this is really great and also the mesh on it will serve as a really good opportunity for us to attach our grapevine now I have this leftover from a fall decorative pumpkin projects that I did I ordered this off of Amazon I believe it was about $7.50 I'll also provide a link for one of these in the description box below we are going to be using it to wrap around this basket and as our handle which brings us to our handle now I didn't think that this grapevine would be quite strong enough in and of itself I wanted to give it a little bit more substance so necessity is the mother of invention so what can we do to add support to our basket handle so I went looking for an old a wire hanger from the dry cleaners and we are going to try to be making and fashioning some support for a handle with this and we'll combine it with a grapevine so it will have a nice look but this wire hanger should hopefully add a little extra stability for our handle so you can actually hold it by the handle in theory so that's what we're gonna try to do with this so I start out by untwisting the wire hanger to separate it and then I unbend it and shape it into a U then I hooked one side onto the basket and twisted it on now I don't know if this is a good idea or if I should have just waited but it ended up working out fine in the end I cut a long enough piece of the grapevine wreath to fit on the hanger and slide the hanger through the middle of the grapevine and then securely fasten it on to the other side. I add extra wire where it connects to the mesh basket to make it really sturdy then I start wrapping the vine around the mesh basket and once I have it basically in place I strategically wire it to the basket as I go I remove some of the existing wire that holds the grapevine together so I can loosen it up and kind of spread it out a little bit I use the original wire from the grapevine and I cut it into four pieces I use that to wire it to the basket now that I have it basically how I like it's time to add a moss so I've got my cordless macdaddy a hot glue gun surebonder this comes in a mini which I'm going to be using today but I am loving this glue gun because it's cordless so it the cord doesn't get in the way of your crafting and then you just put it on the base and it charges while you're not using it so it is awesome I have so loved that and the link for that will be below as well next I randomly placed the glue and Moss sporadically around the basket I cut off a little bit of boxwood that I had on hand and strategically placed that around the basket now this is not on the original one so this is totally optional for you but I thought it looked really cute then I took it outside and I sprayed it with a couple of coats of hairspray just to make sure that everything stayed in place a little bit better now I wasn't gonna do the arrangement originally but I decided to go ahead and do it last minute so it would match the after pictures a little bit better so I didn't get footage of this process but I literally just had these daisies on hand and found some extra greenery and I kind of threw it all together last minute it was easy peasy and to be honest with you I actually like my version better than the original and their version was $60 and mine was just 11 and would only be around $9 without the flowers so what do you think of it? so for my next knockoff for spring is a tulip place card holder Pottery Barn sells a set of four for $30 and we are going to be doing ours for a tiny fraction of the cost Now, fortunately I'd already purchased these things because when I see them I'd like to stock up on these tiny little pots they are so cute you get three for a dollar that makes them 33 cents each and then I have some tulips leftover from my last episode's project and I think that they're gonna be perfect for this project and they're about $0.50 each then we're gonna use again some of our Moss from Dollar Tree we won't need very much and then I also have some scraps of styrofoam leftover from my last episode so these are like the bare bottom but you don't need much because these pots are pretty tiny from my last year's a place card holder i I just want to yanked them out for this project so that I didn't have to make new ones and now they're easy I just hot glue them in so if I wanted to go put them back in it all I'd have to do is glue them back into place that's all the supplies so let's get putting it together this project is ridiculously easy to put together you start out with your mini pot you need a small amount of styrofoam and you place it in the pot so it's nice and snug then you take two tulips and cut them about an inch below the base of the leaves then you put two tulips in one side and then again on the other side then I put some hot glue down on the foam and take a chunk of moss and fill it in so you can't see any of the foam then I take my pre-made wire from my last year's place card holders and shove it in the middle all I did with this was kind of take some wire and make a curly Q and then straighten it out on the end it's a pretty easy process if you look at it also another solution for you is to take the bottom section of the tulip it also has a wire in it that slides right out and you could definitely curl that in the same manner as the ones that I used and basically have a free version Again, I like mine better than the original I like the Pinker version of the tulip and I think these are just really amazing and at only six dollars for a set of four versus thirty it's got a better price to boot but what do you think my last Pottery Barn knockoff for spring is Peter Rabbit napkins that I saw over at Pottery Barn the regular price of these were 40 dollars for a set of four we're gonna be doing ours for pennies on the dollar so I created this printable right here I found this image on a royalty-free site so there's no infringement of copyrights or anything on this and so I've got this for you a provide a link for it in the description box below and I've gone ahead and printed it on some iron-on image transfer paper which I actually used in my Easter Bunny pillow recently so I had some leftover didn't have to go to the store all of the things that I'm working with I already had on hand so I had some pillow covers that I had cut and not sewn yet on hand so even though they were a couple of inches small I went ahead and used them because they were the right kind of fabric if you needed to purchase fabric I would recommend just using some simple muslin mine were cut to 18 by 18 inches but once they were sewn down they ended up being around 16 by 16 just for a point of reference the original finished size I believe is around 20 by 20 inches i hem the edges on my sewing machine now you could always use pre-made napkins and I definitely would not judge you but I find making them myself saves me a ton of money once you have them all sewn or purchased then we cut out our printable which was printed on the image transfer paper that I mentioned earlier then you got to peel off the backing very carefully it's a little bit tricky especially on the butterflies but it's doable I like to pull mine off using a pin then I warm the center of the bottom of the fabric for about five to six seconds then I lay down our image right in the center and then place a sheet of paper over it and iron it for about 40 seconds now I use my Easy press (Cricut) it just makes the job so much easier but you could definitely use a hot iron as well and just follow the directions on the package while mine is not an exact match as I typically like I am overall really happy with the end result here and definitely happy about the huge savings of $40 versus three dollars but what do think? so what do we do if we have a little extra time on our hands well if you're like me then I open up my laptop or turn to my phone and I go to Pinterest and look at all the beautiful things and then after that I hop on over to YouTube to learn how to make them right that's why I hope you're here today I've got three Pinterest inspired DIYs for you so let's get started my first Pinterest inspired spring DIY I've been seeing all of these cute bunny scapes on Pinterest I've seen them with a wreath of greenery around them I've also seen a garden scape kind of look and what's really great about this if I had everything on hand already I didn't have to buy anything I had this stone like cement Easter Bunny that I picked up at Ross last year for $5.99 these are pretty easy to find you can find any kind of bunny you want then I have this pot left over from my heart topiary tree I made two and I only ended up making one heart topiary and all I did is I picked up this pot plastic it's black and I picked it up from Walmart for like two dollars and ninety-six cents so very affordable and then what I did is I took a terracotta pot you can see like it's saucer and it was about a dollar and I took some black chalk paint and painted that and then glued it on just to give it more of a high-end finished look and so that was really easy to put together and then these were on my tablescape as well so the one thing I kind of toyed around with doing it like this and put some greenery but this is a little tiny bit too small so I don't think I'm gonna do that direction but what we're going to do instead is we are going to create kind of like a nest effect by setting around the rim of this and then we'll kind of build like a garden scape so then I have a whole assortment of leftover greenery that I had on hand I have a whole assortment of Dollar Tree white flowers that I used on my Easter table scape last year and then occasionally you just need like the top parts of flowers right so I have these leftover greeneries I think that using all of these greeneries together kind of creates a garden-y effect and normally you would maybe toss some of these greenery away I've got a paper bag and I'm just going to kind of tear this apart and crumple it into a ball we're gonna take that off first we're gonna shove this into the bottom up here just so we don't have to fill the entire thing with styrofoam because that is wasteful I have some left over green styrofoam from another project but I'm gonna take my hot knife because I have it on hand we're gonna cut it down and we're gonna put it inside here so that this is pretty stiff so this will give us a solid base for our bunny to sit on top of my husband is walking by all weirdly (laughing) so funny I think he was trying not to interrupt me I don't know if that's gonna make the cut or not do you want me to creepy just kidding! he's not. this hot knife is actually a very handy little tool it cuts through foam so easily and it's not very expensive either if you're interested I'll put a link in the description box below I use it to cut the green styrofoam down until it fits snugly into the pot it needs to be quite tight to support the weight of the bunny I fill any gaps with any extra and make sure that those are snug as well then I take my Dollar Tree wreath and place it on the rim I don't do anything to secure it because I figure all the greenery will kind of hold it in place but you definitely could if you wanted to then we start adding in our greenery try to place it in as you might see it in nature you want to mix the different type of greenery together kind of inner ring shape I then place the bunny to see how it looks peekaboo okay so I felt like the bunny was too far down so we put another square of styrofoam that I picked up from the Dollar Tree and had on hand already to lift it up a little bit more so we're just gonna place that here now when I move this around to like where it's gonna have its final spot I'm gonna take the bunny off because I'm not gonna permanently attach the bunny here because I may want to reuse him for something else down the road plus there's a lot of weight on here so now that he's sitting in here I'm gonna fill in with a little bit more greenery so basically I raided all my supplies and I'm like what can I use so I can have to spend any money on this project the different variation in greenery is really what's going to give it this awesome garden effect now we've got kind of a good little Foundation going and I thought you can never go wrong with fairy lights so we're gonna add some fairy lights in before we add a whole bunch of other stuff because I think that that way it will kind of disguise it a little bit better sometimes if you turn on the light so it helps you to place them a little bit this is a good opportunity to make our focal point and we're gonna put this I think right in here then I fill in with a few more of my leftover dollar tree flowers now I'm going to add some Easter eggs and I've also got some carrots and we're going to just kind of tuck them in and see how they look so we're just going to do a few finishing touches here my second Pinterest inspired DIY are these modern tulip arrangements that are arranged in these cylinder vases even though they're kind of being described as a modern arrangement, what I like about this is they really could go in many different styles of decor and tulips always are very springy to me so my microphone wasn't turned on during the section so we'll be doing a little bit more voiceover you definitely could do this arrangement with fresh tulips but I decided to do this with some silk tulips that I ordered off of Amazon that have an amazing and very realistic look to them they are actually even prettier in person than on camera I ordered 30 of these in bulk off of Amazon making them less than 50 cents per stem which I thought was an amazing deal and they have a multitude of colors so I'll put the link for these in the description box below I start out by taking a glass vase that I already had on hand now if you want to use the Dollar Tree cylinder vase you definitely could do this but this one's a little bit larger and I thought it would work really nicely for this project I picked up some black smooth stones at the Dollar Tree and I placed a few of them on the bottom of the vase then I go about arranging my tulips staggering the heights of the tulips with my tallest being in the center now you can arrange this however you like but this is just the approach that I took once I get them basically arranged how I like them then I'm going to mix my fake water kit I mix the whole kit and ended up not needing all of it and so I wasted a lot of it because once you've mixed it it's gonna dry hard so you can't really reuse it so if you're going to be using a Dollar Tree vase for example you definitely need much less so you can just make sure when you mix those that you do equal parts and save the rest for another project so for a Dollar Tree one I think you'd probably need about a half of this size package you will mix the water kit for about three to five minutes making sure to follow the directions on the package now when you pour this into the vase you want to avoid the side so aim for the center once you have your fake water in you can carefully replace your tulips back into their spot and you can move them around a little bit but you want to try and avoid moving them too much otherwise you might get some of the epoxy on the side of the vase and that's not a good idea then you can just set your arrangement whatever you like it and let it harden. I want to briefly tell you about antique candle companies new fragrances that they sent me to which are country pear and mango citrus both of them smell absolutely amazing and mango citrus might be one of my favorites of all time and it's a brand new scent if you're interested in purchasing these absolutely amazing smelling candles I'll put a link in the description box below so for my last Pinterest inspired spring DIY we are gonna be making some Easter bunny tags that you've been seeing all over I'm sure you've seen these type of tags all over Pinterest and I just I like them I thought they were cute and so this is a very inexpensive project now I got most of my supplies at the Dollar Tree and you know me I'm not a big Dollar Tree DIY er unless I really think that I can get a good look out of it now you can find these chalkboards at almost all dollar trees they're pretty readily available obviously that's going to vary from store to store but I've seen these in multiple stores and they generally have them on hand I thought that they were a good size they were lightweight I figured that we could cut through these without too much trouble you know if you're not big into celebrating Easter you don't celebrate it that's ok because you can actually switch this out really easy by writing spring and doing like a daisy flower on it so it's really flexible you can get a spring look with this and that's the purpose of this episode is to show you how you can get your inspiration from Pinterest and make it kind of your own and what's also awesome is you could make em reversible if you wanted to so i marked where I wanted to make my cuts including where I wanted my hole to go as well then I simply used my miter saw to make the cuts now if you don't have a miter saw you could use a handsaw this is just quicker for me and so I'd like to use it you know my motto girls can use power tools too then I took my half inch drill bit and drilled a hole I made sure to put a piece of wood underneath it to protect my bit and the table that I use I designed a printable which I will put the link for in the description box below that says Easter in two different fonts and also a little bunny I use some transfer paper to get the image transferred on to our boards but I'd almost suggest you use the chalk method because of the blackboard it did work out but you want to make sure you have pretty bright room if you're going to do it this way then I simply take some white craft paint and I use some inexpensive brushes from the Dollar Tree now I don't know if I'd recommend these but they did get the job done after they were dried i distress them as much as I could they didn't distress as well as I would have liked but it is what it is after they were distressed I used some rope that I picked up at the Dollar Tree and kind of did a slip knot on it and then tied a knot at the top so that they would hang like tags now if I were to redo this project in the future I probably would just use unfinished lumber especially since I ended up not needing to use my miter saw anyway because I think I would have gotten more of the look that I'm going for so stay tuned for that plus I think it might be a little cheaper this way especially if I use it my scrap wood that I have on hand that being said I did think these turned out rather cute I hope you're enjoying what you've seen so far I've got a lot more coming so you stick with me I'm NataLee and I'm a glutton for punishment. I'm going to be doing a thrift flip and I'm starting out by continuing at my endless mission to find a good thrift store I have had the worst luck have you been following my channel but my friend Lisa clued me in that I have a little bit of luck at a thrift store that I didn't know about that was actually really close to my home wouldn't that be funny if all this time the best thrift store was really close to my house and I totally overlooked it I have something in mind we'll see if I can make it happen so we're almost there wish me luck we have success! I'm so excited this is probably one of the best thrift stores I've seen and since moving to Orlando and I haven't even finished shopping here so I'm excited! do you see the smile on my face this is the smile of success who knew this thrift store is literally just a few minutes from my house I didn't know it existed and as you can see I've got some stuff in the back I'm pretty excited about now I'm not gonna be making over all of these items on this episode so you'll have to stay tuned for those coming up but I'm gonna be doing something with those lamps so I looked at this base of this lamp and I actually saw a lamp post it looks just like one it's like a column you could technically leave at this color... we're not, so I thought it would be fun to do an outdoor street lamp on a smaller scale I had another episode if you haven't seen it yet you'll definitely want to check it out after you check out all the other amazing goodness I did a DIY lamp post for Christmas and it was looked like a big tall one we are gonna convert this into a solar-powered lamp there's a lot of options with this project so let's get making over the lamps if you like this kind of project let me know in the comment section below because I have a lot of lamp post ideas for some reason I'm on that kind of kick the first thing we're gonna do is we need to take this lamp apart I've got to stand up I'm kind of short okay so we'll take out the lamp shade and then obviously we got to take out the light bulb it's not plugged into the wall and that's just how we want it how many people does it take to unscrew a light bulb? you gotta be careful you don't want to break these kind of because they can cause a lot of problems but supposedly environmentally friendly so just as long as they don't break so then we got to take off this harp so I then just untwist the light socket until it's undone and then I decided to just cut the wiring and pull it out the bottom leaving just the base of the lamp this includes the felt liner on the bottom of the lamp Hat? I don't think so... now I'm all about repurposing and reusing but unless you guys can tell me a good reason to hang on to this lampshade I think I'm gonna chuck it because I don't even like the shape so it would have to be a pretty creative idea so if you've got one let me know below so I've kind of gone back and forth back and forth and back and forth on this and I still haven't made a decision but there's already texture on the lamp so I have a flat black matte spray paint but I thought it might look cool to add a little more texture so I also have a hammered black so hopefully I make the right call here I'm gonna start with a flat black because I figure it will be kind of like a primer and if I'm not happy with it then I'm gonna resort to this one and these are both by krylon so we're just gonna start the spray painting these now if you're not lucky enough to find a column lamp base go ahead and substitute it out aren't these already looking so much like lamp posts now I ended up going with the matte black and it's actually not very matte in my opinion I definitely would put it in this satin to semi but I really did love this spray paint because it coated extremely well and I could turn it in different angles and the spray paint still came out so I really liked it I didn't end up going with a hammered finish because I felt like the lamp had enough texture after all so we are gonna really take it to the next level on the street lamp look I scoured high and low looked in my local home improvement stores and finally ended up on Amazon where I found a 2-pack of a solar-powered lamppost light right here and I'll put the link for this in the description box below but I thought these were perfect so they don't require any electrical wiring which I love but will still light up as long as they are charged by the Sun which in Florida here we have a ton of that so we're okay now it comes with this square and my lamps round and so that looks to me a little funny fortunately the bottom part does pop off and so we can get rid of this the problem is is when I get rid of this it makes it a little bit wobbly on here so my thought is I will take a little hacksaw and try to cut this off because this part does fit nicely onto our existing dowel and it will be nice and snug so I'm going to try cutting that off but if it doesn't work we'll brainstorm some ideas so I'm just gonna try this is my $1 dollar tree hacksaw and this is just plastic so I really think that we can cut through this success so we can push that back into here line it up push it in okay which is perfect so now it will fit on this really well look how cute that is I have some liquid nails just a little bit left I thought I had part of this so hopefully there's a little bit in there just so it's a nice permanent fix and that's it for the lamp post part other than charging up our lanterns outside of a Sun now these could look really cute on a dining table or just somewhere in your outdoor decor but I thought we could bring up this spring and summer vibe just a little bit more so meet me outside I'm going to show you what I've got in mind and it's gonna even add just a little bit extra because of all the beautiful weather I'm getting the bug to kind of spruce up my pool area here it really does need a makeover and I do want to do that pretty soon so one of my ideas was as I picked up this pot from Walmart for about five or six dollars and then I got this one at Dollar Tree for one dollar and I spray-painted this in the same black as I spray-painted the lamppost at the same time and I thought we could take some liquid nails and glue these together to make a kind of urn style one except for a huge discount because this is five dollars this is a dollar so it worked at like six or seven dollars into this whereas you could easily spend on an urn this size $30 without batting an eye so this is a huge savings so I thought I'd start out by putting some sand into each one of the bottoms not a whole lot but just to add a little weight it will also help with drainage and then I'm going to put some potting soil on top of that it kind of looks like brown sugar okay so my plan is to put our lamps right in the center of this and to give it a little added support I have these little dowels left over it's just to help it from not toppling over it's not really I'm not going to attach it to it I'm just gonna stick it down in the center so the lamp doesn't want to move around and topple so for a little spring flare I've got some greenery and some violets I think they're technically called violas but I've called them violets my whole life because they were my grandma Ruth's favorite flower because her middle name was violet and so these totally remind me of my grandma Ruth I've talked about her on this channel before she obviously had a big impact on my life and so I'm gonna plant these in here it's gonna be a little snug fit but I think that that's okay and we will just kind of Nestle those down I actually might pull this out plant them towards the edge and then put that back down in there but then it will give it that kind of spring and summer feel that we're going for now I picked this up at Walmart for I think this is $2.50 and the violets were $1.12 so very affordable so we've kind of planted this around the edge and it looks so pretty I love it now we're gonna take our lamp posts and very carefully moving the vines out of the way and any flowers out of the way place this into its spot all right I'm gonna water these even though I works in a plural shop that had a nursery in it for a couple years during college I tend to kill things in pots so if you all would just take a second to say a prayer that I don't kill these amen I'd appreciate it so just for the solar-powered lamppost I ended up spending about $30 a piece adding in the potted urns and the flowers was approximately another $15 each but for the impact that this gives I think this is a crazy good steal I'm totally in love with these slightly obsessed and I am so looking forward to making over my patio and pool decks in the coming months to go with these lovely little ladies so what are you thinking of this episode so far stick with me I've got way more designs coming up I have this heavyweight canvas pillow cover that we are going to alter I've had this for a while but I also found some inexpensive ones that you could also use off of Amazon and I'll put the link for that below and it has a zipper it's a little bit lighter weight than this one so I may try to find a heavier duty alternative on Amazon as well just so you have that as an option you could make a pillow cover from canvas or drop cloth and that would work really great as well and what we're going to do is we're going to start out by folding it in half so we can find Center this is a little trick that I always use to always find Center and then we're going to take a straight pin and we're gonna pin it just to mark we're actually not gonna leave the pins in it's just so we know where our Center is and Ike mark both the top and the bottom now we're gonna take some painters tape because we are actually going to paint some stripes on this pillow and we're going to line it up and try to find Center of the painters tape with the center of the pillow and tape from top to bottom and you might want to do the back side as well I'm going to but you don't have to it that's optional to you but I think the idea of the stripe going all the way around makes sense so we're gonna tape that off so I'm going to be using some chalk paint to paint on this pillow and I debated back and forth between Waverly celery and Waverly Moss both of them are very beautiful muted green ones a little bit lighter and one's a little bit darker and ultimately I think I'm going to go with the moss just so that it's a little higher contrast I don't know I really kind of like the celery so we'll see what happens in the end but I think I'm gonna go with the moss but you could pick whatever color matches your decor I thought about doing like a navy blue I thought about doing several other colors I think Green often acts as a neutral so it can go into a lot of different types of decor so that's why I am selecting the green so I hope you can follow me along on this process I start out by taking some regular blue painters tape and making a stripe right down the center of the cover making sure I go on both sides all the way around then I take some washi tape and tape on either side of that Center blue painters tape then I do a second stripe of washi tape right next to the first one unfortunately the washi tape didn't really want to stick to my canvas pillow cover but that's what I had on hand and I knew that I could still make it work I just need to be a little bit more careful and while we're talking about the pillow cover I totally should have ironed it beforehand that was a mistake on my end but I it still ended up working out fine in the end but I probably should have ironed that now that we have the tape on either side of the original blue painters tape in the center we can remove the center piece and move it to the outside of the washi tape I hope this is making sense if you watch what I'm doing I'm hoping that that will help you what we're trying to do here is create a French stripe then we remove the second stripe that is just next to where we just placed the painters tape then we can take that piece and move it onto the opposite side and repeat the process until we have one wide a stripe in the center and two smaller stripes on either side then try to push down the tape as firmly to the fabric as you can get it again my washi tape really didn't want to stick so I had to be strategic about how I went about painting it but now it's time to paint and I ended up going with them Waverly Moss chalk paint color I started by painting straight down or away from the edges of the painter tape not towards it once you get one side all painted then you're gonna allow that to dry and then flip it over and repeat the process and between this I just take the aluminum foil that I had my paint on and wrap it around my brush to keep it wet for the short time that it took to dry this worked out fine for me once it's dried and you can remove the painters tape and you will end up with this while this is drying we're gonna work on the next layer of this pillow so I wanted to create a layered look so I'm gonna be doing this next layer with a vinyl iron-on adhesive with my Cricut machine if you don't have a Cricut machine don't worry I've got you covered in the next step I'll let you know how we're gonna overcome this step for you I just like the idea of layering it and I think that the vinyl will be a little easier for me in the long run so I went into Cricut design studio and I designed my lettering and it says happy Easter in French and then another French saying I don't know what it means but it's an Easter saying and if you know how to speak French then hopefully you can interpret it for the rest of us but I can't even pronounce it... I'm not even gonna try so we're just gonna go ahead and cut it on my Cricut explore air 2- and I am just using grey vinyl if you do have a Cricut machine I'm gonna provide a link to the file that's already ready to go in the description box below and you can click on that and just go ahead and hit make it don't have to redo anything once you get your vinyl cut go ahead and weed it I don't know why but I really love doing this if you don't have a vinyl cutting machine here's how you're gonna do the lettering I provided a printable here that you can just print out and then I would take a piece of graphite paper like so and put it behind and then you'll lay it on your pillow and then trace it out and then the image will be on your pillow kind of in a pencil format and then I would take a gray paint pen or even just some craft paint and hand paint it on your pillow and just add to the layering that way so you can definitely get this look without having a vinyl cutter that's how you're gonna do it now we need a cute little Easter Bunny to kind of complete the look and I purchased this Jolee's boutique transfer sheets it comes with some for light fabric and some for dark fabric since we're using canvas I've decided to go with the light fabric one and all you're going to do is I have a free printable and I'll put the link for this as well as the printable in the description box below and I've got this cute little guy...isn't he so cute? anyway so you're gonna just print this out on the transfer paper then you're gonna want to cut out your bunny and once you're done cutting out your bunny in as much detail as possible now it's time to add the fun stuff but a couple things I've learned I think that if I were to do this again I would have gone with a lighter I do like this but I think that the lighter one would have worked a little bit better now we're going to attach our vinyl and our printable bunny this is where it gets really exciting okay so we've got our vinyl we gotta wait a few more seconds for our easy press to finish warming up now if you don't have an easy press you can easily just use hot iron and it sounds like our easy press is ready to go so what we're gonna do is we're gonna warm up our surface for 15 seconds before we apply it so we're gonna just kind of press down 15 seconds to make sure your paint is really dry at this point I think it will be okay okay so that's been 15 seconds we're gonna take our iron-on and line it up i I'm just eyeballing it to be honest with you so this is nice and hot you can see the steam coming off of it I don't know if that's good or not so after warming it up you're going to press it at 340 degrees for 40 seconds allowing it to cool mostly but not all the way before removing the clear protective layer next we're gonna pull off the backing of the bunny being very careful to not stretch it out on the edges then we're going to cover it all up just so it doesn't stick to anything I'm sure it's probably fine and then we're going to repeat the same process as we did for the lettering I am so happy with how our cute little Easter Bunny pillow turned out we are going to be making a pink peony wreath and I am making this peony wreath based on my love for peonies and I've had people correct me and say it's peonies and so I think it just depends on where you live or where you're from so some may say peony and some may say peony whether you say peony or peony then this tutorials for you last spring I made a pink peony arrangement you can kind of see it right back here even though I've added a few extra flowers since then it was one of my favorite projects last year and you guys enjoyed it too so I thought that for this spring we would do a pink peony wreath and as you can see I've got quite an assortment and I'm going to kind of go over this in just a second this is just a grapevine wreath that I had on hand from another wreath that I kind of just took apart and I'm going to be reusing you can pick them up for about 3 or 4 bucks you can find them pretty much anywhere what I wanted to do is have kind of an assortment of color and size within the pink peony range I found this Bush a pink peonies at Michaels and it was 50% off and I think that made it about six dollars for the bunch or around there and it's this really light pastel pink which is really beautiful but I wanted a little hint of like bubblegum and hot pink in it so I also picked these up at Walmart something fell somewhere story of my life so back to what I was saying I found these bubblegum and hot pink peonies and I thought they were really pretty at Walmart and there are $3 a stem and you get the big one with a littler one on the stem and I thought that could bring out some nice dimension through using different colors and then also at Michaels I got this little bunch now this one's kind of a little bit more expensive so this would be optional for you and this is $14.99 I got it 50% off so it was $7.50 for this small bunch but I liked that this bunch was smaller and that will add a little bit of the size variation within our wreath which I think will look really interesting and it was kind of in the middle of these two so it's definitely not as light as this one but more in like that true bubblegum pink and we'll probably use some of the leaves off of the stems as well for the peonies but I also picked up this variegated stem at Michaels and I just thought this really had a spring flare to it I love variegated greenery and I thought this would be a nice touch on our wreath let's get started if you haven't already discovered the surebonder glue guns I highly recommend them they are just so awesome they're cordless so that makes them easy to work with and then I also pair them with gorrilla hot glue which is awesome and it just works so well they are not sponsoring this post but I have put an affiliate link in their description box below if you're interested in learning more about them I used the mini size but I also own the standard size so depending on the size of your project you can adjust accordingly so we just start out by placing our peonies on the wreath for the most part I try to use a couple of inches of the wire stem that way I can push it down into the grapevine wreath and put a little dab of hot glue on each stem so that they kind of stay in place if you're doing this for outdoors you really want to do this step if you're doing it indoors you don't need to because it's not going to be moved around if you're doing it outdoors you're kind of opening and closing the door and you want it to stick into place to give it more interest I try mixing up the sizes and the colors and the direction that I put the peonies in at so some I'll put in at one direction and then I'll place it on a different angle going in another direction and this just will give it more interest and also we want to kind of spread out some of those colors so if we've got some of the hot pinks you want to put them in different locations and kind of spread it out throughout the wreath this is pretty much the same with the greenery as well since we got two different types of peonies there were two colors of peony leaves so we try to break those up and of course we also add in our variegated greenery which I just absolutely love what that brings to this wreath when it was all said and done I had a couple of holes so I had to take a quick trip to Michael's and they were out of single stem peonies and I'm guessing it was because they were having a buy one get two free sale which is awesome but I did find some pink cabbage roses that pretty much look identical to the peonies so I got those and added them in and you really can't tell the difference at all when it's all said and done I'm totally obsessed with this wreath I cannot stop staring at it screams spring to me and I am really looking forward to having it as a part of my spring decor now that we have a gorgeous pink peony wreath I thought it would be fun to make a wreath stand now I might put my wreath out on my front door I haven't decided yet but I wanted the option to display some wreaths indoors sometimes you just want to store your wreath inside where you can admire it all day and this may be one of those times because I really like how our wreath turned out so I decided that I needed a stand to display my wreath on and we are going to do this in very inexpensively and I'm going to be using stuff that I had on hand leftover from other projects and then I picked up a couple of very inexpensive things first I was able to find this spindle and it's an outdoor spindle for an outdoor deck and sometimes those can be pretty rough but this is actually not rough at all really so this is a dollar 98 and I picked it up at Lowe's it's a little too long so we're going to cut it down now I'm gonna be using my miter saw just because it's quicker it gives a really nice cut and I have it on hand but before I bought my electric saw I used to do everything with a miter box similar to this so if you don't have a miter saw you can totally pick one of these up I'll provide a link below in my description box but I got this off of Amazon for $12 it comes in really handy especially for things like this you will get a little bit of an arm workout but can't go wrong with that it can get a lot of these type of projects done very inexpensively so let's go build our stand right on cue my safety glasses went missing but we still need to protect our eyes so I'm looking stylish in my sunglasses and this will get the job done we've got our spindle that was a dollar ninety eight such a steal and I've got my hook which wasn't that great of a deal at $2.98 I felt like I could have gotten better but when you need something you need something so I spent the two dollars and ninety eight cents but look around you probably can find a better deal on their hook than that so we're gonna set it right at the base here and then I'm gonna make a mark right at the top here and that's where we're gonna cut and you can see that that made a really nice cut we're gonna hang on to this because you never know what you're gonna need it for and then we're going to cut off three inches from the bottom just so we have at the right size now we want to build a base so this is going to be the bottom part and then I have a whole assortment of scrap pieces of wood that we're going to use to kind of assemble this this is why I hang on to scraps that are about this size because you can use them for little things like this my original plan was to use a Dollar Tree sign that I had on hand but I decided that this was going to be a kind of a pain to deal with especially when we're going to be painting I thought it would possibly peel back a little bit easier and it didn't and I just don't want to mess around with it especially since I remembered that I had this scrap piece of wood and so I'm just going to go ahead and use this instead and I think that we can get the exact same look without having to mess with it and with the added benefit of it being much heavier you can see that I've actually marked where all the centers are and all we're going to do is take our drill and pre-drill make sure it's all lined up because this is going to be the bottom and I don't want it to wobble I'm going to just take my countersinking bit and countersink this so that way the head of the screw will go in all the way and then it won't wobble with my wood pieces in a pyramid shape and pre-drilled holes I take a three inch screw and screw it all the way through all of the pieces and drive it right into the bottom of the spindle for added support I put in a couple of finishing nails but you really don't have to do this part just make sure the screw is really tight originally I do the same process for the top pieces but this time only using two smaller pieces because I originally planned on using a leftover finial from a broken curtain rod and I was just going to glue that on top with some e6000 but then I decided it was just a little bit too big and I found the most beautiful knob with rhinestones at Hobby Lobby and since the knob already had a screw in it I put in a couple of finishing nails on top and then took the new knob and screwed it down into the original hole and then of course I attached the hook that we will use to hang the wreath on and to finish it all out I taped off the knob to protect the rhinestones and I spray the whole thing with two coats of rustoleum's oil rubbed bronze spray paint I am obsessed with my peony wreath I'm also obsessed with my DIY wreath stand so cute I mean a $2.00 spindle and scrap wood so this was a pretty simple project to put together the wreath is beautiful the peonies are beautiful so what do you think so far are you liking this let me know in the comments section below the most beautiful pink peony arrangement it was so pretty and I looked at the price tag and it was three hundred and sixty nine dollars you heard that right three hundred and sixty nine dollars it was so expensive and I just know that I would never personally pay that because well I can make it myself and I want to teach you how to do it to save yourself a little bit of money so what I liked about the arrangement was the beautiful vase that it was in it had a beautiful crystal vase with like a little stem on the bottom and then it had these beautiful pink peonies I love peonies there's some of my favorite flowers peonies and hydrangeas are two of my favorite flowers I just love them I love the way they look they're so romantic but at $369 I was like we can get that look for Less so I thought that this would be a perfect dupe especially with Mother's Day right at our front door this would be an amazing Mother's Day gift or even for your own home decor it's beautiful pink peonies are amazing so I'm gonna put all of my supplies in the description box below everything that I use will be there so you don't need to worry about that now I had this vase on hand I really lucked out I had found it at a goodwill a couple of years ago I paid about $2 for it so it was super cheap and I had on hand and it was about the right size and had a similar design on so for me this is perfect so go into a good will or your thrift store you'll find tons and tons of vases there it can be hit and miss then I got this candlestick from the dollar store and I did this already because I wanted it to be really set up for this video is I took some e6000 glued the candlestick to the bottom of the vase and now we have a very similar style vase to the one from Pottery Barn and what I've done I bought two bunches of pink peonies off of Amazon and they were $18.99 for both of them which is really good price because they were pretty full-sized bunches and the quality of the pink peony was super high it was really really high beautiful peonies but then I knew I needed a little bit hot pink because if you look at the original inspiration piece there's a couple of more intense hot pink peonies in that arrangement and what made it nice is that there was a great big mixture so I went over to Michael's and I got these and they were having a 60% off sale so they're originally $5 apiece and this was 60% off making them $2 a piece of that is a really good price all we're gonna do is it's just a mounded arrangement so I've taken my wire cutters and pre-cut all of the bushes apart and shortened all the stems of the ones that we're going to be using and we are just gonna place them in and just create a nice mound now what you're gonna want to do is you're going to want to make sure that you do some variation of height just very subtly because what makes a really nice design Mound is when there's like a variation of heights so you just want to make sure you spin around and make sure it looks good on all sides so we'll just make some adjustments here and if one's too long then just take it out and clip off just a little bit at a time and that way you don't overdo it what I like is that I have some of these little tight buds mixed with some that are kind of medium and some that are fully blown just like you would with a real peony I am so excited about this so you want to disperse all the colors and the texture so you can see that there's varying heights of the peony as some are poking out a little bit more than others some are tucked in a little bit more than others and that gives it just kind of a more natural fun look so overall I'm really happy with all this turned out... now that we've got it arranged the way we like it what we're going to do is we're going to lift this out and put it in another vase or pitcher or something that can kind of hold the shape while we work on the fake water okay so all we're gonna do is I'm gonna sacrifice this I got this at the dollar store if you have a plastic cup that will work as well so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna use this entire amount of water what you're gonna want to do is mix equal parts and they say on the package to kind of do it down the side so it helps with the air bubbles when you do it this pour it in this way we want to get all of it the contents in and it has to be equal otherwise the curing time will take longer might create more air bubbles so while we mix this for three minutes I was just wondering if there are any other things you would like me to dupe about there any designer items you would love to see me do if so let me know in the comments section below I'm always looking for ideas of things that I can dupe for you guys it's time to pour into our base now as we pour it into our vase we want to be very careful to avoid the sides the vase because if so we'll get on the side so we're going to aim for the center also you want to make sure that it's clean and free of any water or dust or anything because anything that's in there will be in there for good so we're going to pour our fake water in very very carefully right in the center so now I've tried this with an epoxy before and it just takes so much epoxy and it's just not as pretty so you really want to do stick with a water kit now we're gonna very carefully gather our bouquet out of the temporary container and we're gonna gently set it in and make sure all the stems are inside the vase and then just very carefully set it into place now it is a little bit a little bit forgiving so if everything doesn't pop right back into place we're just going to make a couple of modifications before it sets up because it actually takes about 8 to 10 hours to cure so we've got a little bit of wiggle room you don't want to move it too much you know just because you can make a mess out of it but you know pushing things in or just making small adjustments that's quite all right so I am really excited with how this is looking overall this is less than thirty-six dollars I am so excited about this because every holiday season I think everybody goes online and looks for ideas and kind of to see what sounds good and what looks good to them and I kept seeing a common theme of these bunny dishes they are so cute I found a couple of sets one from Pottery Barn and one from Williams Sonoma that I loved... I loved both of them I thought they were adorable and then I looked at the price and I was like hold up! how much? and it was between 50 and 60 dollars for a set of four plates and I was like no no no no especially when I need like a set of eight to set my table I'm going to show you how to do it for less than ten percent about five dollars for a set up four plates and you're gonna have made them yourself soon you'll be so proud of them and they're gonna be cute and we're gonna do this so let's get started here's how we're gonna go about it I'm gonna give you it like a general idea and then we're gonna start so I've got these clear plates that I got at the Dollar Tree and then I have a set of four royalty-free hand painted bunnies that I printed out on my printer we're just gonna start by cutting them out and then we're gonna decoupage them on and then we're gonna paint some cool designs.. now I don't know if you can see in the background there but this is my Pottery Barn version and this is my Williams Sonoma version they're so cute what we're gonna want to do very first well let's move our cute little bunnies out of the way for just a second because what we're gonna do is we're gonna take our plates and we're gonna peel off the sticker and then it came off pretty good but there's a little tiny bit of debris and just avoid debris and fingerprints and all that we want it to be very clean so I just have a cotton pad and some rubbing alcohol and we are going to just clean the back of it that dries very quickly now that our inspiration piece there's a kind of a brown banding around the edge very subtle detail we've got a paint pen here from craftsmart I couldn't find that color name on it we're gonna use this for the edge banding here this is the first thing we need to do is it do the edging because we can't have it mixed with anything else so you just gonna go around edge I see that it has a lip and we're just very carefully moving the plate.. not the marker and it's okay if it's a little imperfect but we're trying to try to get it even as possible we're gonna let this dry it doesn't take very long at all and while we're letting it dry we're gonna cut out our bunnies I love these bunnies these are so cute stay tuned to the end and I'll tell you where you can where I got these ones but honestly you can go and find whatever bunny you want I've got my to be like uber perfect so we have our I am so in love now this is dry now we can decoupage our bunny on... which one should we do? this is very important you need to get dishwasher safe Mod Podge if you don't then they're not going to be washable if you want to wash them you've got to use the dishwasher safe Mod Podge so make sure that you get that we are gonna put some Mod Podge on the front of our rabbit I'm not the don't stick but not like globby at all before it dries very carefully because you don't want to rip the paper that's already wet we're gonna bring our plate over and we are gonna try to Center it or just place it where you want where you think so he touches the bottom and then his face will show so we're gonna start at the bottom and we gotta be careful around where it bends just so that it doesn't crease you just kind of work with it and work out any kinks and if a little bit hangs off the edge of the plate that's okay because we'll just trim that up later more or more trying to get this to lay nicely totally adorable but we're gonna leave it upside down to dry and then once it's dry we'll give it like an hour or two we'll come and put another coat of Mod Podge on the back end before we start applying any paint okay so our Mod Podge has dried look how cute these are now we need to do a coat on the backside so we put it on the front side now we're gonna put it on the back side and what we're gonna do in this case I am just gonna go just outside the cutout and make sure that the cutout itself is covered thoroughly and then we're gonna let it dry for another hour or so so this is going to take a little bit of time but it's gonna be so worth it this is where it gets all kinds of crazy all kinds of fun all kinds of messy if you have a manicure it's toast! but you'll earn after you do this and you feel good about cuz all the money you saved... so ok so I got this stencil at Michael's it was originally ten dollars I used a 40% off coupon so it was six dollars we can use it for all of our plates and it's from Martha Stewart collection and it's an iKat so we're going to use this to kind of mimic the pattern in the williams-sonoma version and it works out really great so but it's gonna be messy I'm not gonna lie so we just lay it down on the plate and where it bends we're gonna have to push it down kind of like this so we may start from the top and then like work our way back and then you're gonna have to fill in a couple of holes here and there and I'll show you how that goes so again we're going to use this whispering turquoise as our kind of blue hopefully it's not crazy intense but it will be fun so we'll start up here and we just get it wet dab it off a little bit you don't want it too wet because then it will leak and what's nice about this ikat pattern is it's already kind of naturally messy and so if it's not perfect it's okay because it's ikat you want it to go on a little thick well and not being runny only because you're not gonna get a second chance to put on it like a second coat you can kind of touch up a a couple of spots here and there but generally speaking this is your one one shot so we're going to take this up and there's gonna be a couple of bare spots so we're gonna just randomly take so we've got like this outer corner thing and some of these and I am just gonna randomly place to fill in a hole my nature of using a stencil it's gonna get a little bit messy and there might be a couple of spots that you want to go in and clean up so what you're gonna do is dip a q-tip in some rubbing alcohol and very carefully just go clean up the couple of areas that you may need to clean up and then we're gonna let these dry clean up our messy fingers and we'll be back to finish it off now we need it to pop so we're gonna just paint white over the entirety of the back part and I'm just gonna brush this on with some chalky craft paint but you know you could also take some spray paint and spray that on and that would work out good is well but this is what I have and so that's what I'm gonna work with we need a brush I'll just use this one I'm just gonna use a foam brush but we'll just use this one cuz they have it available here we go so you want to cover the entirety of the back make sure you cover the paper it just adds one more layer of protection on the piece of paper that we Mod Podge on and you're probably going to need to do two at the minimum a possibly three coats to get that really nice bright white that's it and then we're gonna let it dry for a couple of hours we are almost finished I know this is like a lot of passive time a lot of drying time the part itself painting is too terribly long but it's all going to be worth it in the end now we've got our two coats of white on and now it's time to seal it because if you want this to be washable want to even throw it in the dishwasher I don't know if I'll actually two remaining in the dishwasher but if you want to throw yours in the dishwasher then you're gonna definitely want to do this step to help it preserve for a long time so we're gonna pull out our dishwasher safe Mod Podge again we're gonna do two good coats of this on the back and let it fully dry okay so it says we need 28 days for this to cure but if we don't have 28 d ays we're going to try out a little hack on that see if it worked out but by using the ovens I'll meet you back here and a couple seconds your time and a couple hours my time we are done our plates are so cute would you love these on your table I've got a couple of them classy yet fun! I am so excited for Easter to be coming and I just love all the things on Pottery Barn but they're really pricey you can get the look for Less without spending a fortune and people will think that you got it there my first dupe is on Pottery Barn they have these really adorable mini nest place card holders now I'm gonna do this today and what I've gotten is I found these picks at Michaels now in the original version there is three eggs you'll notice this one only has two I was fine with it but if you really want the three they did have the three as an option it just was a little bit more money and I thought well two is fine if this one is originally four dollars but half off it was two dollars and one with three eggs was six dollars or three dollars a piece let's get started with this one first all we're gonna do is clip off the back of this pick your left with this really cute nest now we need something to put our name card on our place card holder so I bought some jewelry wire and the reason why I went with the jewelry wires this is a little bit heavier gauge but it has a prettier finish than the floral wire pick up some heavy wire around the house go ahead and use it you can only spray-paint it if it doesn't come pretty finished we're just gonna clip off a little bit so what I'm going to do is I'm going to start out with a pen and I am gonna start curling it grab the needle nose we're just gonna keep curling it because we're just gonna make a little swirl in which that we can put the name card in and then we're gonna a little bend and then we're gonna see things working and it looks up like about three inches and then we're simply gonna just cut that off and we're left with this little curly Q and we're gonna just put a little hot glue on the bottom here we're gonna shove it down in between the eggs and we'll hold it for a second to let it set up and that's really it then once the glue sets up then we can put art of the little name card in it and we have so easily duped the Pottery Barn version my next project I am so so excited about this probably might be the one that I'm most excited about which were these moss-covered rabbits they have on Pottery Barn they are really adorable but for 80 bucks we can do better so I originally found these two smaller bunnies for they were originally $7.99 at Hobby Lobby half off or $4 a piece and I was just gonna do but then I found a mama bunny Ross for $8.00 now they're more about this size the ones from pottery Barn's but I thought you know even like the little ones that you can still get the same look and on the backs of them they had like little ivy growing off of it now the Ivy was really tiny and I couldn't find an Ivy that was tiny enough that I really liked but I found this bush at Hobby Lobby and it was $6.99 half off so $3.50 for this bush and I think that it will work for all of them it will be enough and I'm going to start on the babies first so I'm gonna set momma aside for just a second we're just gonna cut apart this into little tiny sections and all we're gonna do is hot glue it on so this is gonna be another very quick project where we're gonna have massive savings that Pottery Barn version they had some greenery on the head and on the back and the little strategic spots so we're gonna start by gluing this on the back a little dab in the ears where you can't see very good and we'll hold it into place for a second and like all these projects are a little hot glue a little cutting so easy you guys can totally do this hold it in place for just a second...so while we're waiting for the glue to dry, why don't you let me know what kind of projects you like to see me do we'll just keep working at it until we feel like it has a good look and we'll keep referring to our Pottery Barn example okay so I am done with my bunnies I'm so excited with how these turned out they're so cute huge savings okay so like the big one would have been about $80 at Pottery Barn and this was less than 10 and now I'm going to start on my last project which is some bunny burlap napkin holders now this is one that they used to have at Pottery Barn like last season still think they're cute and they have an updated version of it on their website right now that's gold but I for my table I wanted the more natural version so I've taken some burlap here I have it left over from another project and I have some toilet paper rolls what we're going to do is I am going to measure it to one and a half inches I'm gonna just make marks all the way around and then we're going to connect them so we know where to cut and then I'm just gonna take a box cutter here a sharp one and cut on the line... if its sharp this should not be too hard and the reason I didn't want to do scissors was because I didn't want to pinch it or create a crease okay so we cut this to one and a half inches and then we're gonna take about a two and a half inch by six inch piece of burlap which I'm just gonna kind of eyeball what you need is a little bit of overhang on each side and enough to wrap around the roll we are going to just put some hot glue the middle part of this enough about an inch and half white because we're gonna stick our toilet paper holder piece and get on very carefully and that one spot and then we'll just roll it in and then to finish it off we're gonna just put another line of glue and close that seam so it's completely glued on let it set for a second and then we're gonna put hot glue on the inside rim and then we're gonna tuck our unfinished edges in alright so you would never know that this a toilet paper holder now we've got to make the ears okay so we've got a three inch by eight and a half inch piece of burlap that we're going to make bunny ears out of so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to fold this in half lengthwise about an inch in the middle we're going to do a line of glue on the edge here and then we are going to press that down now I use I've been using these pliers because I don't want to... I burned my fingers a couple times so instead of burning my fingers I'm using my pliers to kind of stick it down because the glue kind of squeezes through a little but now that we've included in half lengthwise we're gonna fold it in half the other direction and do a nice crease right in that crease we're gonna add some glue to glue it together so now you can see that we've kind of got some bunny ears going but these are rough like square edges and bunny ears are pointy so all we're going to do is cut just the shape of bunny ears at the top and there you go! and then you have bunny ears and now we're gonna attach it and I'm going to cover up this seam of another bead of hot glue stick this down you're gonna have to hold it while it sets up but it's really that easy and we're gonna be done with our little project all the bunny's the place card holders and these napkin rings we're getting the same kind of look but we're saving a boatload of cash there it is so it's super cute hardly any money basically in my case it was free but he had to buy a little burlap if you wouldn't need that much and it would be super cheap and we have adorable bunny napkin ring holders it doesn't really get much easier than that and we've saved probably hundreds of dollars on these things you can do this too I know you can all the designer knockoff all the Pottery Barn williams-sonoma and all of those things are gonna be on our Easter table so let's get started and let's set our table okay before we get too far into this I'm just wondering what you think of my dining room table makeover I am so happy with how it turned out but let me know in the comment section below what you think about the before and after now that you get to see the whole thing. if you've watched any of my table scaping videos before you know that I have kind of a process of how I go about setting my table and usually it starts out with a crisp white tablecloth but this time I wanted to shake things up because they have a lot more natural elements that I'm bringing in for Easter and so this time we're starting out with a linen tablecloth by now you certainly know that I love to use wrapping paper on top of my tablecloth and the one that I selected today I got at the Dollar Tree and I just loved it because it had kind of like that natural craft paper look but it had little flowers on it that we're in white but it was really subtle kind of like a nice little textural nod to spring and I just love it let's put it on just barely enough for my really long table I also like to add an additional runner again it's always about layering and adding more texture when you are table scaping in my Thanksgiving poolside tablescape I'll put the link above I used a burlap runner and I'm going to use that again the one I did was outside of my tables longer and here so I'm gonna make another one so it looks like I had just barely enough and the end is kind of wrinkled so I'm gonna go iron that real quick and we'll put it back on ok so one of the really awesome things about table scaping is just like with our burlap runner you can sometimes reuse things you know I probably won't reuse the wrapping paper because we'll get stuff and drips and spills on it but the things like the tablecloth and the runners and things you can reuse them just put them with different decor and get a totally different look okay so for my floral centerpiece this was super easy you can totally do this what I did was start out with a trifle dish and a wide mouth mason jar and I put that in the center and then I filled just some Easter eggs speckled Easter eggs that I got at the Dollar Tree now they came in with purples and yellows and pinks as well but I only opted to do the blue greens and whites because it kind of matched my decor already but I love all the pastels and that would look really fantastic on your table if the that works with your decor as far as the flowers I have a few flowers in here that are super nice that I have around my house all the time and I bend them and just reuse them and make it work and then I mixed them in with lots of bunches of white flowers from the Dollar Tree probably like 7 or 8 and I just I didn't even cut them off the bushes I just shoved them in and kind of intertwine them a little bit and honestly it's just a mounded flower arrangement it's super easy to do 7 or 8 bushes and then a couple of nice flowers that I've had are from around the house and bam you have an awesome centerpiece for Easter I don't know if you recognize this tray but I featured this in my Valentines tutorial it was filled with the little tea lights well I went to Michaels and got some of this grass mat and cut it down to fit inside of it then the grass mat was like regularly ten dollars but Michaels is always having like 50% off or 40% off coupons so I was able to grab this for 6 dollars it was on a 40% off sale and I also grabbed these other little speckled Easter eggs from Michael's as well they were three dollars bag I think I got they get two bags or one back I don't remember but there were three dollars a bag and they are so cute so we're gonna put that right down low in front so on my last episode you will remember that I did a dupe of pottery Barn's I think I called bunny ivy topiaries or something like that these looked a little bit different than what I showed you but I kept looking at it and I felt like it was missing a little something extra and so I actually happen to have some of this greenery on hand this variegated stuff and I decided to add it on and it just really took it over the top and it really added that something that I felt like it was missing I got a on a clearance sale so I probably didn't pay more than a dollar for the greenery and I've added it to all of our moss bunnies from last tutorial so we're gonna put them on now I'll notice on this one I ended up placing it on a little cupcake stand just to give it a little height to balance out with the other side so we'll just tuck them in here I love these little bunnies they're probably one of my favorite knockoffs just to balance things out with the other side weight-wise I've got this little sign at Ross that says hello honey bunny anyways I thought that would look really cute on her tablescape so I just wanted to add a few finishing touches I've got a whole bunch of these moss like covered stone things that I got at the Dollar Tree and we're just gonna scatter them in here and just fill it in a little bit and then I also have some of these extras of the speckled egg so we're gonna just place them strategically through out. okay so on pottery barn I saw the most adorable wood charger plates and I knew that I was not going to spend $40 a piece so I found some chargers that had like a wood look to them on dollartree.com and honestly truth be told they looked a little bit more wood like than they are I mean you can see the grain but these ones are definitely more gold and I was going for more natural but I think it's gonna work and I debated about whether or not to even use them because I have like kind of a double charger thing going on so I'll show you what I mean in just a second but let's get these on the table you'll notice that I'm only setting the table for six I only have six chairs I'm looking for the perfect captain's chairs I've not yet found them yet so you'll have to watch for that cuz I'm sure that will involve some kind of tutorial for you so stay tuned for that okay so I mentioned that I had debated whether or not to even use chargers I ultimately decided on it because I liked the added layers but I got these ivy wreaths at the dollar tree dollar piece and they are the perfect size for a plate to go on top and they look like a you know a nest and we have definitely a nest thing going on so again I'm gonna use both of them because I like texture but you could get away with just using these so now it's time to set our dishes and and you'll see me use these time and time again I'm just using everyday white plates it works out great because we have those decorative bunny damask plates that we did I always find that food looks beautiful on a traditional white plate so it works out great I just love how the white plate is in a little birds nest it's so cute okay so we have our williams-sonoma bunny damask dishes dupe that we did I'm so excited to finally put them on my Easter table and you'll notice that I actually did them in two different colors so this one's kind of more of like a steely blue and this is more of a turquoise so I'm going to just alternate those every other chair this is turning out every bit as cute as I had hoped now we need to let people know where to sit so it's time to put on our little place card holders a dupe of Pottery Barn spring is in the air alright time for stemware okay so in our last tutorial we duped some older napkin rings by Pottery Barn burlap bunny ears so we are gonna place those now so cute and I am just gonna place it right on the edge of the right-hand side of the plate my Easter tablescape is done I am so thrilled with how it turned out I hope that you liked it too if you did let me know in the comment section below what your favorite element was and maybe what you didn't like or maybe what you thought is missing I like to hear all of your comments believe it or not I want to see your Easter table too so in order to do that you can hop on over to Facebook to my Facebook page designed to the nines and in that Facebook page there's a secret group called "all things home related" and you can upload your projects and share out on your Easter table successes and I so look forward to seeing those I am here outside of Trader Joe's today because I'm going to be teaching you how to make a beautiful bouquet of flowers you can use this to give to a friend to give to someone you love you could even use it for a wedding but one thing's for sure is it's gonna be on a budget it looks like I'm here on a good day they've got a great selection I'm probably going to do something in the pinks and blues and purples and just really soft romantic colors they have an awesome assortment of greenery that we can use to fill in we're just going to shop here their hydrangeas are only $5.99 for a bunch and I can tell you that's a fantastic price as well as their oriental lilies are only $5.99 those are crazy good prices so that's why I like Trader Joe's ok so I want to show you what I've decided on and I feel honestly like I'm cheating a little bit by doing this but I wanted to show you how easy it can be for you so they had these little mini bunches for $3.99 a piece that I thought were really cute so I selected three of them that I felt coordinated well together then I picked up some seeded eucalyptus and some Hypericum berry which I love to use in a lot of my Arrangements I just really like the way that it looks you can find it in green red and white I also selected some white stock which smells amazing I just love the fragrance I like the color and I think it will provide an additional interesting texture so now we're gonna go check out we'll head home and I'm gonna put something together we're gonna put our own little twist on it and even customize it a little bit more so it feels really really special we are back from our trader Joe adventure and what do you think of my new shelves I just built that in the last episode I am so excited about it I haven't decorated them yet I did throw up a couple of things just to get me excited so that makeover is coming up very soon have you ever had one of those days where you're like you really need something and you can't find it and you look and look and look and look you can't find it I'm having one of those days so I could not find for the life of me my floral shears they always wander off when I need them so I looked for a good long time and then I'm like forget it so I'm gonna be using my easy action Clippers I'm gonna make do with these today and I know the second I hit stop on that record button they're gonna magically show up right you can relate to that right so you can take all of the bunches of flowers that you purchase and group them together and tie it off and have that be your bouquet but since I'm adding in the white stock and the seeded eucalyptus I just decided to start from scratch so I start out by taking one of the larger roses and some of the statice which is what the purple filler is called and grouping them together and then I add in some of our stock and and seeded eucalyptus and I'm going to be adding in some of our spray roses with that hot pink color that's kind of variegated it's so pretty and they also have some really cool decorative greenery in those bouquets one that was kind of like a purple cabbage looking type of greenery and some others that offer a really cool texture one thing that I think makes bouquets look designer is when you have texture and that includes having some flowers that are poking out a little bit further and some that are tucked down a little bit instead of mounding them all into one giant round sphere the variation is what creates interest and the interest it makes it feel more designer the other thing that's really designer looking is grouping small clusters of flowers together like these spray roses while you do want little clusters of flower it is nice to spread out different colors throughout the bouquet if you find you have a little hole just push a flower and through that and grab the stem from underneath and gently tug it down to the bottom then I do little sprigs of seeded eucalyptus throughout the arrangement but I try to keep the stems as long as I can especially so they can reach the water we're trying to make it the same length the purple little spear looking thing is called salvia I love salvia and I love how they pop out of the arrangement and just add a little bit of interest one of my favorite flowers are hydrangeas and they love these little small green hydrangeas that came in the bouquets the cluster of Lily like flowers in the magenta color are actually called alstroemeria and I love the softness that they add to this bouquet you can see that there's a little hole so I just tucked a little rose in to fill in that hole I also tuck in my Hypericum berry so I try to use the floral tape but this one is just not as sticky as others that I've worked with in the past so in the end I end up just duct taping our bouquet together so I know that it's solid and it's not gonna fall apart now they do make a green duct tape but since I'm not doing it as much as I used to in the past I don't have that on hand and the regular duct tape will be just fine for this case and then I just cover it up with the green floral tape so you can't even see the gray duct tape and then I make sure all of the stems are cut to the same length look at this bouquet is so pretty! I just love this it screams spring is a very romantic I love it I like to wrap my stems in tulle and so I always have this six inch tulle on hand for flowers for floral arrangements but also for wrapping presents so you know and tying a bow on it so I have this handy all the time so we can you know do a contrasting bright color like a aqua color here we could do something in the gold we can also go kind of the rustic route and do something with like a burlap and wrap the stems in burlap and that could look really nice kind of like the farmhouse chic but I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to do this white glittery tulle it has it picks up kind of the pinks and purples but it's like classic white and so I think that I'm gonna use that so we're gonna wrap the stem in that so then I can add a bow and I want to let you in on a little secret I always hit the holiday ribbon when it's 75 to 90 percent off so then I have a stockpile of ribbon that I've gotten super inexpensive but Dollar Tree also has some fun ribbons like this pink one would go really nicely with our bouquet I may even use this one I just like my bouquets to feel really really special I've done a lot of wedding bouquets and I always like to personalize it a little bit so sometimes I'll put feathers coming out of their bouquet or something else but on the bouquet stems itself I like to take some like little type of bling I've had some where I've had the word love on it and that one was really pretty I like that one I've done people's initials hanging from like some smaller ribbons and that's really pretty but I had this idea so sometimes we have broken jewelry or jewelry that we're kind of over that's not really our style anymore or things like that a necklace this one's kind of like a rhinestone-y star one that I thought we could glue on top of the tulle and things like that you could do a brooch this is a broken brooch so it doesn't have a pin on it so we can just hot glue that right on I think that one was actually really kind of fun before I add my dragonfly embellishment I add a couple of purple thinner Sheer ribbons I picked up from the Dollar Tree as well this part is optional but I just think it adds a little bit of extra fun in the end I ended up spending around $25 for this large bouquet again you could definitely do it about half the size and you don't have to add in all the extra flowers but I really wanted to go over the top with this arrangement and it feels like spring in the most grand possible way and I just adore this bouquet. well I hope you enjoyed this episode if so here's another one that I think I like as well and until next time to all of my DIY Niners bye!
