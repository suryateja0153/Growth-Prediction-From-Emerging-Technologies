 it is now time to catch up on the latest developments in the electronic space having an external interface which allows you to interact with your computer by creating shortcuts definitely goes a long way in improving efficiency we looked at doing something like this by using some capacitive touch buttons along with the pixi atto but free Dec takes this to a whole new level it interfaces a total of 600 LED modules with an Arduino micro this is the same chip that is used in the pixie atto since the OLED modules themselves do not have a touch interface the designer has added a tactile button under each display to allow you to select it by gently pressing down on the module which is a pretty neat idea if you have ever used these OLED modules before then you will know that they all share the same address which makes it difficult to add more than one to the same eye to see bus free decks solves this by using two 4:05 one multiplexer ICS that switch the i2c data line across the displays the best part about this entire project is the visual configurator tool that allows you to easily update the displays and shortcuts some of you might be aware of the professional alternative called the stream deck which is designed to do something similar however the mini version costs about 89 pounds or about hundred and ten dollars which means that there is definitely a lot of merit in making your own DIY version of this our Ruby is a pocket-sized quadrotor drone that uses ardupilot and has been designed for a wide range of applications including research for education or for fun it is powered by a single 18 650 battery and weighs about 102 grams which is impressive an STM 32 cortex m4 microcontroller is used as the flight controller and we also have an esp8266 module for Wi-Fi telemetry apart from this we do have the essential sensors and components that are required for a drone which include the IMU or inertial measurement unit a barometer a compass an RC receiver and so on this will be released on Kickstarter soon and you can sign up on their website to stay notified add solute acrylic displays definitely give you a nice visual effect and the next project tasks us in a slightly different way it uses these tiny addressable RGB LEDs which are carefully placed on the edge of the acrylic pieces to animate them these are then arranged to create several 7-segment edits that are collectively used to display the time in the Adafruit itsy-bitsy m4x press board is used to control the LEDs while a d1 mini board is used to obtain the networked time the design files along with the detailed instructions are available for you to use and the end result is definitely worth the effort I've received several requests on this channel to create a digital timer that can be used to control devices and for that our third using blink was the best way to proceed as it allows you to update the timer using your smartphone however if you are looking for something a bit more standalone and check out this next project that uses an RTC for timekeeping the ds3231 RTC chip is very popular and has an interrupt pin which is used to control the external device by providing a logic signal when the alarm is triggered in this case a MOSFET is used to control the input power to the two voltage regulators these can then be used to power external devices the RTC chip can be programmed over I to see and once program the power consumption is minimal as only the RTC chip is active when the required time is reached a signal is sent to enable the voltage regulators that can be used to power additional boards or modules all the design files have been made available for you to use on the designers github repository this Kickstarter campaign is raising funds for a very beautiful Raspberry Pi case that has a honeycomb texture to it they claim that it can be used with various different single board computers and even has space for some accessories these include a hat and also some space to add a hard disk or solid-state drive for storage the end result is definitely interesting for several applications and the case is available for about twenty nine euros this planetary gear clock is definitely a work of art it combines an Arduino a real-time clock module a motor driver and a stepper motor to precisely control the clock giving you a beautiful visual effect a laser cutter was used to make the gears and other bits we choose a combination of wood and acrylic a very detailed instructable post is available which contains all the instructions you need to build one yourself finally we have bread B which is a tiny embedded Linux single board computer the main chip that is used here was designed for camera applications however the bread B is not meant for such applications but is intended for much simpler control applications it runs embedded Linux which means that it will be much easier for you to control devices or obtain sensor readings over a network it only supports Ethernet for now which makes it a little less attractive however the cost to make it is about $10 in small quantities if you want to do it yourself this will be launched and crowd supplies soon so we can only wait and see what the final price will be like and that is it for this episode of water hour come back next Tuesday to catch up on some more electronics news thank you for watching and I will see you in the next one
