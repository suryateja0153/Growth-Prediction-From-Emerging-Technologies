 hey guys welcome to this session by intellipaat so in this session we'll be learning the top interview questions for Microsoft Azure comprehensively so before moving on with this session please subscribe to our channel so that you don't miss our upcoming videos now let's take a quick glance at the agenda we'll start off with the basic Microsoft Azure questions like what is the Azure and how does it compare to other cloud services like AWS and GCP moving at will be looking into domain specific or service specific questions we'll start off with storage services where we look into questions on blob storage and table storage moving out will be looking into questions on compute services such as virtual machines and App services and also we'll look into auto scaling and traffic manager questions moving ahead will be looking into networking services where we look into questions about v-net and v-net peering after that we'll be looking into database services and also other domains clumped together and we'll be looking into 30 questions as a whole in this particular session also guys if you want to take up an end-to-end session on Microsoft Azure we at Intellipaat you and complete course and those details are available in the description and you can go check it out now let's begin with the session first let's look into what this Azure cloud so so what is Azure cloud service Microsoft Azure is an ever-expanding set of cloud services to help your organization meet your business challenges azure office services on a pay-as-you-go pricing model in computing web services data storage analytics etc etc so there are so many different domains in which Azure is providing services so to be very simple Azure is a cloud provider a public cloud provider as well as you can get private cloud services and hybrid cloud services from them so first of all Azure is Microsoft owned Azure is a cloud provider so after AWS Azure is the most popular cloud service in the world so when an interview ask this you can be basic as well as advanced I would suggest you just give the apt answer what exactly it is microsoft Azure is a cloud service which provides you various different services in various domains like computing web services data data storage and you can access those services via an internet device so you can access them through a laptop or a desktop or your mobile device anything with an internet connectivity you will be able to access Microsoft Azure okay so we've seen what is Azure cloud service okay guys now let's look into the second question which is how does this yo compare with AWS so first of all AWS owns 32.3% of the market share in the public cloud industry but no Azure owns only 16.2% which is just half of what AWS owns but Azure is currently the fastest growing cloud network and also it has 54 different regions in which it has availability zones but AWS has 16  availability zones across only 24 regions so regions in the sense azure geographically located regions for example as it has our region's like South India North India East us west US a central US Europe central Europe so there are so many different regions like that so like that there are 24 different regions but within those regions AWS has 69 availability zones but Azure has 54 regions it has 54 regions it has 54 availability zones and it's currently growing so this basically shows Azure is better in availability zones that is data centers because it has a wide range of data centers and various regions next comparing the services if you already know about cloud AWS and Azure then this would be easy easy to s3 RDAs our AWS services the same exact service ec2 is equal to virtual machine as your virtual machines as 3 is equal to storage blob storage RDS is equal to SQL databases in Azure so ec2 is used to launch and create server system does VM does and then s 3 and blob storage are for storing objects RDS and SQL databases can create relational databases on the cloud so you can distinguish between different services and then finally the paper hard model and paper minute model so this is one of the important difference you will have to note down because AWS does not have a paper minute model yet it charges you for the heart which you used but Azure will charge you only for the minute for example if you are running a service let's say you are running the same server Linux server in AWS in Azure for five minutes in AWS will be charged the hard for example if the hard charges in both AWS and Azure is five dollars so it would be five dollars for for sixty minutes if it's five dollars so you will be charged for the whole five dollars in AWS but in Azure that would be not the same because you will be charged per minute so if it is five dollars for the R that is 60 minutes so that will be reduced to one minute so that would be multiplied into fine so you will be charged very very very less in Azure compared to AWS if you are using services for a very less period of time so if you're using some service for two two or ten fifteen minutes then go with Azure because that will not charge you as much as AWS okay so we have seen the second question so I think you can coagulate into an answer and give it I'm just explaining you the differences but you will have to provide it more of a answer okay guys a quick info Intellipaat provides an end-to-end training course on Microsoft Azure and if you want to take it out you can check those details in the description now let's continue with the session and then comes the roles implemented in Microsoft Azure so there are three main roles the web role the worker role and the virtual machine role first the web role this gives a web solution that is the front end this is like an asp.net application while under facilitating Azure provides IAS is which is basically a web server and required services so web role provides a web solution basically it's a front end it can be a website's front end the worker load is a worker role is a solution for background service it long activities for example if you have a log activity if you want to monitor the log activity you can use a worker rule and then finally a virtual machine role so this can act both as a web and worker role and this is executed by virtual machines the virtual machine role gives the client the capacity to modify the virtual machine on which the web and worker roles are running so for example web role one leak contradicts to the website the front-end worker role one le contradicts to the business logic which is the background or the backend part so in virtual machines you can run both web role and worker role which means you can have a website running as well as a background process running so these are the three main roles which are implemented in Microsoft Azure so I think you get the point of this so basically in Azure mostly it is used to launch applications so for an application obviously there will be a web role which would be the application itself hosted and then the worker role which is background processes for example if a person wants to retrieve an image from the web site so they'll key enter the information click a button and a background code will run so that code would be your worker role and these both can be run on a virtual machine which makes it a virtual machine role so these are the three most basic roles and the next question is so this might be a question which may be asked but this does not have a certain answer I'm just giving you the three most popular and commonly used services so talk about the three principle segments of Microsoft Azure platform okay so first of all compute and storage comes by default because they are the most used compute services and storage services are the most used services in any cloud platform and then you can choose one as per your need for example you can choose databases or you can choose monitoring managing governance you can choose anything so here I have two databases for example you can tell the answer like this so the principal segments of MicrosoftAzure platform it can be basically anything but here the most commonly used services comes into the computer and storage platform and I also would say databases because every single application needs a compute needs storage and also database so for example in compute there is virtual machines app services and function apps which can be used to develop an application and also host their application with the back-end code and then there is Microsoft Azure storage where we have blob storage table storage where if we have file storage we have Azure queues so we can use all of them to store objects we can use them to store images videos audio files we can use them to store no sequel data and finally comes databases where we can still record or structural information and also there is a cosmos TV which is for no sequel and also if your application needs a analytical database we have SQL data warehouses for that purpose too so compute storage in databases I would say they are the most they are the three principal segments of Microsoft Azure platform because they provide so many different services pretty sure even though Azure system for their own benefit ok so this is the fourth question so we have seen four questions up till now so the fifth question is what is the distinction between Azure queues Azure service plus queues okay first of all storage queues and service bus queues are different so first water storage queues storage queues featuring a simple rest based or get put peak interface providing reliable persistent messaging system within and between services service bus queues are part of a broader Azure messaging infrastructure that supports queuing as well as publish or subscribe and more advanced integration patterns okay so the simplest thing you will have to know is if your application needs to store more than 80 GB of messages go with storage queues but if it means only lesser than that and it won't exceed 80 GB you can go with a service bus queue so the thing is storage cubes are mainly used to move messages between services or end-user so you can see this a rest-based get put peak interface pristine you can get a message from it you can upload or send a message through it and in service bus you can do the same but also you can integrate advanced patterns for example you can integrate a queuing system which basically filters multiple messages according to their priority and that does not come with storage queues also storage queues are very easy to use you can use it between services you can create a cube within minutes service bus is has a broader usage in Azure itself so these are the main two differences that if you want use an application for your own personal use go with storage queues if it is a bigger application which needs shortened message storing go with service bus queues so the dist the main distinction between them is storage queues are simple list based get put peak interface but service bus queues is involved with the azure messaging infrastructure itself and this supports queueing as well as normal publish and subscribe which comes with storage queues as well also you can integrate advanced integration patterns but which cannot be done in storage queues where you can filter different messages according to their priority and various other features and factors ok so the next question is what is stable storage and Microsoft Azure so Azure table storage service towards a lot of organized information Azure tables are perfect for putting away organized non-relational data it is a no sequel data store which acknowledges verified calls from inside and outside the Azure cloud so basically table storage is a no sequel data store where you can store non-relational data that's basically no sequel non-relational database ok so now what exactly is table storage first let's look into what exactly it is first of all a table is a collection of entities at record can contain numerous tables basically when you create a table you can have multiple tables or a single table and it it is a collection of entities what are entities entities is an arrangement of properties like a database row an entity can be up to one MB in size so basically an entity is an item within the table for example if it is a table for shoes and inside that every single shoe name would be a entity next comes properties a property is a name value pair every entity can incorporate up to 252 properties to store data for example let's say in entity we have three different shoe types one is adidas as well as Reebok one is Nike and in say a radius you can have 252 properties like color pipe shoe model number and so many different properties and other entity which defines that particular entity so inside the table there can be any number of entities and inside those entities there can be two fifty two different types of properties to store data so that's what Azure table storage is used for it is a service used to store a lot of organized information in which you can store non-relational data it is a no sequel data store which acknowledges verified calls from inside and outside there's Azure cloud that is you can integrate it with Azure services inside the cloud as well as third-party services from outside the cloud and table is a collection of entities entities is basically the main item inside the table and properties are the sub basically a property explains what an entity is and the entities completely explained what a table is so that's it that's what that is what table storages ok guys a quick info Intellipaat provides an end-to-end training course on Microsoft Azure and if you want to take it out you can check those details in the description now let's continue with the session the next question is what is auto scaling in Azure so what is auto scaling in Azure scaling by including extra intense instances is frequently referred to as scaling out so this is a commonly used term which is called scaling out so Azure like wise supports scaling up by utilizing bigger role rather than more role instances and auto scaling solution reduces the amount of manual work engaged in dynamically scaling an application so this is pretty simple guys so let's say you have a virtual machine which has let's say it has a website running on it now there are a lot of users using it right now but that one particular virtual machine is able to handle them so let's say there are 20 users now right now this particular virtual machine is able to handle all the 20 users and the site is not crashing but suddenly your website has gone viral and there are 200 users now your virtual machine will not be able to handle it because there are more users and the CPU utilization will go high the traffic the overload of your server will go high because of that the usage also will increase and then your website might crash so what you'll have to do you will have to again start up a virtual machine or another server once you have done that you will have to configure your website and make it run again so this will take some time until then you would have lost a lot of users so instead you can start off with using auto scaling so for example you can see the image in the right corner below in which the into the left there are two virtual machines which is routed as minimum - that basically means let's say you have a website and right now your website has two virtual machines and that is the minimum number of virtual machines and it'll never go below that even a virtual machine is let's say even a virtual machine has been terminated accidentally it'll launch one more virtual machine within a span of a minute and that will be ready for your website so now to the right side you can see virtual machines as needed and maximum is equal to 5 so the maximum number of virtual machines you will get is 5 the minimum number of virtual machines running will be 2 and there you can add or subtract 3 virtual machines for example if you have two virtual machines right now you can add three more or two more or one more or you don't need to add at all but you cannot go below number 2 or you cannot go above number 5 you can use auto scaling solution to do this for example right now you have two virtual machines and the work overload goes very very high so right now you want one virtual machine so it'll launch one virtual machine now it will monitor all of the three virtual machines again if the user count is completely increasing it'll launch one more and again if the users are increasing the traffic is overloading then again it will launch one more virtual machine so here the maximum is number five so it'll launch up to five virtual machines after that even though the user base is increasing it won't go about that you'll have to change that in the configuration for example max is equal to ten so it can launch up to ten different virtual machines okay so got it so I think you understood what exactly auto scaling is so you can explain it simply for example you can tell auto scaling solution reduces the manual work engaged in dynamically scaling an application instead we can set up an auto scaling solution in Azure where it gives you the number of required instances as such as whenever the traffic increases it will give you more instances when the traffic decreases it will reduce the number of resources being used which is also cost optimized and this will reduce your building cost so now let's look into the next question which would be what are the features of Microsoft Azure so what are the features of Microsoft Azure so there are so many different features so let's just look into three features so first Azure app services enables designers to assemble the sites utilizing various different programming languages you can use a speed or net PHP you can use Java Python and send these websites utilizing FTP or get basically you can use github to have the score and you can integrate it with Azure app services so that view itself will launch your website for you it will maintain your website for you you just have to work on your code next comes SQL databases formerly known as Azure database makes broadens and scales the application into the cloud utilizing Microsoft SQL Server so in SQL database is provided by Azure you don't need to scale out anything for example if you have set up a maximum size whenever the size of the database increases it will automatically scale the storage and also you can manually scale the compute and finally this is Microsoft's platform as a service that supports multi-level applicationson Automated deployment that is Azure is Microsoft's platform as-a-service because they are giving you a platform to work on various different services even those services like virtual machines are infrastructure as a service it comes under ias but Microsoft Azure as a whole is a platform as a service because they are giving you a platform which you can work on different cloud services so these are some features about Microsoft Azure you can talk about them so next question is what are the difference between a public cloud and a private cloud this is one of the most basic questions you can easily answer them so look at the image at the top so first of all public cloud elasticity utility pricing leverage expertise and then private cloud total control regulation flexibility so let's compare this first of all elasticity that is you can launch any number of services can go up we can go down you can have any number of users you can provide the access to users you can cut off the axis whenever you want so it's more elastic and then coming to write its total control you can mention the administrator and only they will have control over the private cloud so this basically increases security in private cloud but public cloud is widely used and also you can see leverage expertise that means if you are using Microsoft Azure as a public cloud then you will be able to leverage expertise because they have so many different security professionals working for Microsoft and they will be guarding your virtual machines because you have taken a virtual machine from Azure itself and coming to private cloud you will have to maintain monitor all of that and then comes utility pricing and regulation so utilizing the sends you only pay for what you use in private cloud you will pay for everything you have taken up and also regulation in the sense you can stop someone to access something you can stop a service overall you don't need to use a service so in private cloud you have the whole control in public cloud you have partial control ok so now let's look into the most basics of them public cloud is utilized as a service through the internet by users so anyone can use it while a private cloud is deployed within specific limits like firewall settings and it's totally overseen and checked by users dealing with it in an organization so a public cloud is used for launching applications for public use that is in user use private cloud is used mostly used for deploying applications within a specified limit for example within an organization you can launch applications so you can do that using private cloud so this is the basic differences between public and private cloud so the next question would be hybrid cloud what do you comprehend about hybrid cloud so basically a company can use both public and private cloud so a combination of them is a hybrid cloud so hybrid cloud is a blend of internal and external cloud services so internal in the sense within the organization external in the sense for users a mix of private cloud joined with the utilization of public cloud services this kind of cloud is most appropriate when you need to keep the classified information at your vicinity private cloud and consume alternate services from a public cloud for example if you have mission-critical data you can store that in the private cloud and the application itself can be running on the public cloud because the application does not have any important information and even though there's a security breach that can be nothing taken from that but your mission-critical data and code is stored in a private cloud which only you can access so this is hybrid cloud and the next question is what is a storage cable so your storage key access keys are similar to a root password for your storage account always be careful to protect your access keys use Azure key wall to manage and rotate your keys securely you can view and copy your account access keys with the azure portal PowerShell or Azure CLI the azure portal also provides a connection string for your storage account that you can copy for example if you are logging in to your storage account in Azure portal it's pretty simple to log in you can just enter you can just enter as such but if you are trying to access your storage account from power shell or Azure CLI you will have to use your storage keys so it's pretty it's basically an entry point for your storage account so you can use that also zero portal provides a connection string for the storage account that you can copy and use it in here Azure or PowerShell so to be simple it is a it is similar to a root password for your storage account and it is a key which you can use to login into your storage account to check out the storage containers like blob storage table storage within the storage account itself so it's pretty simple storage account and then comes what does Microsoft Azure traffic manager so it enables users to control the distribution of user traffic of installed Azure cloud services there are three distinctive load balancing strategies provided by Azure the manager who uses on traffic applies a routing policy to the domain name sells questions on your domain names and maps the DNS courses to the apt instances of your application so let me explain to you in simple words so first of all as your traffic manager it's a DNS based traffic to your balancer that enables you to distribute traffic optimally to services across global of your regions while providing high availability and responsiveness so basically traffic manager uses our DNS to direct client requests to the most appropriate end point on traffic routing method so basically let me explain to you this so let's say you are trying to access a website using a website's URL name now when you type that your first point of entry would be the traffic manager so once you hit that the traffic manager will use DNS and it will check to which IP address should this particular URL name is should be redirected so once when it finds that it will redirect the client request to the most appropriate service for example in Intellipaat.com we have Intellipaat.com which is the main page and Intellipaat.com slash blog so for example I am searching for  Intellipaat.com slash blog now this will go to the traffic manager once it hits the traffic it will check out the IP address for this particular URL once it gets the IP addresses it will transfer me into the blog page not the main Intellipaat dot-com page so that's what traffic manager does and it's pretty simple to use it so you can start off with traffic manager even now so you can combine traffic manager with auto scaling so that it is better to use so if you are using traffic manager without a skill basically what you do you will be able to launch and terminate multiple virtual machines as well as you'll be able to launch multiple applications in different virtual machines and connect to auto scaling groups together in which the traffic manager is the first entry point and for example in one auto scaling group there is app one in another of auto scaling group there is app two so now it hits the traffic manager if you are trying to access up to it will take you to up to if you are trying to access app one it will take you to the app one auto scaling group so this is how you can use traffic manager the next question is what is Microsoft Azure portal this is again a basic question so Microsoft Azure portal is the website which you are logging into when you are using Azure so view and manage all of your applications in one unified hub you can view your web applications your databases your virtual machines your network storage and VST projects now it is easy to keep tabs on current and projected costs so Microsoft Azure is not just for managing oriole all your applications and services it can also be used to manage your current and projected building costs so Azure portal automatically calculates your existing charges as well as it will forecast your future or monthly charge even if you are managing hundreds of resources across several applications for example if you are using only one service still it will give you the billed amount for right now and also the projected bill if you are also using hundreds of services again it will do the same thing for you regardless of the scale so Microsoft Azure a portal is the website which are using to access Microsoft Azure services that it's more than enough if you don't tell more you can tell it's a unified hub to manage all the Azure services it also provides cost management services you can say it has a different webpage for every single service you can access every single service directly from the portal itself and also manage monitor and do everything else through Azure portal itself and also you can access is your portal from any internet-connected device okay so we've seen that the next question is what is elastic pool in SQL Azure so we already saw what exactly is an SQL database so now AZure SQL database elastic pools are a simple cost effective solution for managing and scaling multiple databases that have varying and unpredictable usage 2-months databases in an elastic pool or on a single server and share a set of resources at a set price okay let me make it simple for you so right now you hope you want various databases for different applications and all these databases need to have a different set of specifications now what you can do is you can launch an elastic pool which is basically a single server with different sets of resources within it you can launch multiple databases and you can specify the required set of resources for a particular database within the elastic pool itself you can launch any number of databases within that server and how much that server can handle and all of the databases is shared will use shared resources and the price for that will be the same even though you are using any number of databases so let's say you can have 10 databases within that elastic pool or you can have 5 databases or you can have only one database but you'll be charged the same because you are sharing the same number of resources across all the databases so this is elastic pool ok guys a quick info Intellipaat provides an end-to-end training course on Microsoft Azure and if you want to take it out you can check those details in the description now let's continue with the session next is what is Azure SQL database so an SQL is just an approach to get associated with cloud services where you can store your database into the cloud if you already know what SQL database is for example my sequel for a sequel or ms SQL database you will understand this easily because it is basically these same relational database on your local system hosted on a cloud system and given a remote access to you so you can tell it pretty simply SQL Azure database is a database server running in the Azure data center and to which you're given remote access to so that you can access that SQL database Microsoft SQL Azure has a similar component of SQL Server that is it provides high accessibility versatility and security in the core Microsoft Azure SQL database has an element it makes backups of each active database automatically so this feature does not come with a local database because it does not take backup it has only one storage where the data is actually stored and if that is lost your data is lost but in Microsoft Azure SQL databases it's not the case but you can enable automatic database backups so if your database is active and new data is coming and it will automatically back it up so even though your database has been terminated you can use the backup to launch a database with the same existing data set so this is Azure SQL databases now let's look into the next question which is what are the different types of storage areas in Microsoft Azure so there is blobs there is stable storage there is queues and there are still more but you can talk about three maximum so there is also five storage which is basically a shared access file storage so you can also talk about that if you want but right now I will be looking into blob table and queues so queues we already looked into now we'll just look into blobs on tables even table storage was a separate question so you can also answer that so first of all what is blog so blob is the most commonly used a storage type in Azure so the full form of blob would be binary large objects so you can see that BL OB which is basically binary large object blobs so blobs are a component for storing a lot of content or binary data you can store pictures audio-visual documents you can store video you can store any type of data they can scale up to 200 terabytes and can be acquired by utilizing REST API very very simple to start off with blob storage we can create a storage account and create a blob container in which you can upload images videos documents anything you want you can store any type of binary data within blob storage so that is one of the main area in Microsoft Azure next comes table storage which is a non relational data store where you can store organized information and also you can store them using a format which is table entity and with an entity you can have properties so that we saw next is Q the sole target of a queue is to empower communication among the web and worker role instances the help and storing messages that may be accessed by a customer so I stole cues can be used to connect multiple services as well as services with the end user so these are three main storage areas one more is a file storage which is basically a shared storage access which you can use to connect the same storage to multiple virtual machines so every single user in every single virtual machine will be able to access the same data store which will save you a lot of storage as well as cost next question is what is the concept of blob storage I explain to you what exactly is blob so let me just go into that more so blob as told again it is binary large objects and includes text files images audios and videos Azure blob is a service that stores massive and structured data that can be accessed from any place via protocols like HTTP or HTTPS so how does this work how can you access these objects using HTTP HTTP so it's pretty simple whenever you upload an object like image or audio into the blob storage it will have a URL so it will be providing a URL and you can use that URL to access that particular object for example if I am uploading an image that image will have a URL for that image itself now you can use that URL to access that particular image so how will you access that using protocols like HTTP or HTTPS so now what else you can use Azure blobs for storing data for disaster recovery backup and archiving also storing files for shared access shared accesses in the sense if you upload an object and you have a link for it you can share that link with multiple users so that they all can use that particular blob storage assess our shared storage so that can happen also you can use it for disaster recovery that is you can store data in different regions in blob storage itself and use it for backup and then also archiving data so this is blob storage now let's dig into the next question so now this question is what is Azure DevOps in Microsoft Azure so if you are already familiar with DevOps methodologies then this would be easier to understand if you're not I'll explain to you what exactly is DevOps in a few sentences so first of all the DevOps is not a tool it is a methodology which companies are follow and implement in their software development lifecycle to automate the entire lifecycle so azure devops is not a methodology it is a service you may be confused by the name but DevOps is the methodology but Azure DevOps is a DevOps service provided by Azure and it is developed by the Microsoft team it was previously called as VST s or visual studio team services Azure DevOps provides easy automation by having predefined build options for the deployment of applications for example if you are trying to launch an angular application it already has build options for it it has NPM packages in build you can have a build you can basically create a build in a matter of minutes for example if you are also launching a java application it has maven build option you can use that to build that application so that's why they are saying it provides you easy automation and also free to find predefined build options and finally it also monitors you tools and it uses monitor to monitoring tools to monitor your application or your project which you have launched within Microsoft Azure DevOps okay so as Azure DevOps has various different tools so let me explain to you those tools so one tool is Azure repose which is a repository like github so it's pretty similar it's basically the same and then comes your pipelines pipelines is the tool which you use to implement a CI CD pipeline a CI CD pipeline is the one which you use to automate the software life cycle and then comes test plants which is basically used to test the application and then comes Azure boats which is a Kanban board which is basically like JIRA where you can implement work items you can implement sprints and then finally you have Azure artifacts where you can store the packages like NPM you get in the same place so that it is easier to access them also finally you get in Azure dashboard where you can access and also create and launch widgets which will be helpful for your application for example you can see how many bills have been succeeded how many I have failed how much time it is taking to build a particular project how many times it has been deployed and how many users are using our application right now so all these widgets can be used in Azure DevOps so you've seen that the next question is what is Azure app service we already discussed this but so I'll explain to you once again so to be very simple Azure app service is a completely a managed service provided by Microsoft Azure so within Azure Azure app service it's a completely managed platform as a service not infrastructure as a service but a path it is a path offering for proficient developers that can raise a rich arrangement of abilities to web mobile and integration services so if a developer wants to just concentrate on the code which is developing and doesn't want to manage the servers and the other side of it that is the backend part of it so what he can do he can opt your app service where he can launch one and he can just upload a scored Inter's Azure app service which will take care of provisioning servers uploading the code with this server and also serving that website and also provide you and URL which you can use to look into the website so you can do all of this using Azure app service and you don't need to manage anything Azure will manage everything for you it will not a stole it launched servers it will also monitor and manage them for you and if you want anything else if you want to scale it up again you have an option for that if you want to look into the server which it has launched again you have a shell option for that mobile applications in-Azure app servers offer a very adaptable universally accessible mobile application development platform for entreprise developers and system integrators that can raise rich set of capacities to mobile engineers so basically using as your app services you cannot just launch websites you can also launch mobile applications and they are very adaptable and universally accessible mobile application development platform for example you might be using Android studio or Xcode so in this you will be able to launch both of them and they will run successfully so next we'll look into cmdlets in Azure so it's it's a pretty simple answer so cmdlets is a command basically it's a PowerShell command and this is utilized as a part of the PowerShell environment so CMD let's commandlets or summoned by the Windows PowerShell to automate the scripts which are in the command line for example you have created a script now you want to automated script you can go with command let Windows PowerShell runtime additionally invokes them automatically through windows powershell aps you can also automate cmdlets commands which will automate other scripts using powershell api's so to be pretty simple cmdlets is a lightweight command which you can use in the Power Cell environment and it is used to automate scripts for example if you want to launch virtual machine out of particulars time or if you want to monitor a virtual machine at 5:00 p.m. in the evening every single day you can launch that script and you can automate it using cmdlets and it will run that script every every day at 5:00 p.m. okay so the next one is Microsoft as your scheduler so as your scheduler enables you to invoke activities for example calling hits et bien endpoints or presenting a message on a storage queue on any schedule with schedule o you make jobs in the cloud that dependably call services both inside and outside of a zero and execute jobs on-demand on a routinely repeating schedule or assign them honor for a future date so in the name itself you can understand Microsoft as your scheduler so it basically schedules certain things for you but what does it schedule it schedules jobs on the cloud so it can be with the nozzle or outside of Azure and as mentioned it will execute those jobs on demand and it can be done on a repeating scale that is for example every day or every week or you can assign them for a future date to run only once so that you can do using Microsoft as your scheduler for example it can call an HTTP endpoints or it can present a message on a storage queue on any schedule so you can use the scheduler for any cells on Azure or outside of zero so it's pretty simple it is an explainable mine by name itself so to be simpler you can tell this Microsoft Azure scheduler is a service which you can use to schedule a certain task in Microsoft Azure or outside of Microsoft Azure to execute a job on demand which can be executed repeatedly or it can be set to a few to date for execution only once so the next question is how can you create an hdinsight cluster in Azure so let me explain to you and in a very simple way so you can tell this because this is an interview you will be asked questions you will be able to answer them with words so to make an HT inside cluster first fall you'll have to open as your portal then click on new you can select data services and you can click on HDNet or you can just search hitch D inside and get into it so once you get into it you will have multiple options you will have Hadoop you will have HBase and storm and more options as well so Hadoop is the default and native execution of our Apache Hadoop and HD inside provides you Hadoop as the default option and then comes HBase which is an Apache open source no sequel database based on Hadoop that gives random access and solid consistency for a lot of unstructured data storm as such it is a distributed fault tolerant open source computation system that enables you to process data in real time so the thing is I'm not going to explain how dope HBase and storm right now I'm just going to explain to you what is history inside so HD insight is an analytic service which you can use to launch hadoop on the azure cloud or other Hadoop ecosystem services like HBase storm or spark on your cloud so to launch hitched insights it's pretty simple but to work with it it is a little tough so to launch HT inside you will just have to go to the HTML cluster and you can choose the service which you want and you can launch it so change side again it's an analytic service and you can launch the big data or analytic service which you want from it next question is what is text analytics API in as your mission so let me put it simply first of all text analytics API s-- comes under cognitive services so api the application program interface so this particular API is for text analytics which can be used to search a particular word or it can be used for keyword mining ok now let me let us just read this once the API can be used or utilized to analyze unstructured content for tasks such as sentiment analysis and keyphrase extraction sentiment sentiment analysis in the sense let's say you have a complete page of content now you want to see the sentiment of that content whether the statement is happy or sad or neutral so you can check out that using various keys and you can enter those words into the API so that when it runs it will check whether it is positive or negative so you can see it as a numeric score between 0 and 1 and when it comes near 1 it is highly positive and it when it comes to near zero it is highly negative sentiment so that you can see this for sentiment analysis and keyphrase extraction in the sense if you have a very huge document and if you want to check whether this particular key phrase comes inside it and you can use the text analytics API to check out the entire document the upside of this API is that another new model need not be planned and prepared the user just needs to bring the data and call the service to get the sentiment results so they are telling that the best part of this API is that you don't need to call another service to run this API instead you just have to bring the data set and call this API to run on the data set and get the sentiment results immediately so I think you got it it is a text analytics API mainly used for tasks like sentiment analysis and keyphrase extraction you have two numeric scores 0 & 1 near zero this negative and near 1 it is highly positive it's basically sentiment and the upside is you don't need to call any other service you can directly call this API and upload a data set and it will give you the sentiment results next question is what is my great tool so again in the name itself you can get this answer migration a migration from the on through my set up to the cloud or from the cloud to the aunt through my setup this is a central hub of tools to discover asses and migrate workloads to Azure so you can migrate any type of workload enters your so it provides support for key migration scenarios across servers data databases web applications and virtual desktops it saves costs and migrate efficiently with free tooling and as your copped optimization so you can use them as your my great tool to migrate databases or servers or web applications from your on through my set up to the azure cloud seamlessly so for example if want to migrate your database you will have to provide the details like the end point then you'll have to provide the username and password and then the destination would be a database you can provide the detailed software as your database and once you click start it will migrate the data from the on through - database into pairs your database and it's very very simple to start with so this is basically as your migrated you can easily explain this with two or three sentences and we've come to the final question which is what is your service level agreement first of all the SLA ensures that when you send two or more role instances for each role access to your cloud service will be maintained not less than 99.9% of the time additionally identification and reconnection activities will be started 99.9 percent of the time when the roles instance procedure isn't running so let me explain to you SLA in simple words it's an agreement in which azure tells you that this particular service will be running for this amount of time so for example if you are using a service for 10 minutes as it provides you SLA stating that your application will run 99.9 percent of the time in that 10 minute period so your application can go down only for a point zero one percent that's very very less so like that as you will provide you if you are using a free trail service they don't mention an SLA because it's your free trail and they don't give you any benefit for you but if you have a paid as your account if you are paying every single month they will provide you an SLA for every single service which will mention that this particular service will run for this amount of time so for storage it's basically high for example it would be 99.9999 percent of the time it will be all we always up it will never go down so SLA is a statement which tells you this particular service will stay up for this amount of time and it will not go down for example if you're using it for one hour it will stay up for 99% of the time and it may go for one percent of the time it's not that it will go it may go so this is your s so we've come to the last question of this session guys I hope you understood all of the questions which we've taught okay guys a quick info in telepods provides an end-to-end training course on Microsoft SEO and if you want to take it out you can check those details in the description okay guys we'll come to the end of the session and I hope this session was helpful and informative for you if you have a doubt please leave a comment below and allowed to help you out thank you
