 hello thanks everyone for joining us today welcome to the kickoff of our new webinar series the convergence of wetland Science and Technology my name is Mike Connors I'm the director of customer success at eco bot before we begin I want to announce that this is going to be the first in a series of webinars that we're planning in response to so much interest that we received from both participants and the panelists that we have today so today we're going to introduce six very relevant case studies on topics such as drones GPS receivers GIS software and more we have with us today a diverse panel of experts consisting of scientists technologists project managers regulators and consultants and thanks so much again to each of you for being with us to kick this off today so in the hour that we have planned we're really only going to be scratching the surface so for future webinars in this series we're gonna dive deeper into each topic so we'll look at multiple case studies in each topic area in the future and have a smaller topic specific panel and this will allow you as participants more opportunities to participate via question-and-answer and conversation with the panelists directly so to get started I'm gonna introduce our featured speaker Jeremy Shea we chief scientific officer at eco Bob Jeremy Snitch lies in the sensitive ecology and environment of our planet from combining earth sciences and tech raising capital and running successful businesses to protecting thousands of acres of untouched wilderness as an entrepreneur ecologist botanist environmental consultant and executive edit tech startup he has over 16 years of project project management experience in the Americas South Pacific Middle Eastern Europe he's passionate and devoted to projects that enable sustainable economic growth dovetailed with the conservation of the world's natural resources and indigenous rights he's a problem solver with an innate to recognize patterns socially as well as ecology ecologically geologically and economically and how they can be how they can either be amplified or tempered as necessary Jeremy works in the interchange between people and sensitive habitats via wetland delineation x' tiene surveys biological inventories botanical inventories he is aia for PSD applications 404 401 permits and more and has also been heavily involved as an expert witness for sensitive and at-risk projects jeremy take away man sometimes I feel myself turning red when I'm hearing a bio like that and part of me is just like and then what I'd rather do is just be out in the wilds catching fish and cooking them over a fire and maybe doing some bow hunting etc but maybe some of you are in that that same boat as well so definitely looking forward to getting back out into the mountains more frequently here in the near future so yeah thanks for that opening Mike and first and foremost wanted to thank Kim one of the women on our panel here in the society front well and scientists who helped initiate this concept you know we took something that was just a one-off that we that we grew together for a society for wetland scientists webinar and now kicking off into this series which we're very excited about based on the level of interest that we've had in the subject matter so so today I'm excited to briefly share a little bit of my background my road to the integration convergence of wetland Science and Technology and also you know in conservation but then to actually take that dive into our specific case studies and so see how I can do a change in the slides here perfect so hopefully you can see the whole screen I know there's some different options and settings from from your viewing side as to what you can look look at these are amazing panelists that have come together for this weapon and look forward to having those very specific webinars diving in a little bit more deeply in future months so thank you again everyone for for joining this discussion today so I'm gonna go ahead and start off here and I want to start with this quote from 19th century English Quaker and writer William Pollard I believe that we are in a critical moment not only in our lives but in history we're at a significant Nexus while most of the rest of the world is just now waking up to the fact that in the 21st century we are still a part of biology and we're still connected to the earth that we as scientists have a really vital role in helping to interpolate and ascend biological data to bring a voice to the voiceless and put that into a location where that can be received because otherwise Humanity is most likely going to continue to divorce itself from the very ship that sustains us our earth and I also believe that we can help shape the future while maintaining our scientific integrity continuing to promulgate conservation preservation long term ecosystem research and management and also to sync that with intelligent responsible planning and growth our climate is changing an invitation to you all can we adapt so this is what we're going to talk about in the next 25 minutes or so we're going to look very briefly at my road so you can get an idea of where this this whole concept came from talk about the importance of digitizing data that we're going to jump directly into some of our case studies that were we're going to be looking at today and then we're going to look at importance of workflow in the marriage of Technology and wetland science and then finally just kind of ink it out with what some of the near future of where wetland science and tech may be going so all of you I think are pretty pretty comfortable and aware of these three Hawks which are essentially the federal walls that shape our industry the organizations on the right are a lot of the federal and state agencies that have helped to shape me in terms of working with them either as a contractor or subcontractor or collaborating on projects and so it's these collaborations that have helped to shape me as a scientist and many of you as well and so here I just wanted to join just a very brief touch into my own history so when I when I came out of school I started working with the University of North Carolina at the Highlands Biological Station stationed there for two years we did a lot of work with endangered species propagation natural areas management and then doing inventories I got into the consulting field back in my home city of Cincinnati Ohio with environmental quality management worked there for two years wetlands teeny ecological restoration and then started my own company Munakata environmental muñeca is a Cherokee word for these mountains that we live in here in the southern Appalachian Mountains where I continued in that vein of working with threatened and endangered species with various restoration projects as well as a lot of large scale wetlands assessments and during that time I also was invited to sit on the board for the cloud forest conservation initiative where we have helped to protect 40,000 contiguous acres of primordial cloud forest and the highlands of Guatemala so now that's protected in perpetuity that's a volunteer gig that I'm involved with anybody ever wants to come down for a bio blitz we usually get out of March so it is about a year and a half ago that I launched eco MOT with my co-founder Lee Lance and that kind of brings us to where we are today taking all this science and launching someone who's very biocentric I'm the Eco into a technologically driven portion of the world - so convergence of wetland science in fact we had fun putting this image together it really speaks volumes as to what the importance of our role as scientists is in terms of digitizing data is critical to understand that in the microclimate of each of our individual lives or perhaps in our in our organizations that we work with it's easy to become fiercely independent and to remain so but one of the things I love about our community is the ability to collaborate across organizations across companies you see that in the very panel that we have today we have a lot of people have worked together a lot of people that have been in one moment on in a competitive edge with one another yeah at the same time still have the capability of coming back together to working together I love our community and there's one thing that I've learned through those collaborations both in working with wetland scientists and natural resource scientists to collaborate on larger efforts but also with something such as the table force that it takes it takes a team of people of multiple different angles and looking at a particular potential problem or an area that needs some discovery to be able to tend to tease out a better solution that's going to be a conglomerate of everyone's viewpoints and I think that it's really to understand that our responsibility I believe is to translate our biological and the a biological observations from the field into a digital format because right now the world is moving in that direction Koba 19 is projected that further along the path what is happening is if something does not show up in a digital format somewhere it's not going to have a voice in policy it's not going to have a voice in decision-making it's not going to have a voice in our human Council if you will so I feel like it's really important for us to take a look at how we're digitizing our data and bringing that up into a place so looking at digitizing data from a macro scale how does the digitisation digitization of data allow us to look at macro scale planning whether it's statewide nationwide global looking how to be more prepared for climate change for shifts in storm and weather patterns for those of you who live on the coast this is very alive for you for those of us who grew up or lived in flood plains it's very alive for us how can we track and plan and implement things from that macro scale perspective but then also the importance of the micro scale like looking at our specific projects are specific watersheds or the Pacific specific preserves or conservation areas that you are involved in protecting or promulgating the long-term integrity of so that we still have these gems on our planet and in our communities that we can interact with and learn from and so it's really important from that micro scale from even just you as a scientist observing in the field what you're collecting taking that data and putting it up into a format that other people can see who maybe they can't get out to that site maybe they don't have the time to get out to the site and really critical at this time in the game so let's go ahead and take a dive in here so this is what I thought tak and what Ling's was supposed to look like I grew up in this of course I thought that I needed an r2 unit to follow me around do all the calculations my co-founder reminded me that the computer I in my pocket which I didn't even know as a computer my smartphone was actually more powerful than the computer that NASA used to land units on the moon is fascinating to me and what most people using it for sending each other text messages a little goofy images like here we have these amazing powerful tools in our pockets ready to go and so believe that it's really important that we utilize the tools that we have in this convergence and welcome science and tech to morph with what is happening in the time so that we can make better observations process model data better and access that data and thus influence natural resource management planning policy etc and so today we're going to take a look at and hear from some of our panelists as well how drones GPS receivers GIS software data collection apps and other attack is shaping our industry but also is being shaped by our industry so let's take a look at our first group so drones so again remembering that we're going to be talking about this from a top level and we're going to go deeper in to these conversations without coming webinars so each of these can be kind of served from that from this level so drones I still call them drones and now most people are calling they're like the new term is you know UAV unmanned aerial vehicle it's still a drone that's easier it for me to say and it makes more sense and I think that you know many companies including you know Daniel when Emma's company whose panel today they are offering drones as a service to help to minimize the level of effort the level of cost that it takes to monitor wetlands to monitor impacts to monitor assessments of wetlands with with drones essentially there's three types there's a look the wings type that look like airplanes you've got your quad copters which I'm most familiar with which is what is in the photograph that your look here then there's also the old-school version of using balloons and blimps and I know some people still use this I remember at SWS conference this past year someone had made a presentation of all these tiles they put together from a balloon awesome but essentially what drones allow for is controllable access to high resolution optics photos near infrared thermal censoring lidar data beeped out and look at what you have in the field so let's let's take a look at the case study that I'm going to look at so all of these case studies that I'm going to present to you are specific to projects that I've been involved with because that is what what I can speak to most confidently so again we'll jump into these more with future webinars but so I'm most familiar with the DJI phantom sr6 own one of those that's we have that as part of the club force conservation initiative for this particular project we are using it to do aerial imagery to look out potential impacts to the edges of this primordial cloud forest to see where the actual extent of the old-growth forest is I'm not sure if you all can see my my arrow when I'm moving that around but in the lower picture you can see in the upper right corner you can see where the impacts of some milpa style farming are where they do the burns and growing corn beans etc and so this is this you know we have really enjoyed the utilization of this and so again we will dive deeper into this in the near future but this is one that I can speak highly for GPS receivers most people in this industry are already using some type of GPS receivers but just like smartphones they change every few months every few years and there's always new things coming up I grew up with grew up I have been mostly in the space of using like a lot of the geo 7000 series with Trumbull for a lot of the wetland delineation and natural resource study stream assessments that I have been involved with the with with GPS receivers I think the most important thing to keep in mind from the top level you essentially have four grades of receivers you've got your military government grade then you've got your survey grade then you have your mapping grade and then you have your consumer recreation grade you have varying levels of accuracy from supposedly sub centimeter for government military down to the consumer grade being twenty to thirty meter accuracy however one of the new waves of what we're exploring now in this industry and what I've been able to play with a lot our GPS receivers that are paired to smartphones and so that's what we're going to look at is a case study today so I've been using the tremble AR one for about a year and a half out in the field if my talking image is not the way you can see about how big the image is up in the upper right corner there's no interface the interface has to pair via bluetooth to a piece of hardware so I pair it to my iPhone instead of down in the lower the lower left picture that's actually a screenshot from Eco bot so I've got the receiver repaired to my phone and then the data is actually importing into Eco bot so that I can present that data as such been getting fairly fairly good accuracy with the with the r1 pretty excited about it supposed to get submetering accuracy usually getting if I've got pretty good satellite coverage usually getting you know within 10 centimeters to a half of a half a meter if I haven't checked up on by my GNSS in point sometimes it can be a little off but you know like five to ten meters which is still pretty accurate still learning how to refine that and so I think that Darren's gonna give us an opportunity to take a look at that later on in a panel discussion GIS software GIS software has revolutionized our ability to portray a story to be able to convey data that's on the ground macroscale or even just project specific scale and then distribute that or disseminate that to tell a very simple story can be conveyed very quickly I know that Megan Lange from US Fish and Wildlife Service was talking about how she used to just send out paper maps to everyone that was a part of what National Inventory used to be to where it is now we get fairly granular data and so I have been over the years I've been using an arcmap prior to that I was using USGS maps that I was Xerox in and then sharpie and my project area I'm sure some of you have been around long enough to have done that as well about a year and a half migrated over to ArcGIS Pro really enjoy working with arcgis pro it took me a little bit of time to ramp up you know kind of learning the new toolbox if you will but once i was comfortable with the toolbox it takes me a matter of minutes what used to take me summer hours you know and scale that to a project hours might be a small project like this where you're talking about 40 or 60 acres versus you know 4,000 acre project which might take days you know swimming that down so really looking at major efficiency gains there as well and so Daniel Marton is here to share with us any any some conversations around that so now next of course you know is data collection apps as well as other field applications things that you can utilize in the field for or help you with plant identification and things like that the main thing with data collection apps is that there's variant types you've got your consumer grade versus professional grade so consumer grade might be something that may even have some peer support events such as like a naturalist but it's still very consumer based versus something like like ego buy which is very specifically tailored to a scientific workflow and then there's also the difference between the shelf software versus custom software so off-the-shelf software would be something where you can kind of formulate your own utilization something like fulcrum or survey one two three or something that you can do that is more custom built such as wet form or echo-y etc smartphones are already in our pockets everyone's carrying them in the field it just makes sense to continue to collect data in this way to create some more of that efficiency so also so so specific case study with eco bot I think without getting too far into the details in the interest of time just looking at the maximum amount of time savings that can be created by using something like this that allows for such a high automation of calculations and taking all of the observations that you have collected in the field and then putting them into a compiled report and then having the integration with with ESRI software in order to map and project that so let's take a look at some of the new tools coming up some of the things that I'm pretty excited about and I know some of the other more you know macro scale interested folks are getting excited about is some of the machine learning and AI tools that are starting to become available and for monitoring wetlands monitoring potential impacts over time and also doing some modeling that based on that machine learning artificial intelligence and again looking at how you know what's the difference between augmenting a scientist's existing workflow and then what adds on to or what can reduce and create more efficiency so our first case study that I want to look at here we have we have Jessica Norris representing upstream this is a project where we're looking at a large-scale mitigation area looking at making sure that things are in compliance making sure that in terms of vegetative cover in terms of where water is pulling on a given site and being able to model that and so pretty excited about where some of this stuff is going case study is actually an up-and-coming case study that some of us on this call are hoping to jump in and do a case study collaboratively this summer there's a new tool for that called the months of capture which is purportedly designed to be able to give us our our readings for our soil colors I'm not sure that it'll work just because of the complications especially when you deal with mottled soils and Glade so in those reduced soils but we'll see what happens I'm excited to kind of play with it otherwise I don't mind still using the cards but just again kind of giving you a prompt of where some things are coming from the tech side and I guess it rains to see whether this makes sense for us as scientists to utilize as well so I just pause here again very top level what we're we touched into here we'll be launching into more of that in the in the next up and coming webinars because if we want to focus on our amazing panel that we have here today but now that we've reviewed some of these top level technologies that are starting to become core to wetland science this point I think it's really important to understand for me it's very important to understand the relationship of why it's important to build this tech from inside of the industry and not from someone creating it from outside and then force-feeding it to us I think there's nothing more than I personally can find disconcerting than to have outside an outsider telling insiders what and how to do something whether it is planners disk looting stakeholders in conservation projects or if it's policy makers denouncing scientific facts or if it's technocratic force-feeding a software hardware that does not sink in with our current workflow it's just going to add more to what we're doing so let's take a look at how work like one example of how workflow and wetland delineation works out so again technology to me should make our jobs easier we want try to force fit that plus sign through the triangle we want our water scope of work not to become more complicated but to become easier more efficient more effective in the telling of a story in the telling of in the translation of scientific and planning information into a form that is going to be audible as to to to laypeople so you know it's really critical especially for those of us that are still working in the field that we have tools that allow us to work offline we don't always have a data connection when we're out in the field and it's also really critical to have that integration of mapping and modeling and lookup tools built into it so the main thing that I feel like it's important about the way we're doing this webinar the way we're saying at this panel the way we work as scientific organisations from the nonprofit side to the for-profit side is that we listen we listen to what is needed what is being asked for from our from our peers and that we take that in in mind as we're shaping and building and creating things whether it's tools or policy or new teams for taking on new challenges or solutions you know we can't just charge ahead and expect everyone to to get in line like really thinking about the ecosystem that we exist in a scientist so one thing I'm excited from from the EcoPOD platform to is to announce that as of today we're releasing to the App Store our version 2 which is going to have all the our integration our first level of integration with Ezzor ease mapping tools that will work offline available to all of our customers and partners and so very excited for that so you can get that on the the App Store here within the next 24 hours at least that's what I was told before we were getting on the call so just to wrap this up where's this all going our jobs or livelihoods at risk maybe kovat 19 might be slowing things a little bit down but no our jobs have become even more important at this point in time in the game it's our jobs to interpret patterns biological a biological data and to convert that into digital formats that we can make better decisions going forward it's not it's not a matter of if it's a matter of when when the next pandemic comes or when the next major policy comes such as changes to the waters of the United States rules so my last my last slide here is just to talk a little bit about you know where things might be going this is a world war two era cipher machine on the far right this was used to send codes back and forth by the US and allies during World War two and so one of the things that's also really critical in this at this point in the game of well in science and technology is that we don't get so far ahead that a lot of the organizations that were serving in helping to maintain the very laws that helped to sustain our natural resources that they would fall behind and not be oh so right now we create this great level of efficiency some of these organizations are looking to ways in the near future to be on their side to actually be on the other side of that cipher machine to receive that raw data and then turn it into something digital that they can utilize as well so that efficiency can be retained or gained by our government as well so I want to do thank you all for joining us for this portion for listening to my little share here for the last half an hour especially want to thank the Eco MOT team for everybody into trying to help make this happen obviously we're not making any money doing this this is part of our give back to our community which we're super excited about and again thank you to all the panelists who are now going to be joining me for this next half of our time together in our discussions so again amazing amazing team of people I wish we were on the same room together looking forward to seeing you all somewhere I'm taking you out of dinner we're gonna have some fun together I don't know where it's going to be maybe it's going to be like southern tip Illinois like right in the center in the United States wherever I can travel about the same distance anyway again thank you all for jumping on the clock here and I am going to close up my screen share and then just would like to invite all the parents you know what it makes sense to take yourself off of you hopefully everyone in the viewing audience can can see all their lovely faces are just images coming through but anyway it's very excited so our first our first discussion areas around the docking tack and workflow and so our first question is how has how is code of 19 the pandemic how has it impacted your business or your organization's use adoption of adopting and existing and emerging technologies and how do you suppose that will inspire further innovation and developments in the future so I'm going to start with amber down in the Gulf hey so I think I missed all of the chaos of the pandemic a really positive by-product has been you know innovation and that my company has you know used this time to kind of catapult us into using this you know different forms of technology in order to do two things better interact with our clients and also collect data in a more efficient and safe way and and it's interesting because previously I think my company was a little shy to jump into some of these technologies and kovetz actually allowed us to sort of forced us into to this new experience and I have a couple of examples that I'll share briefly one have a compliance monitoring project down here in Louisiana my inspector has been literally you know taking his notes filling out of his inspection form you know using a pen and a piece of paper and the clients always been shy to accept sort of new technological ways of collecting that data just from a cost efficiency standpoint but because things have been so it's been so critical to keep my my sub safe recently we're gonna be transitioning to it's called survey one two three four arcgis which is going to allow us to collect that data real time without needing any you know remote satellite he can and it'll immediately get to us so it'll be happening quicker and more efficiently and this is just you know one example others being you know that we're using WebEx now in order to visit with clients which is you know more cost efficient way to engage and absolutely we will continue to use this this type of technology even after covetous is behind us so yeah it's exciting times I think a really positive byproduct of kind of a chaotic sake situation you know thank you yeah how about you nonprofit side right I'll kind of talk about it from the society wetland scientist side I'm the chair of the webinar committee and it was kind of interesting timing with having Jeremy having done our last webinar but mostly I want to focus on you know how its impacted our communication and just kind of our connection and with other our wetland community and SWS started our webinars back in 2015 and we've been using the go to weather platform and we've been recently talking about ways that we could improve the program and this kind of catapulted us into having to figure out ways to do this connection with the members and others that we're interested in wetland science and so we are doing a number of different things but we are switching to the zoom platform which everybody is becoming much much more comfortable with because we've been doing this during the time where we've been in isolation or a stay at home and I have been teleworking for six weeks now but so all the things that I am working on with SWS are going through now we have a zoom platform for that for our webinars also SWS as an organization is trying to adjust to the fact that we won't be having our annual meeting this year whether it be postponed or canceled and so there's talk about how we can still try to connect during that time you know we're talking on the webinar committee how how we can make you get that connection and so I think that that's kind of changed things that we think that we were kind of iffy about we've gone headlong into them because we had to I know a lot of times when there's new technology I'm like yeah I'm good I know how to do it the old way I really need the new way and then if I'm forced into it I say you know this was way better and more efficient and so I think that that is really one of the the big things is being able to connect and using these different platforms that have kind of cattle to this into it workwise as I work for a state agency and we were using Microsoft teams available to us before never really did it because we didn't have to and now we are relying on it all the time teleworking so we're doing teams meetings and it's actually really useful I was actually doing ArcGIS and NV today with the co-worker of mine and he letting me control do the controls and kind of giving me a little tutorial so it's it's amazing the kind of things that we can do thank you for asking great thank you how about you from association saying yeah well hi these are Shirley strange times for sure but yeah I'm gonna I've got a little bit of what Kim said in the sense that we have had to look into new ways to communicate and conduct meetings and we've been doing zooming a lot learning a lot about that but the other thing we talked about too was how to kind of keep engaged with the organization keep it engaged and so we have thought about doing webinars and we haven't specifically done it yet but we've got some scheduled we worked with the water resource Research Institute here in Raleigh they have an annual conference every March which didn't happen but we approached them and said we'd love to work with you to maybe schedule some of the papers especially the ones were interested in was the wetlands papers we've been a sponsor of that conference for about three years now so they said hey that's not a bad idea and so it's it's working they've done one session that wasn't specifically to wetlands but we're gonna have to well in sessions coming up the end of May and June and so that's good you know that's a good way to kind of keep the organization visible and our supporters more engaged another example is that we did get a on the monitoring side which I could never seem to get out of my life and probably don't really want to we did get a grant to start a citizen science volunteer wetland monitoring program and with kovat 19 it did pretty much got stopped in his tracks we never we we got a certain point but we never got to the are start doing the field work that we needed to do and things like that but it has gotten me and others thinking about how we might do some things differently like more remote sensing and greater use of maybe drones we have talked about doing drugs just because there'd be fun for sure but yeah we've been talking about doing drone fly over sincere how we can use that data and so forth and then the other thing too just one more thing is that I know when I work for the state we collected a huge amount of wetland data from 200 sites across the state state and its vegetation data soil data Sam phibian data's macro invertebrate date or hydrology data and one of the things we can never really do is analyze the day in any reasonable way because we had must get ready start on the next grant before we could actually get there so we just ended up summarizing things a little bit more and I take some real data you know it's sort of AI kinds of tools to look at the data and pick out patterns and trends and things like that would be really great to consider and here I go collected more monitoring data again so think about thank you great thanks Rick so you know things are changing and shifting so I guess the next thing I'd like to oppose is you know how how does power companies and organizations adapting their workflow in management around changes in technology so I thought maybe we'd start with with Megan from US Fish and Wildlife and that's an excellent question Jeremy and I have a lot to say but I'm gonna have to limit myself because and to be why I of course has been around for over 40 years and so we've seen a lot of technological change so in the beginning we had an army of folks that were drawing lines using pens on mylar overlays looking at analog aerial photography and then of course now we have folks working digitally with digital imagery sometimes it's satellite imagery and they're working within a GIS environment we used to be limited to having individuals check fern for quality now we have automated verification tools we used to be limited to folks using pieces of paper out in the field and and now we've got our iPads and we've got collector and we've got survey one two three and we're completely geared up in the field we have changed not just the way we operate but the types of ancillary data that we use we use base symmetry the map so that's usually the aerial photographs or the fine special resolution multispectral satellite data but in terms of the ancillary data you know we used to use stereo pairs and now we use lidar data and so things have changed quite a bit and I think that the quality of our data is improved and the speed at which we create the data has improved but we still don't have the magic button you know it still is not a purely automated process we still need those we still need those people to to create our Maps partially because our classification system is just so detailed so we are working to increase automation but we are still very much a paired manual automated production shop that does that cover some of the bases Jeremy yeah that's that's great I mean yeah we're gonna have a whole nother conversation at some point for sure but thank you Megan let's go over to Scott from the consulting side yeah definitely from the consulting side just in the last few years alone has been been a huge we used to go to having paper maps for everything similar to what Megan was saying is everything you went out there with was your soil mapping your nwi map being everything was in your hand you were sketching things and then going back into the office well now with a lot of collector and survey 1-2-3 and things like that and iPad I can have five or six different crews at the same time you have all your due diligence right there in your hand things that you had to do a lot before and after which cuts down on a lot of time in the office especially if you're very fast-paced and you have people all over different states working and now with cloud-based products where you can sync your data instantly so project managers can capture and see what you're doing offer up and maybe catch mistakes and I think that's been the big thing is it will find that you forgot photos for a site or you forgot this on a site in before you leave the site drive three hours away and don't go back we can kind of catch a few of those things now going into it which is which is huge for us and huge as far as a QA QC standpoint so it's definitely helped progress and make things better and cleaner and just a better overall product for for everyone awesome great thank you Scott so I want to kind of shift gears here about a little bit and get more specific into some of the mapping advances so just want to hear from a couple of our organizations in terms of significant changes to your technology in respect to wetland science delineation is monitoring mitigation restoration etc so love to hear from from Daniel first from from misery everybody thank you for joining us today there's a lot to dive into here I'll try to just hit long on some of the high points I think that the biggest advance from from from where I'm sitting is this advent of web GIS and so most people are familiar with ESRI software through arcmap or maybe even arcmap pro that's actually can be visualized as one node in a vast ecosystem of connected maps apps and data which then support the company-wide workflow from field work into surveys and and beyond and it really adds a lot of improvements and efficiency games and supports collaboration another really big asset I think has been the living Atlas which is a Thorat ativ curated group of data from various sources that is made available to the people on the web GIS platform so as someone who has made many base maps throughout the day this this is such a resource to be able to not have to look back and find the most recent version of any given type of data it's all right there and easy to visualize example of this web GIS is how data that could be gone and gotten in the field can be synced to an organization's authoritative data and then made available to the rest of the company to use in whatever their particular workflows are and and shout out to eco bond all the hard work that they've done I think that it's a great example of integrating with ESRI platform now that they the data that can be gone in eco BOTS can be pushed into an organization's ArcGIS online and authoritative data so I think that that collaboration and this ecosystem of different maps and axes is from my perspective that the biggest advance great Thank You Daniel let's jump down to Jesse from upstream yeah thanks for having me so kind of the two main ways that upstream helps in this regard is synthesizing all available commercial and public domain satellite data and these satellites have been collecting information for the last several decades and so kind of the primary ways in which we're working with folks is one you know before you go to the field is how can you see the most recent image from your site and then understand you know how has that changed over the last couple of years so then monitor those ecosystems and the satellites are capturing just you know true color what you're used to seeing imagery but also a lot of information about vegetation and water patterns so we can automatically analyze what is the history of vegetation changes on this property and then if you did an intervention are you yielding the expected outcome to be able to monitor that a little bit more consistently prior to getting to the field so those are kind of the two main ways in which we're thinking about alleviating some of the challenges people are having when you can't actually get the field and being able to monitor remotely great Thank You Jesse well they want a little bit closer to the ground Daniel come in with that under Owens please sure and so in general I think some of the biggest changes with drones have happened in the last few years and they're going to accelerate from now on because I mean you think back to 2016 is when most people really started significant drone programs and then no you had large organizations with about a two-year tail on that so you got in the last two years people really starting to adopt drones and you know just from my personal experience when I started flying projects in 2016 I had a drone that was you know three feet wide and cost almost ten thousand dollars you put all this stuff together and you know that's not including the sensors and all that stuff and then you know it was a huge all-day event to go fly site and you know last week I flew five sites in one day and my drums a little bit bigger than my phone and so I think that's going to continue to change and another thing that I'm really excited about as far as innovation in the drone space is you know lidar sensors and a lot of people talk about that and you know I'm really excited that everybody's been mentioning workflow because nothing is more important than how stuff it's near workflow it doesn't work for you why are you doing it and so in you know it makes sense to think about these things ahead of time but you know you've got providers going with lidar sensors that are you know not two hundred thousand dollars but might be two thousand dollars giving you say a five centimeter speck instead of a three centimeter speck or you know something like that to where you can be in the field this is you know how I envisioned it fly your drone before you start process it while you're getting set up and maybe getting your flagging stuff ready getting your vest on starting out your day and after you've already started walking the site you're gonna come back and switch out your gear and you're gonna have a mobile lidar of your entire site in the middle of the first day I mean on a four week job or a four month job or for our job it's going to be cost-effective it's gonna save you time and it's gonna increase the deliverables and the quality of it and it's gonna charge a better price point if you're you know private provider if you're a public provider it's gonna get you data where you would never really get it before and I you know not only that with the mobile lidar but they're just regular RGB cameras I'm you haven't find wetland sites for a long time and if you continue that on a set pace and this is true of any industry you're going to extract things that you didn't know you could extract there's data there that you're not seeing or the way that it plays in to say your field points or maybe on your things that are but enough on your project and things like that you just never know what you're going to find I do a lot of environmental due diligence and you know you always want to see you know we can kind of tell where the stream you know you get the nwi you get the NHD put the drone imagery together it just works I mean use arcgis pro for that so thank you guys right but i'm really thankful for the drone space I think it's innovating I usually tell people that there's a significant industry change every six to eight months so you know don't anticipate what you're getting or what you're starting now is going to be the same thing you'll be doing two years from now you know if you're not changing everyday you're kind of going to get behind so that's really exciting for me keeps me busy I have pretty good job security there but anyway I really encourage everybody to use drones they're the best I get really excited about it so I'll try to limit my time but anyway there's a lot of innovation there and we can spend some more time on that great Thank You Daniel I'm we're gonna we're gonna meet northern Georgia sometime and have a dogfight with our with our drones I have insurance that's fine all right I don't so but mine's also an old-school tank it's gonna be like a World War 2 era version versus whatever you have I have to pull my my inspire out of the closet all right so I just want to kind of flip it back and you know you know Megan how do you think how do you think some of these advances in technology may impact the way we would conduct wetland science from like a data perspective and also from the modeling or planning perspective that's a very it's a deep question Jeremy I could take that in a lot of different directions I may have to just pick one so you mentioned modeling and data collection I guess where I'm most comfortable is of course mapping so are you asking me to tie in some of the technologies that have been mentioned to mapping and where we could take it in the future is that sufficient ok wonderful so I would say that we have already begun to do that and we've been doing it through time and you know I mentioned some of the ways you know we've been from analog to digital I mean that was a big jump we've been from aerial photographs to satellite images that was a big jump one thing that I didn't mentioned is the way that we distribute data so of course we used to send out hardcopy Maps people would send us and they wouldn't send us an email when they gosh they'd actually call us on the phone or they'd send us a letter and we'd send them a hardcopy new map but now of course we've got the the mapper and folks can see our data and use our data real time via our mapper we also have web services and we offer a function where folks can print PDF maps of our data and so it took us about 15 years between 1975 and 1990 for folks to print 1 million maps or for us to print 1 million maps and send them to our users but within the last four and a half years using the print function on our online mapper folks were able to print themselves 1 million maps so in less than a third of the time we were able to distribute the the same amount of information so we are definitely reaping the benefits of technical aaja chol advances at nwi one of the things that we are focusing in on now is how can we pull in better ancillary data so that we can not only map more efficiently so save costs but you can also produce higher quality data and so we've been we've been working on that and of course we've decided to pull own lidar light ARS huge so far we've been primarily using it as just kind of background imagery just as a plain dumb I'd like to use more topographic metrics I'd like to get more advanced in terms of the metrics that we use you know twis and whatever we can pull in I think that sometimes when you let the computer analyze the data it can come up with information that you can't necessarily see with your with your eyes and I think that's definitely true of lidar another way that we're looking to pull in advancements is that we still haven't completed mapping and Alaska and that's kind of our last frontier and it's really tough to map and Alaska I mean partly because we're just limited in the imagery that we can that's available to us I mean for many years we were limited to just spot imagery and it was just pulled in from all sorts of different dates and it was color balanced and in a weird way and it was just less than ideal on many levels and so what we've done now is we've worked with researchers from universe Marylyn to pull in a combination of sentinel or well actually to analyze sentinel data in part using the Landsat historic record partially through Google Earth engine to derive what we're calling some pixel water fraction which is not just binary information on inundated non indicated but percent of the pixel that's inundated and so you're able to resolve much smaller water features that way and we're using that as a really critical ancillary data that not only allows allows us to more accurately map wetlands but we're hoping that it will allow us to avoid fieldwork and minimize our helicopter and plane time because the helicopter and plane time is really expensive so by using the satellite imagery we could hopefully sustain accuracy and save costs great thank you I know I don't want to cut out field time but I'm gonna I'm gonna just change gears here a little bit because one of the questions that we've been getting from folks in the audience is around the accuracy of our ones and what types of real-time Corrections are available how accurate they are and so I wanted to give Adam an opportunity to speak to that from the consulting side yeah thanks thanks for having me Jeremy so in my experience it's it's pretty accurate I mean for for my field applications that I use on the consulting side I usually get that that sub meteor accuracy which which you know for that device is is pretty ideal especially for the price point you do I mean that's a that's a huge factor for the r-1 it comes at a really nice price point and it's it's super durable and and it's accurate for for you know the applications of delineation and that that sub meteor accuracy is is really fantastic and and certainly to I think that and this is probably something everyone is that there that there are limitations to - most of the GPS units we're going to use so multipath and canopy cover is certainly going to impact you know that accuracy and and how long we need to stay at a point but you know compared to open meadow areas so taking that into consideration and I think everyone who is used you know the the 7000 series for an X T or in X H is used to that but they but the r1 is is is does really perform well maybe some some low-hanging fruit here so to speak to keep in mind it it's super rugged and III think you can you can attest to that as well Jeremy I think you put it through his paces as well super rugged for me I can use the r1 on a full day without it being charged I mean that's a full charge and a full day on that the one thing I keep in mind and I think a lot of people were in this realm but but maybe just a little a little hint is when you're using your device you know as field scientists we're in the field so make sure that you bring a battery backup for your device that you're using because for me you know you're gonna run your r1 which is fantastic but when your smartphone or your tablet goes down you know midway through so a lot of times I bring a charged battery backup that I can use in the field you know just stuff like that the other thing too is how you protect your smartphone or your tablet in the field you know whether that be a protective case waterproof like that so you know stuff like that it kind of it seems trivial to just on a low-level basis but really that's something that really comes into play cuz we're running a lot of different apps not just collector on our smartphones or tablets a lot of us are using a lot of different apps at the same time so really be cognizant of your device that's actually collecting the data it's gonna it's gonna drain your battery pretty quick so but overall it's you know pretty pretty accurate piece of equipment that's that's really fantastic so great Thank You Adam and I know it's 1:30 now so if anybody needs to cut off we are recording this we're gonna take about five or six more just to kind of round off our conversation I know battery wise for myself using the r1 in the field if I'm working hours like I've worked with some of you who are on this collar on this panel out in the field if we're working twelve or fourteen hours in the field we'd definitely need that booster charger I'm not working the union hours here so so what I wanted to do is now switch and go over to the the hardware provider side and Darrin have you come in in respect to the r1 as well well thanks I think Adam covered a lot of the good information there it's good to see that you're achieving for the most part the accuracy that you that you require yeah Adam brought up a really good point GPS and GNSS technology we're still receiving very weak radio signals from 11,000 plus miles in space and you do have to be aware the r1 is a nice you know nearly a playing card packed sized GNSS receiver and is tempting to throw it in a backpack the top pouch on your backpack or you know throw it in a shirt pocket or a vest pocket but the best practice would be to make sure that it does have an unobstructed view of the sky so that you do get the accuracies that you're expecting in the field a lot of times people connect to a real-time source and there's a couple of ones there's a free one in the u.s. called Waze that I'm probably most people are aware of Trimble also has a real-time satellite delivered correction system it does require a subscription but it allows your r1 to get down to about the 30 centimeter to one foot or or one foot accuracies I'm not sure what is needed in this industry but it sounds like submeters quite practical for most users and I know we're running short on time but I think Jeremy we've we have plans to do another one of these where we can deep dive into more GNSS technology so I'm looking forward to that awesome thank you Karen certainly appreciate you joining us here so when I pivot a little bit and about you know the use of say arcmap versus arc pro versus using the open source type data and so I wanted to see if either Todd or Scott I we didn't actually get to check in on this do either of you have experience using the art part GIS online or are you guys using arcmap what maybe both you guys could take yourselves off and just chime in a little bit there well this is Todd yeah we're basically using the arcmap in the office at this point we as we he's actually offered some online courses on our pro right now and so we've got some of our staff taking those looking at transitioning to that been really impressed with the projects the the products so far but we use arcmap for everything maybe something most people don't use it for is we actually use it for wetland mitigation design we're making full engineering plans using arc which is can be somewhat of a challenge but it's what we what we're we're good at what we're used to and we're not using CAD for that we're drawing full that full engineering set plans in the arc platform so I have not used the the open source software at all yeah I know some people are using like QGIS to and have had some pretty good success with that what are you guys using Scott we're actually transitioning more away from arcmap we still do both we do a lot of arcmap for our day to day just because it's a quick clean map system that we can get what we like using our pro for is that we can edit things live and that's been very helpful we can also move large datasets quicker it doesn't bog down the computers as much we have a lot of guys that remote into a computer and pull things that way instead of having to bring everything down and save it to a local source they can kind of do it live and that's really helped us like I said you know you go from one site to the next and you can pull things down quicker and check things and it's really sped a support a bit so we're fully starting to transition into that since we use our Jes online a lot and things like that seems to work really well for us all right great thanks Scott well you know Daniel one of the things that I hear come Daniel Marton one of the things I hear come come up in conversations a lot I even see some of the questions coming in on my chat session down below as you know just in respect to you know like you know efficiency of the different tools that are available but also cost like why would someone choose to use software as a service versus you know using you know an off-the-shelf software you're on you there you know there we go yeah that's a that's a great question [Music] so I think that the best of that I could that I could say from personal experiences that I have found the price points have lowered significantly over the last five or ten years while the functionality has increased but ultimately it comes down to a case-by-case decision that needs to be made looking at it hello holistically to see if the efficiency gains of software such as like ESRI software is actually going to offset that price and I think that oftentimes the decision you know that the answer might be yes but I would advocate everyone to do the analysis yourself and look at that great Thank You Daniel and Jesse I know you guys are offering software as a service as well and to some extent so how would you how did you handle question like that in terms of looking at whether you know it's off-the-shelf software or if it's you know something that is more of a service based yeah great question I would echo a lot of what Daniel has said similar is thinking about what are the specific workflows that you're looking to automate and so what we try to do from the upstream perspective is what are similar workflows across a lot of different organizations so we can build a uniform process that many people can can utilize and then if there's specific customization and let's try to answer questions that a lot of other people are also asking so it doesn't have to be a one-off really specific really expensive cost yeah I think that's the short answer great thank you and so I just want to switch back over to like more from the consulting side and see you know Adam from you know your perspective you know when you're looking at things as an educator and thinking about people getting out in the field more and how they're mapping and projecting things you know where do you see some of the differences in terms of you know off-the-shelf software versus software as a service for me I think that as I wouldn't mean I certainly have experience when it comes to the GIS platforms that I use online but certainly the support has always been you know a functionality for for me that I use I don't have years and years and years of experience when it comes to to GIS but but certainly from from a support standpoint you know something when you you you always have that as you know you can reach out to to folks through ESRI if there's a question that comes up so it certainly helps from from that end and I certainly use that often they have a quite a wide array of free webinars and and tutorials that have really helped me to be honest with you and it's it's really been from practical into just from from a standpoint of using that r18 you know they work hand in hand so and that's another reason why I like that are one in combination with arc on line as soon as you're in the field you submit your data if you're working online and it's it's simultaneous to to ARCA online so it's it's really unique and and and certainly from an efficiency standpoint is what we've been talking about here really really hits and checks a lot of a lot of boxes for for me and and in my company and and too from an education standpoint so great thank you so just when I kind of cause there and you know we've kind of maxed our time here so one one last question I want to just dive into here with a couple folks you know it's just you know right now with Kevin 19 a lot of people are concerned about their jobs if we're creating tools that are creating better efficiency in our workflow you know there are some people that have some curtain CERN's with that and so one of the questions is you know in respect to you this particular field requires a lot of experience it requires a fair amount training and you know if you're not a taxonomist to be a really deep in on the soil side you gotta bring one strong suite of tools to the table is there you know it's you know one of the questions that I hear come up sometimes in these conversations and it's popped up in a few of the chat bubbles here is you know will tack replace scientists and so you know first I want to I'd love to hear from Todd from a person from the perspective of an educator and a consultant as also as a as a professor in a university yeah it's an interesting question I I don't think we're there yet I think that we need people with expertise we need botanist in ecologists and other natural resource professionals really for the power of human observation I think we are currently better than than tech at observing the landscape making decisions based on what we're seeing does the tech get there I think we're are ways off I think the positive that is behind the tech is scientists and so maybe the jobs are shifted some I'm a field ecologist so I feel pretty strongly that we need people out in the field I know a lot of the GIS guys think that they can do a lot maybe more than they and I think they should from the office but I think we still and always will need people in the field making personal observations they even to help feed that tech great Thank You Todd well and Scott love to hear from you from the consulting side yeah I mean I just reflect on what Todd said you know mostly behind all things I mean I mean just look at yourself Jeremy scientists are building these things to help us and that's and that's great and these are great tools to use but professional judgment goes into a lot of what we do wetland delineation is not --is-- a black and white thing and you need to be able to go out there see what something looks like in the spring see what something looks like three weeks later four weeks later I mean many of times I've gone to sites just to see progression and that's just something that I don't think can be automated and automation is nothing new I mean it's been trying to take jobs for years but there's nothing that to trial and error I mean we're creating these datasets for a long time than when you do research it's not just yeah I went out there for this month and I looked at this it's I went out every month for the last five years to build this huge data set to use it for everybody and that's how we're building like the nwi stuff this is how we build based building on foundations of everything that we're using so you still need professional judgment you still need skilled people and you need to be able to train your skilled people also to be able to use these new technologies great thanks Scott and Kim you want to chime in yeah I just wanted to give a real quick a specific example from the Water Management District we were going to do some use some satellite imagery to do some vegetation mapping and it was kind of our little test into getting the AI all figured out and we set up training data and it was theirs so a couple individuals that these are this is an area I've been working in the wetlands for 30 years so I kind of know him really well and we were specifically wanting to map cattail and so the folks that were really good at with the ArcGIS and env software and things like that and another person with using statistics said okay well let's get these points down and figure them all out and see what it does and I took a look at it as you know someone who knows the ground and said oh yeah it's getting these parts wrong and so we usually actually had to use me as a really integral part and you know substitute me for any one of you that has experience on the ground with the resource that you're working in to say okay this is what this is this was an I trained the AI so it could train itself so I think you really cannot take us out of it and different and it's also different in different scales you know if you're doing something like drone work you still have to have the person that's familiar with with the area so I think it's no way it's ever going to replace us but it's going to make us do our job a lot faster and we can do a lot more work great Thank You Kim and I want to get them back and kind of end cap with with amber because I know being down in the Gulf you know there's a lot of people that have lost jobs in the oil and gas industry there and you and I have been talking about that a lot over the last couple years but just kind of cap off you know where where do you sit when you're watching this whole thing from the perspective of is tech gonna replace scientists you're on mute yeah a hundred percent agree with what everyone said there's no way that it could replace the professional judgment that we all have gained over the decades you know that we've been working in this field and I I guess I mean it really ultimately is you know reducing human error so you know of course we're human humans err so I think to round it off yeah I think technology is amazing and it's helpful there's no way it could could replace us at least not anytime soon and probably I hope not within my lifetime right are yours job stability and louisiana's necessary right now so so yeah I think you know it's simply reducing human error making us work more safely and more efficiently and so that's that's my thoughts I guess about 15 minutes really appreciate that I mean this is we could probably continue this conversation which is why we're going to roll into some additional webinars that hyper specifically focus in on some of these tech areas we had 200 people register for this for this event today and I think we had about 160 plus people that actually showed up I didn't see the metric because I was giving the presentation at the time but when I when I came back I would saw that there are still 146 people at that time so thank you all for taking some time out of your days I think this is a great utilization and way for our community to gather together and to share information and excited about what's coming next - I'm gonna go ahead and mute myself and turn it over to Mike to endcap us and thank you all again panelists you are all awesome I'm sure everybody on the audience is giving you a warm round of applause right now and yeah you are great look forward to actually physically seeing you at some point in your future all right thank you thank you great job everyone this was really interesting I can see a lot of conversations it's kind of just starting to bubble up as we were close to running at a time so it's really encouraging to see you know such a lively conversation we really look forward to doing more of these webinars and we're very very interested in your feedback so please feel free to reach out to Jeremy or myself directly let us know what you thought let us know what you want to talk more about look out for a survey coming from me that will just kind of encapsulate that question and let us collect what everybody's really thinking about that as well as I'll be sending out a link to the recording in case anyone had to jump in late or wants to see something again so again thank you so much to our panelists for spending the time today and for everyone who is able to join us we really appreciate it everybody thanks again and take care stay safe everyone see you soon
