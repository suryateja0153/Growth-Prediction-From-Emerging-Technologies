 this is part of 01 of industrialization on gilded age so we are starting with letter C capitalization and invention this one of the things that's going to be an economy get better and bigger register so unless you're going to see new bubble that Gilded Age number one civil war helps long in a speech at a time samuel clement we had talked about the end of our last unit is one of the things that the Unites American the last have this revolution large industrial the Gilded Age goes from ways we're going to see i have several factor they all come together and when he was done with my back i said to me realize was much greater today before the summer firstly he has it handle just we're kind of creating this if you learn horrible analogy kind of visualization America right I'm on this is your first ingredient is capital we're gonna have to lose money railroad businesses are going to get a larger judgment of the money be second revolution the United States kaisers person is borrowing a painting they're great and be happy this dust really power for all the world girls and so I think more a really good for our guns artillery you ever associate nitrogen on the pumping off a layer of money into the economy shipping businesses are so they can wait and see so this is you're gonna have a lot of money the government is giving him lots and immigrants would ever be living in that poverty um see the farmers um is we're seeing raw material ruption this is we said in CA Jews raw materials are gonna be proportional you know they stayed the shiny shiny and bright they have access to a new crew saying a real right so the railroads are gonna loud get bigger than bigger can be summation a little fish died today Wow certainly entitled grow market amazing here we see railroad together roads are going to allow a lot of people not just a lower people in the immediate area but they all reckon cell so now the pretty sure that we see all those times patients mostly co railroads in the Rocky Mountains and that's what you like Chinese as you submit for the monomer she played all the biggest expense on this and so they made sheathing laborious like you helped your one is the Negro rightly awful pun intended of course inside that charlie is railroads railroad van winkle South the United States ah materials at Westall by Republic back three or mark they're gonna pass a hold on Silas latian so it's gonna help tie the econo marry the business it is a moral tariff abatement make a railroad forcing America seal to buy our northern goods an issue that other I'm because the stuff is about the nor all of these things like the railroads point is Magnus is we're going to be building which allows us to go get those Frank Erica motives we're going to need to have all of those injuries develop especially steel and so we're going to see America its economy is going to be boosted because we see number 23 economic growth um we're gonna tarick all these large mentions just some of them just to give you some examples as well as aren't there we're gonna a tying the naturalization together spread so as I so the first thing a cash register we're gonna see our guest for this judge is what you do before we have cabbage wars we do go to a store they do this a finish the door factory and somebody would have to between by this yes I write down all the items that you were buying and a minute more races down and there's a calculated up by serial those kind as you can tell this we're so we see number one on the top sport which limited the amount of goodness in the United States market since I've and so I don't see somebody invent the cash register which which he made the one of the cushion countries and no birth is the amount but then give you this big long to near the end of the time president of this impact is a great extent I calendars women anyone this as well nology mixer America endorse any sound for these forests which means they give you a building or uneven business completely rapid rate Max's pictionary CT is just the road again before this time everything 18 japan trip first you out and that was hard for businesses small amount of rides and then I you see being someplace and writing more than maybe miscommunications also we see businesses I'm not a better so we get we on vacation or so these high brokers where I start to taste allows you to type really quickly you can read what the person L these were really expensive takes because I'm looking road that we're gonna function solely see this on terrorism and the Ferguson's continental were always imagined there's several be very more but first one is gonna go find a huge specific in the central Pacific's we see something called in stock doing through southern while the stock ticker and the way answer lies this railroad 20 telegraph hustler and so let me say der you're in denver colorado yes and you want to invest in the stock material it is really hard workers you don't know whether the mice to discuss spirit is in the very cause it a low price too high of a reason itself or whatever you have a minute I think they're gonna happen show you good morning to style purchases because they haven't yet solution which is not a good way to compete I don't know you're exactly and so the stock ticker they send in automation sis Cal the telegraph wire three wherever you are and then just checked over two days to hear Wayne a kickable bed so you like to roll around around all the railroad to the mounting price of snow fort um my mother saw so I'm so worn I just taken it when I say today when his warning messages you ever so companies can get richer because they have four more people building stones in America especially transcript of course we get either way super bowl with the government totally change um in 1876 Alexander Corvinus away if this is my voice got more this time I would hesitate now or that you had to have somebody way understand there's still no nor do the dice for shoes and that would take time to dress transcribe government aside somebody cutters down bookends bow is time and so now I could just pick up our own in Denver Colorado when I takes like they serve for you for such and such amount of goods I sound like we're gonna see Roxy the point pi bond that American businesses even in a connection a railroad company messengers needs to be back up to businesses I'm it's not so we see closes a cool and great remedy our unity government under Africa my said the businesses get bigger or some of the real company this is a whole bunch of man we're talking millions of acres we're gonna give to you next your inventions continues here we want a railroad track this is certainly going to help us quickly food one so the federal government is glomped if you broke error huge land give away food like tomatoes that are gonna sell the next thing we're here is a sort of like really Louise slaughter in 10,000 instruction kind of passed and so now the business can be so big those brows they let me pay you back but now the integrated cars everybody can have huge meat packing is always see too much those 10,000 pounds put him on ice they'll stay cold on a local level and then we're gonna sloot the railroad entire United States relevant elite package me to get a rarity co- we leave denver on the map advanced mini figure it would be connected to the transcon railroads we see Mero design create this an additional right but if the gate guard did learn art we were depressed until about nineteen sixty and tendrils are the railroad companies they all have a different gauges so if you wanted to drop or so sounds from one part of the Canadian without their roast thought you had them off the road those locations as we reach our company with all the breaks gauges it sounds great i'm home and i'm not going another world is syre i am which would rewrite the railroad company so we start our serum and so um government bottom especially their monopoly they all have asked and you ever get a chance now railroad trunk is easy a state of Iowa refrigerator carpool go crazy about building oh you know going from one river but this is another move the car around you unload and load every time you change all you have to do it's a way to get bribes and then the real thing even see you this is a workman rose-tinted this day we'll all get rates faster which means instead of in the past when a railroad and it sells north and so the metal on metals and you would put a metal pass fiction cover-up going at this time to out of the North a who we're gonna for working well that would proclaim the spark and gyres as room from whence top and tight as you try make sure um right officials but shall we have these hairbrained row becomes much for giving our label interest less fires I mean so true lasting on the same I'd if we look at the bottom where 10 and more can be we see now the railroads buddies actually don't pull anything for Dom so if you look at the bottom right hand corner you see this kind of yellowish with the road let's talk about a specific across it you could put and so that landlord gets eye from Thomas show but both sides homage medicine and the main thing where's I wanted to see here wheeler spike mom are going to show how do you tell any lie to see the government to the world or the electric light obviously this is sylvester ii supporters today open road they had anywhere will then be mom is so valley the ocean to make a name would kill away so not a new bill or they would go now chooses what was Leyland cheap loans trulia there also will really sell their ex like that into something to farm heresy and to make a bucket of oil and really explosives anybody knock them over they will smash you start the fire on fire in my this latest game is so and so Thomas medicine rates so just by having like we're out there that I Orlando soundless Queens the real Iron Charlie's run Sheila only lasts um it's gonna make it a bit of money her these pay for Wayne diverting the squares the alternating squares that are not pink that they're blue Thomas Edison also those are going to be with ran States government is recording of it to get out it or this time if you wanted to listen to so what we notice here was part of the ocean uh concert hall where somebody when it does we sort out the good thing for far more there boys awesome and the really good land photographs or ran over players it's already gonna be in different way to the room music in so the home center so does how far is guilty more ways for people to be because a lot of good layout already know street people can make these phonograph either to build a fact on more fun to have people who produced records itself I we do see some one of the weapons industry and so I city not just because I think it's also the Overman workshop menorca and local governments get involved homicide medicine also had another invention and is called let's talk about the most important one Edison's talking about a bunch of environment gather with a civil very worried the funny part of the Candy's gonna sit down say okay for the process of diversity wanna bacteria northern route um and so we're gonna see this is gonna create you know hundreds to the revered was put on the labor to North and South especially still the streets and create even out of cancer aspects start the railroad and a prominent bike during the Civil War emotion to takes you right the Republican it from college this is my demica we just had a photograph and of course he has the idea of putting ave going paragraphs and without walks out as you should films Republican in Turin just like a flip over they come around Asia so to that's what we have said all the government is going to go straight home in a row well present company our governments under give them play a normal interest not just a factories and so we see the 30 and all-star wheels solution airy and the motion is good i also haha Santa Mexico is across Greater lanes each all over the rocky mountains across the aging you torch over the Sierra Nevadas so that's a lot more people come to America to find a job so again i'm in eighteen sixty nine um we see this railroad completed it extra section seated captain we have a two railroad so just like a problem and the Union as yours where completion and all of them so much we're gonna see let me see this edge there's gonna be done for me a chromatic up so soft and the two railroad dominate on their particular if they read together in create just north of salt and so if it's positive you have to read about their toast super hero sure these are highly now a final American in Cairo dust feel great they're going to make America industry strong they're gonna provide our continued to so they are now that the United States government in a park there is another way of recapping sorry okay but who actually got real good I mean this is awry merrily if we're gonna tell Papa see figure the railroads that is starting in second amend or so people salmon are primarily can easily buy a new case we have group that is to create well for some air Chinese mi casa q the shyness we got to swim into own 60s and 70s trees eighty something as our Chinese fertilize their poor with them is bad for me people robber barons who knees press the words are there is going R to the skill today's this time for speed or exertion this is going to be attracted well that is choosing of the infusion rich people and we chose not use my knees old filling or going work rebels in santa presents the contractual workers now and they're gonna have to do so before we simply well the richness Chinese are back tomorrow burn a are helping you and also the bottom I you see or know the specs Henry dangerous a pickaxe and the sledging the rogue studies beginning so Eliza fatalities of the Rosalie they weren't those concerns if they lost railroad workers because of immigrants and we can pay that price so here's one of our Rocca calculate industry so this series picture on the right shows you looking on the repository Carnegie Union Pacific is gonna make real from do harm and while we see that here primarily we learn also or another group especially opportunities for Irish were still decent continually to come into a mirror are these super hung in robert has one of the top ramen but also the car are they capital industry good are they helping jobs could become so we're see Irishman most of them settle in the Northeast but some of them do come out west to work on the railroads also they're creating it works very dangerous if you want on it as a positive native all very moving veins but it is certainly nice is better jobs is helping America have more money and so again we get the rpd and so next we have this concept of healthy so let's talk these relics home sighs what they would be able to sit down where's if industry and they would have induced rum to make their money how they make money they want of the train what they were better today laying another mile or two of track so we're gonna start out with john deere on our own how do you run without full boil a stratum and then the workers were coming state dormitory and so what we see again and so every time we use to light our homes not only will there be a dormitory kerosene lamps there are also do some blooms and brothels and care so we see this is coil are you doing out of the grass totally see these china and seller does not living as Melanie know where we in for the rural committee and almost for free oil because it is very lonely I'm terrified and then the railroad company would run on embarrassed cuz for the workers with Solomon area past so I'm looking for oil because it's a hit or miss home and so does not tear out and most drills is in with a what ha does do we'll see start so we see these kind of vital email turn that oil into care is no companies you only like Medicare where we see Raun and so she says look this is a much better industry to dominate because I don't have to find I don't have to have limbs height of the road I don't need to go dig feel this is a point I made earlier because what we're going to see is that the railroads represented here I'm gonna do is I'm saying they're gonna come in America all refined all of the resources so and see whether to buy oil or Rancher subjects and sarah c mon 500 i have in life because we're going to be reeling railroads of course your mind so during my Johnny run their own sense of completion Rockefeller sounds incredible accomplish goals in Central West like the P wheat and corn integrate all of those raw materials are gonna be says this is wrong because if I have to happen one with so now our fact by some additional resources and that's integrity superocean fairly we're going this also because be able to sell my products i finished it would be much better if major in bio refineries like our to a bigger markets so here's our faculties or south for the cities rise dry so the US had everything is business and of course you tying together in our south east west because how do you rid of this competition so we've are dissolved with that big trend we need to show tension cutting prices section or bates pool is that certainly as businesses are going to guinea pig earlier big E's gonna have been some other in part because they have more resources than so progress in the can be somebody's on the road industry it's not going to continue poised to but now your hand have Rodney Rockefeller and remember the priests are going to see um has his refinery businesses getting so because they get to be boiled front of insulin from the end of a surreal it's a history minor early room time to indicate one or then he has to send the kerosene games assume early so he was to crash on railroads on both sides of his business bringing the oil who's our workers factories who and so a big part of so we toss about the JCC I remember a couple of emigration from separately cuz he goes to grow companies it well because what my goals are several companies do Billy says you need to leave me a secret rebate so if remedy is your cracked immigrant so you're gonna pay me we have to choose your rights coming rent stuff so this is a limitation other countries another way funny or the Chinese senators also there were going to happen within them is competing against as they don't know because it's far too technology so they don't understand why Rockie don't as many feel richer and richer richer and so we're gonna see they're not we can he has access children forest and resiliency and why isn't jumping Samaras or that they're having you know to pay the road companies little with all these people using the fairies want a job you see their horse leads to organization these can get the railroad impatient give him amazing editor's he factories to railways and surround the Thunder Allah says Laura groups if you want lemon in the factory space I want you to tell me about other console's cities went to the origin for this actually Chicago where they get into a royal brundtland I mean daddy and I we see their size I'm just cuz their price here's a picture of your star the end is so he actually using the massive article tactics immigrants come all these world IC is equal pat dailey up to balaam brightly lower Lisa I'm also lots of Jewish the final thing well the next thing that he does so you see this thing called for the cities are gonna be really not just happen so what we see on this older people can see the production process so we see oil taken out of the brown part of the season putting on trains able to control ian says to his refinery fewer than once it's harder to care of these people but are not join a bigger just because the production process food and so Rockefeller has again he doesn't want to go and drill for oil so he doesn't go out love da same rail road narrows oil will stream try to go so a barren and he's wearing your i reran is a learning couple deals today I could do so his glow is so we see this country's America is getting an F you cannot put all his competitor los nobles who has all the refineries like that powers no sweeter production company it's called horizontal decide to go into one so few businesses because in America if you wanna buy kerosene railroads since you told me Henry you only one person you fell from a funerary as a man who rises after day but we all the rosy make it makes him let me give you two examples one is William eight and we're going to call this when we controls collar or different comedy is gonna enjoy your over industry coast we call that a nun west coast we're gonna and it's just a way of organizing the railroad first whereas another relay that burgeoning tools organize all the roads on the west you folks have a lot of them his name is Lena basically what happens is less pretentious one of those fineries later on me give a few a helmet and see University and Rockefeller what he does it mean goes to those little oil costs because it says if so I received from this railroad man unless you want my car they control and so streets one of the two rupees we're romarin three give old Rockefeller control of their purview of the reminder controls Crossing Harris to run a drum with some time so even a road and only all of these are barely as you can all get your control out of easy man because Melrose they know that if they don't have monopoly in their area otherwise called it trusted gets travel on the river and every measurement Stanford now he's gonna make money to the road makes less money but they still won't be if you are a farm so poor as he actually when it gives your crops where your goods to market another thing women because we seen this week's commercial cleaning it's a week enjoy service members try sensitive he can the government is going to say okay people had to give us to Morrison so here we see you later picture the robber baron trust on the rare the gun and there's can't do this is able to the Rockefellers are farmers you can think of some way of creating this small business you're locking Catherine's um minor progress one secondly she's another small business mother right he's saying stickam accompany you AT&T represented by demand if you want to get your crop it so we cannot get your how to trust anymore it's only see if you're evil Rockefeller somebody's really well to where we have to do now is marble Eric with sunlight but we're gonna lock the fellow prisoner embarrass or raw bar for Danny rush so much power that run our company so so now didn't try to learn gain in power how are they both r I open headers has his own men tablish mojada board of directors of all of his competitors and socially one fools of all they do this is a little walking so the power is the same these guys raiding a monopoly are these robber barons and we started business issues today that's a way again whiteford again on petition of employment goal of and so Rockefeller has to ride is not a business created so I'm Joel having an option but how can the game Monopoly cyclists drive every Christmas any cold on the board company so they saw a lot of capitalism there is to be Lee companies these years by and I'm not talk and what we do that is tenders this is that you so we live in the shorts on let's say create it's on the level here with my pricing on the lamprey it's a Rockefeller wants vehicle driver competitive is 0 because you made I just as much as you he can shave a drawer of that stocks and and advanced Lee as the other predators go out of bed and so he owns a company can even if it's you just make one more and more of the market nobody else and you will eventually or the be the only businesses down and then if you want to and so it's like an indicator will raise prices to whatever you want so we have four circles muscle campany because they we see this anywhere the same company ozone yes it's a modern-day example if we could Disney they're also market is we're going to enjoy name because they use this practice bail pricey that's very hard target right to work hold on a mom-and-pop so bottom line is the computer getting bigger I said stronger and more to our results and we're especially people drinking more veggies nicely Buffalo don't have all the market it's the only place you can go for clothes or tires or whatever he gets so big crisis hit by 1900 john d rockefeller stags way too many tries a tradition dies mr. said it does tie the oil this thing called seamer which means he is shot reinforcing done in time really whisk you know about it and so we so what happens is it doesn't really don't but think that Rockefeller I one strum a chili's for negative terms of Barbara bear to use my mic money that they start so I brought memories I say well I just come early as long as my thousand dollars Romero and so we see that ship is holding the capital um and so someone only my competitors wants to buy us all devices you can someone caller says I will generation eight dollars if you pass this piece of legislation so steep editors you she don't know right dollars even reaching for the white guys a priority because these dildos in my company sees all these companies and my competitor chance to you right now and of the guy is jose rizal can use a most common enemy and not his company did hundred dollars will structure and this certainly is making a reason mirror this is very neat urban base i think i'm always get chose by this time i am posting the price of a thousand dollars our next Captain division is going to Joe and I say look I told you before AT&T he has his industry the Hillary steal that you can put in your pocket our nikki is Jenny misread don't tell anybody I'm doing this because I don't want my arm pitch to figure how I only broke kid and so I see families he's gone debate over three hundred dollars and he gets it all the railroad century and he peeled he is usually like those others retro rich man is out of business the company but when Saudis until that's a sorry word right your people and the truth how am i standing back rise a little bit running under the team make some money oohs and then you decide to the light so they choose yield in this job and you started under stop buying our steel plants um how next use for calls where they turn upon a bunch of businesses come together see here I other industry let's go back to our example of Joe Spurgin last place by Wallace listings that he there are still three railroads later near the house closed his we have lots of immigrant of its my railroad it's in the center in the Northeast one company so we have company railroads and we had somebody whole deposit overall I already circuits near iron order for Joss so fish makes an isthmus watching the children is fish on a railroad I make steel so 5ml be seen in under my main competitor and so I know it out wouldn't be I say hey look review and your company's me and me and he is a firm believer in order together let's pour more R&D well why you're sort of spends a lot of our most allows our railroads our money our capital he try and me would be a movement since we have more money together you'll get more customers he figure if he can really be a believer guitar prices toggle way to sharing drive hospital companies and you see so we can drive and hit some of Hannah's associates they go that Europe ins and they 9 about a in any local baci competitors the best of my pointy on out every 13 of the arcust issues and so she still make the success 30 in Europe these Hebrew over to united states on the picture to show you the guy in charge of an heir to pay for to understand the process and it allows him all the warnings of por si elite attributed rights of course is his header once you control so he slowly purchase what I want this there is nobody else the jurisdictional has because he stays in good time she didn't moving out and Mimi's when there are business mcallister and more interaction pricing god you guys do those things that matter not as much as a competitor shows if he saves money fish market makes money to get there then neocons owns I cannot cartel like I'm perhaps I say look like what to say these creatures you have during these bad time to support all right steel they can't make any money hence way since token of my sacrifice Elton a price I may have contested facing bankruptcy and so this is advised to how ill direction win over me rebounds down his couple is prices vary and then another panic hits he goes up and buys an aesthetic reception when the economy anytime we see large businesses that making it so slowly but surely it's just human nature we're going to see corrosion in businesses and in the government so let's talk so let's talk about watering up which is different so let me lose another animal or an example let's look at let's say that I am vertical integration as you control a cowboy it's not then when writing rely Longhorns have heard one equation which so I raised these he is gonna go out on driving him to market ourselves and write the Guerrera market the RT has is I miles I need a pillar at my channel and so he paused they waive my cows and love that I can tell me fella Rockefeller did ten cents a stone to pay real monkeys county Kenny Bates because when they leave them money out of cards unless and so here's what I have to be so what I do is an old cowboy companies right so he was a kid by customer melrose whole bunch of Saudi breezy or anything they look that's less and looking at salt as an they're really funny are so fighters are like I'm streaming in drink so he's mine make income that's their third and you can buy this cold water and lock now my cows are low to the water so much meat but you are still they get on the scale this is a little my cattle way more and so why maybe they get our night so as prices yet his my paper than everybody else they don't wake us what the skills so as time goes on well thats awesome i sustain for your shoes for the railroad companies are so starts out with vertices the vehicle are gonna water pistols as you can and so what they do shall we see him is both vertical these railroad companies right they sell stock to raise every party so if I'm if I'm so called a again he and I want to fill out new railroad or I wanna you know he can I have a something politician or whatever I need money he said Mike was good read espera make money is good because beach jobs my company is doing I'm a Senate of live on my company run by the cheap studio with 15 part of my gradually arises they don't buy some sky rises I better be give us money let's say getting good shoes or in this case as you can see on the options so this is moses good on and so they would feed also their party says the man who dies leaving behind him millions of available wealth which was his administrators and so they all part of my body but I now I don't any more dollars so i can use matter what you love myself build what a little pieces he leaves the tottering stomper week than what i do is i lie to my of such as the point beautiful item anodized mike rigney is doing amazing business so once he finally makes his million civilians so I just eat then it goes on them so they think Mike's getting rid of his were all fifteen dollars right here in the head of to society believes that America so in it in the pot anyway so I'm able to and so now my investors the fam a going and helping other people be so that's gross watering started Aug help make a regulated us on they say anything well that should spend it back they were cyclic Ellard age is that the government we have enough mobility to give back I'll isness grow it's become wealthy but otherwise I'm gonna take a hands on a special kind of say we're not gonna force you to do a party wanna do he that's close awesome nope i do it means and frankly and talking millions realistic oh this certainly is a salon safe a million when the sky program diversities to whatever they want to merge the calls go to we're not highly prairies those are all places where people although people the thing that we are canary was we serve so hard to help they still get an education but we're gonna give go and learn source appreciate oh you see knowledge musicus and so in that weird relationship do but he would walk upright on his way to grow millions at the library to walk right by somebody told regularly their bad busy he didn't believe in getting handouts he would get all sales and you still like anyone really university or thumbing make some dry clothes raise money to those help yourself and you just can't get another compound fizzles I'm gonna give University so once and you say you'll see them if I were so you develop this is probably they did some so it's legal and when I'm a fish thing if you say you're sooo them eat and so what you do is the manager that you can run and drive your competitor sure if I just give my money for a sandwich have your tea hey subscribe versus down I can I Drive through education $10,000 yourself rule for lifetime that's Andrew never happened or are you brought a politician we see it's a one who had another bowl company a most musically he's donate money for you of course you can drive all the politicians in Tulane University do your reading any and this would be the person giving the actus and so you get the business they do what you own people and so we see certainly this is a ton JPMorgan another captain of industry he doesn't do steal he doesn't do oil so that will be our first bubs gilded a trusted we have them all and so does JP Morgan is an investment banker in other words he is the person you go to if you have money and you want to invest in the stock market he's going to be the one that will invest it for you he knows the stock market in and out he knows how companies are doing he can tell you which that what companies to buy what companies to sell and when and so he's going to be a trusted advisor and so the richest people in America the banks of america they give they let JP may pay JP Morgan on to help manage their money that's what investment banker does so that's why it's the money trust now why does JP Morgan know about all of these companies because he as part of his fee he would say look I'll invest your money for you and I won't even charge you that much for tell you what to invest in but you have to let one of my guys from my investment-banking company is called the house of Morgan you have to put one of my guys on your board of directors and so JP Morgan knew what every company was doing if they were really doing well or not if they're about to merge if they're about to open up a new factory if a factory is struggling to survive he knows the ins and outs of these companies what goes on behind closed doors because he hasn't been on their board of directors and so he has inside information about how to invest now today you can't do this is called insider trading but once again and the United States government is not going to tell businesses what they can and can't do this is a time of celebrating business being in bed with business right so in 1901 JPMorgan creates the first billion-dollar corporation in America JPMorgan he convinces Andrew Carnegie to sell all of his steel mills and he joins it with other steel companies and they join together and create us steel which is the first billion-dollar corporation in America of course JP Morgan is getting at a hefty fee for organizing this merger but we see that this is the kind of money we're talking about as time goes on in the Gilded Age businesses are getting bigger and bigger and bigger through mergers or competition and it's because of the efforts of guys like JP Morgan so this leads to a new class in America it's called the nouveau riche which in French means the new rich we're talking about Carnegie rockefeller Morgan these are the guys that are now in control of America not only they do they have so much power that they can control Congress as you see in the left hand side picture but they also have so much money that they control the Senate and the presidency so we see mockingly this picture of Rockefeller he has so much money he's so powerful that he can he can take over Congress we've turning Congress into a refinery he can tell the president what to do because the president probably got elected with Rockefellers money on the right-hand side we see the Senate and then we see all of these big huge captains of industry and it says trust on their stomachs because these are all you know the copper trust or the beef trust or the coal trust their the companies that have so much money they can get politicians elected or they can buy politicians so we see this super powerful new aristocracy develop in America the nouveau riche now of course there is the old money in America sometimes called blue blood these are guys like the Adams is the Lee's the Roosevelts there are people that have been political leaders in America for a long time and they are losing their status to these new new-money the new rich they look down on them because the old wench went to Harvard or or or Yale and these new rich people probably didn't even go to college at all like like Carnegie and so we see that there's this kind of social disdain between the old rich and the new rich um it gets so dramatic that by the end of this time period the top 10% of America on almost all of America's wealth ninety percent what's more astounding is when you flip that which means ninety percent of America is fighting and scrabbling over just ten percent of the wealth and so we certainly have the gilded ages of time of these powerful rich men controlling America and its money and so in the top left ten side of the picture you see the old nobility and the peasants giving them giving them everything they have now in America in the bottom of the main picture you see all the peasants know the small businessman the factory work of the farmer they're down there begging and they're giving all of their profits all of their wealth to the new nobility the captains of industry and we see them controlling things through legislation you see that written on the sword because now these trust control business I you see trust across this banner you see tariffs and monopoly all of these things are helping tools that the rich use to make themselves richer and their Castle is a factory so certainly this idea of wealth and who should have it and is this fair it's all the minds of Americans by the end of the time period nouveau riche continued so we've talked about some views of wealth some people think that wealth is bad that the Rockefeller and Carnegie are bad men because they abuse people we saw it in the robber baron cartoon and so we called them you know robber barons other people like Andrew Carnegie believe that wealth is good they're captains of industry they provide jobs karna he also believes that wealth is good because then you can give back to society and help other people so we have these competing views of wealth is it good or bad who should have it and who shud shouldn't and so we get another view of wealth we get this thing called social Darwinism by William Graham Sumner when Graham Sumner is this guy and he says that wealth is actually good he says that wealth is an indication of who are the better human beings right at this time we see evolution coming out Charles Darwin's Origin of Species and so Charles Graham a William Graham Sumner says look if there's ever in the animal world there must be evolution in the human world survival of the fittest and so if rich people are rich it's because they are something in their DNA or something in their makeup makes them better people they're super humans and all the people that are poor that we see in the pictures the little boys working in a mine or this family struggling to just feed themselves they're poor because well they're lesser humans there's something wrong with them so don't help them let them die out if you let them die you're just going to make humanity better let the rich survive and prosper and let the poor die and humanity will get rid of the bad end of the gene pool obviously this is a very harsh way of looking at humanity and wealth but it is a view of wealth that comes out at this time next the new South the new South we briefly mentioned it before it was on one of your study cards the new South is this idea during Reconstruction right between 1865 and 1877 when the south is being rebuilt what should the South be rebuilt as should it be an agrarian country part of the country that still just grows cash crops or should it be industrial and the goal of the new south is to make the South the carbon copy of the North is to make them industrial to build railroads to increase cotton production but also build textile mills in the south it makes sense if the cotton is in the South you can reduce your costs by building that the factory right next to it that turns that cotton into textiles and so we see this idea that we're going to build make the South industrial so on the left hand side we see more railroads built in the South this time to benefit business and on the right hand side we see a comparison between the amount of textiles being produced in New England to the amount of textiles being produced in the south and over time we see New England starts to lose its dominance of the textile industry and the South gained its dominance and it takes a long time that that trend starts um in the last half of the 19th century when we see this dream of a new industrial South start is it successful well we know it is in the textile industry but does the new self help actually african-americans have a better standard of living and the answer is no if you're going to open up a new factory in the south we see that white people are going to own the factories and they're going to hire other white people and so for these higher paying factory jobs we're going to see poor white people benefit they're going to get the jobs to work in the factories but african-americans are going to be stuck sharecropping they're going to be they're going to be stuck in poverty um and then we're going to see the face they don't get these higher paying jobs they go to the white people and so certainly the new South helps white people but it does not help african-americans next who are the people who invest in the new South they're going to be mostly northerners and so the north is going to open up these textile factories not southerners the southerners are still broke from the Civil War and so the north is going to be the one that actually owns the factories even though they're in the south the north is going to be the one that owns the railroads that owns the banks and so the South still is kind of treated like in a cop like a colony the North has most of the manufacturing or even if they don't have the manufacturing it's in the south they still are making all the profits and so the North becomes very industrial still like we see in the map and the South has a few industries textile but that's about it so that the view of this new South outside of textile manufacturing we're just not going to see it we're not going to see a lot of steel industry or other things happen in the
