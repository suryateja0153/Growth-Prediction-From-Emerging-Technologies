 I'm Brad and today I'm building my biggest project yet this a seven foot dining table and it was a doozy I wanted this table to be really awesome so I enlisted help from my buddy Matt at Rustic River Creations he makes custom tables in furniture south of Nashville and has this amazing shop and some great machinery to match oh and a green Grove now the dining table is gonna be seven feet long and almost four feet wide and Matt had some white oak boards that would fit this build perfectly if you don't start with good lumber your projects can go south pretty quickly so we sorted through the boards checking their shape and then their moisture content now to check their levels we use the Orion 950 pinless moisture meter from Wagner meters the sponsor of today's video I'll talk more about the meter later but we calibrated it for the white oak that we were using in pick boards for the top with similar moisture levels even though we picked some of the straighter boards we're still dealing with rough lumber and these suckers were nine feet long in an inch and a half thick so Matt being the stand-up guy he is graciously offered to help me mill the boards to get a flat face in one straight edge he does this day in and day out so he's set up with all kinds of awesome side feet and out feet on his machines they can handle this size lumber after cutting the boards to rough length he showed me this cool jig that he uses to straighten the planks before hitting the jointer it's an eight-foot length of plywood that he attached two by fours and toggle clamps onto a foot board has a large bend or crook in it you can quickly get a straight edge on it with one run through the saw as it cuts the front in the back of the board that overhangs the jig after this we could hit his ridiculously large jointer for face and edge joining to get the board's flat on one side and one edge this 16 inch beast of a jointer made my 8 inch jointer look like Steve Rogers before the Super Soldier Serum how honestly I don't think I could have managed lumber this size in my current shop so if you don't have a friend like Matt and you can't handle this much lumber you can go to a lumber yard that sells both rough and milled lumber we ended up with what you would call s1 s1 II which means surface one side and one edge and this is gonna let me finish it off on my shop so you might be able to buy that at your local lumber supplier and you can also still get a discount versus buying s4s which is serviced on all sides if you need any custom rustic furniture please hit up Matt and he's gonna take care of you I brought the wood back to my shop and I unloaded it onto my table-saw to acclimate in my shop artem back in my shop and now I'm gonna take the board I've got a straightedge and one straight face and I'm gonna run them through the planer and then the table saw to get them to the right size for their glue up I also set up a temporary work table I'm dealing with some really large boards here there's seven 1/2 feet long right now and the tables gonna be 4 feet wide so I don't have a full four by eight sheet of MDF I'm gonna use this as my work surface because none of my benches are gonna be close enough to even being able to handle all that lumber so I'm gonna go ahead and mill this stuff up and then we'll get to the Assembly of the top and while I'm planing these boards here's why I let them sit for a week in my shop in how I knew when they were good now at Matt shop we use the Orion 950 from Wagner meters to measure the woods moisture content this is a premium pinless moisture meter it's got a seven year warranty and calibrated accuracy but what moisture is relative to the environment that you're in so things could change at my shop now the Orion 950 has a feature called equilibrium moisture content or EMC it uses a built in temperature and humidity sensor to calculate the percentage where wood is gonna stop losing or gaining moisture in that specific environment I saw that the EMC in my shop is nine point eight percent and when the board's got close to that I knew that I was good to start milling if you want to get more information about the Orion 950 I'll have a link down below in the description to it and thanks to Wagner meters for sponsoring this video and now I just needed to rip the boards down to the final width for the size top that I wanted I find that top over 40 inches it's gonna give you the best chance at avoiding prying hands from stealing your food across the table now of course if you run out of a suits dealer you may want to go narrower for a full table access got all the boards cut to length and I put them out I went ahead and clamp them together because one of the things I want to make sure is that the joints were all good you don't want to get into the glue up and then notice that you have gaps so I did see some areas where there were gaps and they're a little bit too much for what I wanted and I squeezed them together and it still didn't pull them tight so I'm gonna join a few of those boards that are next to each other to get those joints just right and then we're gonna go on to getting some alignment on them and when you're joining two boards that will be glued together the best option is to fold them up onto their sides like you're closing a book right along that joint then take the boards to the jointer in that exact orientation now this is gonna eliminate any gaps caused by a slightly AB square setup on the jointer I went through and I folded up each set of mating boards that had gaps and I ran them through until everything fit tightly now after that I laid the wood back down on the table and I set it up how I wanted it for my finished product I put a big V across all the boards with a pencil as a reference mark to keep them in order then I went through and I made marks across the joints about 20 inches apart for every board and this will be for biscuits that I'm gonna use for alignment during the glue up I cut the biscuit slots on the mating boards using the marks across the joints as indicators and just be careful to make sure that the biscuit joiner's fence is rested firmly on the board now without knowing it I cut this slot too high as because the dust hose was hitting the board behind it and not letting that tool set flat and I didn't recognize it I cut the slots in all the boards and then did one final dry fit just to make sure everything was good before I glue up and I used the biscuits in there as well now the last thing you want here is to run into an issue when you're three minutes deep into assembly with glue drying and you're gonna start panicking believe me I have been there and after all that prep the glue up does go a lot more smoothly since you know how everything fits together and you've already done it once I glued one board at a time putting the biscuits in for registration and lining the board's up with the marks that I've made earlier I only put glue on one side of each board and it's always served me well gluing both sides is overkill in my book and it's a lot Messier all you really want to have is some good glue squeeze-out when you put the clamps on it and then you know that you've got a good joint I used a mallet to level out a few spots that had crept up and then I put a few more clamps on the top and after 45 minutes I came back and I scraped the partially dry glue beads off of the top it makes final flattening a bit easier plus it is super satisfying now the next day I came back and I cleared out any of the knot holes in the table and gave it a rough sanding - 80 grit in those spots this is basically just to get rid of any glue around the knot holes so I can make sure I cleanly filled them the boards are full of different knots and imperfections which I love because it adds some nice character I marked all the spots that needed filling with blue tape and then I mixed up some epoxy I'm using total boat high-performance with a fast hardener for the filling here and instead of leaving it clear I went ahead and added some black mix all tint to it I think the black accents the knots without being too gaudy I filled all the holes and I used the torch to release the bubbles and help level it a bit I tried to top the knots off as the epoxy seeped into the cracks but I came back a couple hours later in a few spots still needed more filling so if you want to hit them in one shot you're gonna need to babysit those voids and keep adding epoxy until it all hardens I decided to switch gears and jump to the metal base before finishing the table top so then I could bounce back and forth between them while the finishes were drying the worst part about metal working in a wood shop is the metal shavings go everywhere so I decided to rig up a quick barrier to capture it before I spewed steel all over my shop I used big sheet of cardboard that I got from a plywood stack and I cut and bent it to make a 4x4 box that was 12 inches deep and I put that right behind my chop saw it only took me a few minutes to make and it was well worth the time in the effort I think this might work the table is going to have a metal base at each end made from 1 by 3 rectangular tube steel the eighth inch thick each base is a t-shape on the floor with vertical supporting legs going up to a top plate I started off by cutting the six vertical leg parts to rough size that I could manage the steel a little bit easier each upright is square at the top and it's gonna be joined into that lower T shape with a 45 degree miter I set the fins using a carpenter's square which I think is illegal when you're metalworking but then I just started cutting the 45s on the end of each leg and I quickly realized something aren't a quick little tip here you may have just seen that but one thing you want to think about when you're cutting the tube steel is that there's a seam so the way that this is made is exactly rolled in on each other in seamed here and that actually does have a little texture to it so I actually don't want these on the outside of the legs I want the smooth side to be on the outside so I cut the miter on the wrong side on this one but what I'll do is I'll put this on the inside where you're not gonna see it in the outside legs I will make sure to cut the 45s so that the smooth side is gonna be on the outside I finished up cutting all the minors on the legs and then I switched to the lower T pieces now the longer top portion of the tea has miters at both ends to match up with the legs for this part and the smaller base piece I position the metal seam down towards the floor I finished up by cutting all the legs to final size a scrap block clamped down to the bench gave a stop to make repeatable cuts and since I have six legs to deal with the chances are pretty high that can get out of whack so starting with the exact sized pieces at least gives me a fighting chance now next I went outside and I ground down all the parts where they would be welded to give me a good base for the filler material to go I'm by no stretch a good welder yet but I am learning I have this small folding welding table that's a bit undersized for the task at hand but using some right angle jigs and clamps I was able to get everything aligned in in place my Lincoln Electric Power MIG 210 mph and is more than capable for this job I love this thing because it's simple as dialing in the wire size and the gauge of the steel that I'm using and then I was ready to go I'm figuring out the best way to assemble this was a good mental exercise and I'm pretty sure that I do it the same way next time I started by attaching the upright legs to that lower piece that had the two miters on it i tacked those pieces in place and then I marked and cut a top plate from quarter-inch flat bar stock the top plate is gonna extend a few inches past the legs on each side for extra support for the top I turned the assembly upside down on top of the flat bar and then I pried it back into square using a spreader clamp the heat from the welds on those miners that I'd already done tends to move things in so the metal was inside a bit checking for square is really crucial before you weld your final pieces after tacking the plate in place I went around and I finished all the welds on this square assembly and made sure everything was sealed up and then I clamped and welded together the third leg and that small base piece from there I butted this assembly against the square that had already made to form the t shape and the last piece of the puzzle was to flip the whole thing over and add another top plate to lock everything together after that I could repeat this entire process on the second base and these are super sturdy again I am NOT a great welder by any stretch but I here grinder and paint make you the welder you ain't so I got to grinding the wall does now before painting the basis I hop back to the tabletop so that I could fit the threaded inserts I knocked off the majority of the epoxy with a block plane and then I finished smoothing off the surface with 80 grit sandpaper we have left the boards about 6 inches long when we milled them which was great because I did have a little bit of snipe on the end of them I measured in three inches from each side and I set my tracks all square at 90 degrees to the long edge then I cut each end to give my final length for the table after that I could drill the mounting holes on the top of the metal bases I put them at the ends of the tee as well as the intersection I used a step bit and I drilled them a little bit oversized to allow for wood movement then I hooked the base up onto the top which was bottom side up so that I could mark for the inserts and that grimace on my face means I need to stop skipping workouts I put the base 12 inches in from the end and I centered it on the table and then I drew pencil marks through each hole and after that I can take the bases off and prime and paint them outside with a matte black finish while the paint was drying I worked on finishing up the top I added a chamfer on all the edges of the table and if you start off putting the chamfer on the corner first and then you rout around it on the top you get this really cool-looking detail on the corners I finished up routing all the other edges and corners and during the whole ordeal we had to flip the top over a couple times I really can't understate how heavy this thing is or how much I need to work out but after I routed all the edges and sanded everything smooth I decided to go ahead and apply finish to the bottom before doing the inserts I'm using rubio pure as my finish and it goes on easily but you have to rub it in with a white scotch brite pad so i thought it would be smart to put it on my sandra do this I poured finish on one spot and then I put the sander down in the finish and turn it on and spread it around and this worked great but then I poured a big line of it and went into that line of finish with my sander running full board this did not work great it's not finished all over my shop so don't do that anyway after that I used a center punch where I had made the pencil marks for the inserts and then I drilled out the holes for them and I installed the inserts with an impact driver we flipped over the table again so that I could finish off the top and here's my recommended approach spread the finish on so that it's not pooled anywhere and it's got a nice coverage then you can go back with a sander with a white pad and buff things in unless you like spraying oil all over your shop then by all means go the other way now the nice thing about this table is that you can move it separately and attach it to the bases with set screws and I'll have to wait until after lockdown to get some help so I can move this into my dining room and get my dining room table out of there and everything in place I've got some more build up for you you can check them out right over there and I will see you in the next video where we're gonna build something awesome
