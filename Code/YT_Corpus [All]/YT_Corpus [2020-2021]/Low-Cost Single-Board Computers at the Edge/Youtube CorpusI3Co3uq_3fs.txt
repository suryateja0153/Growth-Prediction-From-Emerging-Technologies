 hi I'm Lorena Saedi founder and Managing Partner of Saedi Law Group I wanted to introduce you to a new way our firm is reaching out to meet with potential clients our law firm proudly serves the entire Northern District of Georgia we cover the Atlanta, Gainesville, Rome and Newnan bankruptcy court divisions and while we offer 10 locations to meet with clients in person we have come to realize that there are many Georgians who don't have easy access to our offices and need immediate help with the potential bankruptcy filing too often than not we see clients who just use the closest attorney to them instead of working with the most qualified an affordable attorney to assist them with the bankruptcy filing. Times have changed since I filed my first bankruptcy case 17 years ago today almost everyone uses video conferencing for speed and convenience in Georgia both the state and federal courts use some sort of video conferencing and almost all businesses today use video conferencing to reduce costs and expand the reach to consumers since we have launched this service we have had an amazing response from clients many people would much rather conduct a very private financial interview in the comfort of their own home as opposed to coming in to an attorney's office we completely understand and that's why we've started to offer video consultations we invite you to schedule a time to review your issues with one of our attorneys in a completely free and confidential session as long as you have a smart phone you can have a bankruptcy attorney to protect your rights the very same day I invite you to check out our website at www,fightdebtgeorgia.com
