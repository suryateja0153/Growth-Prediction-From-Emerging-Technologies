 Hey folks, it's Ray at DCRAINMAKER.COM here. And today I've got "7 New Things To Know" about the brand new Garmin Edge 130 Plus. Now this is actually the 2nd bike computer that Garmin came out with today. The first one was the Garmin Edge 1030 Plus, which cost like three times as much as this thing right here, and it's got admittedly like, ninety times more features. So if you want all the information on that one, it's up in the corner there. But for now we're just gonna get right into all the new things on the 130 Plus...but before we do that a quick note! It looks exactly the same as the 130. Like, literally it looks it's identical like exterior-wise, everything's the same from the outside. It's still black, it's still...it's the same. Though it actually has less batter, though I guess that's technically not a new feature, it's a reduction of features. But the reason they did that is because people didn't get the battery life they claimed in the past [with the original Edge 130], so they fixed that...by reducing the battery life claims. Now with that all said, the first feature on the list is structured workouts and this is kind of a biggie so the problem with the edge 130 in the past was that people kind of thought it was sort of like an edge 500 series device but cheaper and smaller in the reality as it wasn't it was just a more simplistic GPS with the edge 130 plus you see Garmin across the board adding the structure workout or more advanced features now the way it works right here is on structure workout so you go in the top and you hold on this upper right hand button and that brings you down to training this is where you can load any courses in there or training plans these courses can come from Garmin Connect or Garmin Connect mobile as well as from third-party partners like for example training Peaks or trainerroad or anything really that can sync courses to your garment you can pull them up here in my case I'm gonna go into workouts and I've got two workouts there this one of the bottom hair called Tunnel Bora is the one I'm gonna do here in just a couple hours that's my workout from for today from China Road so I can clip this open and I can go down to view and then I can look at the workout so you can see the steps right there or sorry the interval kind of graph if you will and if I go down you can see the actual steps so if you look there you see warm-up and then I rest until that process is sort of outside workout and then down below I've got like seven minutes at 262 to you to watts and then rest for three minutes and then repeat that four times in total so to actually do the workout you'll press the do workout button and I'm gonna go ahead and I'm just gonna press it start here and I come away from GPS the left-hand side you have the target power the top you have lap power you have time to go for this particular interval and then on the right hand side you have the power and the target for this particular interval as well as the graph at the bottom and then as you go through that workout will automatically iterate from section to section based on how the work gets defined the targets that are defined and how it sequences from each step to the next step now one thing that won't do those that will not control your smart trainer at least not today but that gets to feature number two which is the ability to control your smart trainer soon government says a firmware update is coming very very near-term we're not talking like fall or anything like that but much sooner that allow you to pair to an an plus FEC smart trainer and then you can control that smart trainer and in turn use intervals and things like that on your structure workout or on your edge 130-plus just like you would have had in the past or do have already on edge 500 series or 1000 series trainer that functionality is coming down to this here speaking of things that may be interesting here is hitting that like button in the corner if you do that it really helps out this video and the channel quite a bit next we'll get to part my favorite feature in the Garmin lineup in the last couple years which was climbed bro something they added to the edge 5:30 and 8:30 about a year ago and those came out and then to the 10:30 over the summer last year and now it is on the 130 plus here so the way it works a load up of course here by holding the right hand upper button go down into navigation courses there we go and I can load any course but I'm a little this one right here Sokolow bruh in my Orca which is one of my favorite places to ride but if we go down you can see the elevation graph by itself is like oh that will probably be painful and sure it would indeed be painful but if we go back there we can go down to two climbs and what this does is that automatically defines each one of the climb is based on bunch of criteria that Garmin has you can see each one of those they're so inclined where three starts at fourteen point seven miles for an average gradient at 11 percentage and I'm going crack one of these open now but click on the bottom there and this shows me the actual climb now of course because it's not a color screen you don't get to see all the gradient stuff that you would on garments higher-end units but you can still roughly figure out that's gonna suck like that's this is the ten kilometer climb it's gonna send 3,600 feet over the course that climbs so like this is gonna hurt and not this is going to this did hurt I've done this climb on other units in this this would definitely hurt next on the list is the new instant detection now instant detection on garmin device has been around a while and basically it means if you crash it'll notify your friends and family but the problem was that in the past the edge 130 didn't actually have an accelerometer net so without an accelerometer they couldn't do incident action now they've got an accelerometer here now they can so the way that works is that you go and you configure it using Garmin Connect mobile that's a smartphone app you do have to have your phone with you because this doesn't have cellular connectivity in it itself so it uses Bluetooth smart it's your smart phone and if you have a high g-force impacting event coupled with a stop uh some sort so it's actually looking at those two things together then it'll trigger an alarm here you've got about ten seconds or so to go ahead and either cancel it if it's a false positive or it'll go ahead then and notify your contacts that you've had an instant it'll send your contacts a link where they can find where you are it's a live track link so if you were picked up by an ambulance they could actually follow that to the hospital and again it's been around a while for the most part I rarely have false positive issues when I do they tend to be that I have braked really really quickly and gone off a side of a sidewalk at the same time which I know it sounds like a weird combination but it does happen also things that happen are crashes which it comes with mountain biking which gets to our next feature which is the added mountain biking dynamics or mountain biking metrics this is something it again and came on a five thirty eight thirty a year ago and it's now on the 130 plus now mountain bike dynamics leverage is a hard word accelerometer in the edge 130 plus to go ahead and basically give you grades or metrics against the Train so you get grit and flow and jumps in if you measure jump distance and jump duration and all that stuff is on here unfortunately I don't have any mountains to mountain bike down to actually anything even close to impressive metrics I've literally got pancake flat and ground the good news though is my friend does if it does have mountains and does have a mountain bike can actually can competently mountain bike so check out his video on the bottom there which has more details on the mountain bike metrics for the edge 130 plus next however is something that I'm gonna play with a bit lately which is the new live track with courses option live track of course isn't newest but something that's been on government devices for the better part of a decade now and it's been ignored for the better part of a decade now but with the new live track course feature you can toggle the option to send your course information from this so from your edge 130-plus up to garment connectors so that when you do share that live track link with friends and family they actually see your course that's pretty darn useful so the way it works is you'll see your planned course on the live track link or your friends will see that rather and then they can see exactly where you are and even when you deviate from the course as well so it's kind of cool to be able to see that yes you're going where you're supposed to be going or no you're off just simply getting ice cream or donuts which are I mean a totally valid I'm not judging I'm just saying that your friends can see that now so beware if you toggle that that they're gonna know so that brings us to a last item on the list which is improved setup flow so there's essentially two parts to this the first part is that we'll go ahead and automatically pull in your activity profile details from past Garmin devices so when you're using a smart phone to set up the edge 1:30 plus it'll ask you if you'd like to import your activity settings from past Garmin devices now it's pulling from the edge one thousand five twenty five twenty plus eight twenty eight thirty five thirty ten to basically anything made in the last like six years or so from an edge device standpoint it'll pull that in now keep in mind some data fields don't transfer in for example there is no normalized power data field in this so I can't pull that in there's regular power fields but not that one so it doesn't best to kind of condense what you've got if you've got different fields into this smaller form factor you can have up to eight data fields on a given screen here so you can probably at least cover the way you've configure those fields and then pull them all in and you'll see them right there for your default activity profile of course there's only one activity profile unless you don't have multiple profiles so you don't even have to go ahead and get one of those profiles your default one pulled on to the 130 plus the second feature though is more simplistic which is it pulls all of your sensors so any amp us or Bluetooth smart sensor that you pair to any Garmin device in the last 365 days worth of uploads to Garmin Connect is instantiated on this you can choose not to if you don't want to but they're all here so all your bikes all your friends bikes that you paired for some strange reason they're all here it's a pretty cool feature like for me having so many devices to test it's great for the edge 130 plus it'll store or show your most recent twenty sensors which in my case is like two weeks worth of devices but for normal people that's be like your entire lifetime worth of devices that are now pulled on to here right away now if you're looking for even more information about the 130 plus things like accuracy you know GPS accuracy in particular or the nuance of some of these features especially some of the non new features so for example Ostrava live segments or courses in general and all that kind of stuff I've got that my full written review which you can see on the screen right now that's pretty darn long and it covers again anything you could possibly want on the edge 130 plus so with that hopefully found this interesting if so go ahead mark that life but at the bottom there okay subscribe for plenty more sports Technology goodness as I mentioned in some recent videos companies starting to work a bit on announcements so I think we're going to keep this cadence up of new stuff pretty frequently for the next little while with that have a good one
